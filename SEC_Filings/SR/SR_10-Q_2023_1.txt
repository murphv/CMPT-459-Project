NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
– These notes are an integral part of the accompanying unaudited financial statements of Spire Inc. (“Spire” or the “Company”) presented on a consolidated basis, Spire Missouri Inc. (“Spire Missouri”) and Spire Alabama Inc. (“Spire Alabama”). Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth Inc. (“Spire EnergySouth”) are wholly owned subsidiaries of Spire. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth (Spire Gulf Inc. and Spire Mississippi Inc.) are collectively referred to as the “Utilities.”
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information with the instructions to Form
10 -Q and Rule
10 - 01
of Regulation S‑X. Accordingly, they do
not
include all the disclosures required for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented. This Form
10 -Q should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Financial Statements contained in Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama’s combined Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2022 .
The consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of Spire include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries. Transactions and balances between consolidated entities have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements of Spire. In compliance with GAAP, transactions between Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama and their affiliates, as well as intercompany balances on their balance sheets, have
not
been eliminated from their separate financial statements.
Certain information is presented by reportable segment, as described below. Effective during the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
the Company changed its reportable segments to reflect changes in the way its chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of its operations, develops strategy and allocates capital resources. Specifically, Midstream, which was formerly included in Other is now reported separately. The Company's historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
– Spire has
three  reportable segments: Gas Utility, Gas Marketing, and Midstream. The Gas Utility segment consists of the regulated natural gas distribution operations of the Company and is the core business segment of Spire in terms of revenue and earnings. The Gas Utility segment is comprised of the operations of: Spire Missouri, serving St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri; Spire Alabama, serving central and northern Alabama; and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, serving the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi. The Gas Marketing segment includes Spire’s largest gas-related business, Spire Marketing Inc. (“Spire Marketing”), which provides non-regulated natural gas services throughout the United States (U.S.). The Midstream segment includes Spire Storage and Spire STL Pipeline, which are subsidiaries engaged in the storage and transportation of natural gas. The activities of the Company’s other subsidiaries are reported as Other and are described in  Note
9 , Information by Operating Segment. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama each have a single reportable segment.
Nearly all the Company’s earnings are derived from its Gas Utility segment. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities’ business and the volumetric Spire Missouri rate design, earnings are typically concentrated during the heating season of
November
through
April
each fiscal year. As a result, the interim statements of income for Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are
not
necessarily indicative of annual results or representative of succeeding quarters of the fiscal year.

Table of Contents
REGULATED OPERATIONS
–
The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic
980,
Regulated Operations . This topic sets forth the application of GAAP for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent
third -party regulator. The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions
may
result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. In addition, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process.
As authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC) and the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC), the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) riders allow the Utilities to pass through to customers the cost of purchased gas supplies. Regulatory assets and liabilities related to the PGA clauses and the GSA riders are both labeled Unamortized Purchased Gas Adjustments herein. See additional information about regulatory assets and liabilities in  Note
4 , Regulatory Matters.
DERIVATIVES
– In the course of their business, certain subsidiaries of Spire enter into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. Certain of their derivative natural gas contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and, as such, are excluded from the scope of FASB ASC Topic
815,
Derivatives and Hedging . Those contracts are accounted for as executory contracts and recorded on an accrual basis. Revenues and expenses from such contracts are recorded gross. Contracts
not
designated as normal purchases or normal sales are recorded as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to physical delivery. Certain of Spire Marketing’s wholesale purchase and sale transactions are classified as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, with income and expenses presented on a net basis in natural gas expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Spire also enters into cash flow hedges through execution of interest rate swap contracts to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates.
TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
–
Transactions between affiliates of the Company have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements of Spire. As reflected in their separate financial statements, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama borrowed funds from the Company and incurred related interest. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also participated in normal intercompany shared services transactions. Spire Missouri’s and Spire Alabama’s other transactions with affiliates are presented below:

RESTRICTED CASH
– In Spire’s statement of cash flows for the period ended
December 31, 2022 , total Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash included $ 14.2  and $ 14.0  of restricted cash reported in “Other Investments” on the Company’s balance sheet as of
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022 , respectively (in addition to amounts shown as “Cash and cash equivalents”). This restricted cash has been segregated and invested in debt securities in a trust account based on collateral requirements for reinsurance at Spire’s risk management company.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
– Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the amounts due from customers, including unbilled amounts. Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectible. An allowance for expected credit losses is estimated and updated based on relevant data and trends such as accounts receivable aging, historical write-off experience, current write-off trends, economic conditions, and the impact of weather and availability of customer payment assistance on collection trends. For the Utilities, net write-offs as a percentage of revenue has historically been the best predictor of base net write-off experience over time. Management judgment is applied in the development of the allowance due to the complexity of variables and subjective nature of certain relevant factors. The accounts receivable of Spire’s non-utility businesses are evaluated separately from those of the Utilities. The allowance for credit losses for those other businesses is based on a continuous evaluation of the individual counterparty risk and is
not
significant for the periods presented. Activity in the allowance for credit losses is shown in the following table.

Like all the Company’s regulatory assets, these regulatory assets as of
December 31, 2022  are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. The recovery period for the future income taxes due from customers and pension and other postretirement benefit costs could be
20
years or longer, based on current Internal Revenue Service guidelines and average remaining service life of active participants, respectively. The recovery period for the PGA assets is less than
two
years. The other items
not
earning a return are expected to be recovered over a period
not
to exceed
15
years, consistent with precedent set by the MoPSC, except for certain debt costs expected to be recovered over the related debt term, up to
35
years. Spire Alabama does
not
have any regulatory assets that are
not
earning a return.
Spire Missouri
In mid-
February 2021,
the central U.S. experienced a period of unusually severe cold weather (“Winter Storm Uri”), and Spire Missouri implemented an Operational Flow Order (OFO) to preserve the integrity of its distribution system. During this time, Spire Missouri was required to purchase additional natural gas supply, both to ensure adequate supply for its firm utility customers, and to cover the shortfall created when
third -party marketers failed to deliver natural gas supply to its city gates on behalf of their customers. In accordance with its MoPSC-approved OFO tariff, Spire Missouri invoiced the cost of gas and associated penalties totaling $ 195.8
to non-compliant marketers and recorded accounts receivable. Recoveries collected are an offset to cost of natural gas for firm utility customers through the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) and Actual Cost Adjustment (ACA), so are net income neutral to Spire Missouri. The
three
largest counterparties did
not
remit payment when due, so Spire Missouri filed suit against them in federal court to recover the invoiced amounts. In late
February 2022,
the parties to the OFO waiver suits agreed to a settlement in principle, pursuant to which marketers will reimburse Spire Missouri for the actual cost of its incremental gas purchases to serve marketers’ customers during Winter Storm Uri, so Spire Missouri reduced revenue, accounts receivable, cost of gas and regulatory liabilities by approximately $ 150
in the
second
quarter of fiscal
2022.
The settlement, which reduced the total amount due from the
three
marketers to approximately $ 42 , was approved by the MoPSC in late
May 2022,
and the marketers are making payments to Spire Missouri.

Table of Contents
The MoPSC approved compliance tariffs with an effective date of
December 23, 2021,
in Spire Missouri’s general rate case GR- 2021 - 0108.
These new tariffs were designed to increase Spire Missouri’s aggregate annual gross base rate revenues by $ 72.2 , which includes $ 24.9
incremental and $ 47.3
already being collected through the Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The decision, as reflected in the amended report and order dated
November 12, 2021,
revised the MoPSC’s long-standing position regarding Spire Missouri’s compliance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Uniform System of Accounts (USOA) on the capitalization of prudently incurred non-operational overheads. The amended report and order required Spire Missouri to cease capitalization of these overhead costs at the time new rates went into effect until a MoPSC staff audit of their revised interpretation of compliance with the USOA framework could be completed. MoPSC staff completed this audit and filed its audit report on
March 18, 2022.
The report recommended changes to Spire Missouri’s overhead capitalization rates based upon its new time study and the results of the audit. On
April 13, 2022,
the MoPSC issued an Order Authorizing Accounting Treatment clarifying that Spire Missouri
may
defer all non-operational overheads from
December 23, 2021
forward into a regulatory asset for future review by the MoPSC in an appropriate proceeding. The total amount deferred under this order was $ 42.8
through
September 30, 2022,
comprising:
•
$ 19.0  in accordance with new capitalization rates determined by the study and audit;
•
$ 18.8  of prudent costs which are in excess of the capitalization rates determined by the study and audit; and
•
$ 5.0
of prudent costs related to an
April 2022
ISRS settlement.
On
April 1, 2022,
Spire Missouri filed tariff sheets to initiate a new general rate case proceeding intended to address the deferred amounts, along with other matters. The parties reached a Full Unanimous Stipulation and Agreement (the “Stipulation”) to resolve all issues in the case, which was filed with the MoPSC on
November 4, 2022.
On
November 18, 2022,
the Stipulation was approved, including authorization of $ 78.0
in new base rate revenue and recovery of deferred overheads through amortization of the related regulatory assets discussed in the previous paragraph. New base rates became effective on
December 26, 2022.
The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to replace qualifying components of its infrastructure without the necessity of a formal rate case. On
December 27, 2022,
Spire Missouri filed an ISRS case seeking accelerated recovery of $ 8.8
in annual revenue for eligible pipe replacement from
October 2022
through
February 2023.
The MoPSC staff has been ordered to file its recommendation regarding this request by
March 27, 2023.
All prior ISRS revenues have been reset to
zero
as of
December 26, 2022
as a result of Spire Missouri's most recent base rate case.
On
May 27, 2022,
the MoPSC staff filed an ACA Review Recommendation and Report for the ACA period that
first
includes transportation charges incurred by Spire Missouri for service on the Spire STL Pipeline. That report concluded that the transaction complied with Missouri affiliate transaction rules and was prudent, and it recommended
no
disallowance of any Spire STL Pipeline related costs from the ACA mechanism. On
July 11, 2022,
Spire Missouri filed its response comments in support of the recommendation. The Missouri Office of the Public Counsel and Environmental Defense Fund filed comments on
July 29
and
August 1, 2022,
respectively, raising concerns about the Spire STL Pipeline transaction, the ACA process itself, and other matters. The MoPSC has entered a scheduling order in the matter which includes an evidentiary hearing on
July 25- 26,
2023.
On
January 6, 2023,
Spire Missouri filed a Partial Stipulation and Agreement resolving all other issues raised by the MoPSC staff in its Recommendation and Report. The partial stipulation was approved by the MoPSC on
January 25, 2023,
and will result in a $ 0.6
disallowance from the ACA balance. Issues relating to Spire STL Pipeline costs remain contested.
The MoPSC has initiated their annual ACA dockets (GR- 2022 - 0135
and GR- 2022 - 0136 ) to audit gas commodity and transportation costs for the
2020 - 2021
heating season, which includes the impact of Winter Storm Uri on Spire Missouri's natural gas portfolio. On
December 15, 2022,
the MoPSC staff filed its Reports and Recommendations in these cases.  Spire Missouri filed its responses to these Reports and Recommendations on
January 19, 2023.
The MoPSC has
not
yet taken any further action in these dockets.
The Utilities purchase the natural gas to be delivered to their customers and typically defer the recovery of this expense thereby lessening the immediate impact on customers’ bills of higher realized commodity costs. These deferred gas balances are expected to be recovered over the next
12 - 18
months pursuant to tariff adjustments effective in Missouri (and Alabama). Spire Missouri filed Purchase Gas Adjustment (PGA) changes to its tariff in
November
and
January
which were approved and became effective
November 29, 2022
and
January 19, 2023,
respectively.

Spire Alabama
On
October 26, 2022,
Spire Alabama made its annual Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) rate filing with the APSC, presenting the utility’s budget for the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2023,
including net income and a calculation of allowed return on average common equity (ROE). The budget reflected the start of amortization of the accumulated deferred income tax (ADIT) adjustment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of
2017
(TCJA). Following a regulatory review, adjusted rates became effective
January 1, 2023.
Spire Alabama filed GSA rate increases effective
December 1, 2022,
and
January  1,
2023,
primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices.
Spire
In addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is affected by the following regulatory matters.
In
October 2022,
Spire Gulf made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC based on its budget for fiscal
2023
and an allowed ROE of
9.95 %. The budget reflected the start of amortization of the excess ADIT from the TCJA. New rates designed to provide increased annual revenues of $ 2.5
became effective
January 1, 2023.
On
September 14, 2022,
Spire Mississippi filed its Rate Stabilization Adjustment Rider with the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC) for the rate year ended
June 30, 2022,
which reflected an increase to annual revenues of $ 1.3 . The MSPSC, by its order dated
December 6, 2022,
approved a stipulation agreement between the Mississippi Public Utility Staff and Spire Mississippi that provides for increased annual revenues of $ 0.8
through rates that became effective on
January 1, 2023.
In
August 2018,
the FERC approved an order issuing a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Spire STL Pipeline (
“August 2018
Order”). In
November 2018,
the FERC issued a Notice to Proceed, and in
November 2019,
Spire STL Pipeline received FERC authorization to place the pipeline into service. Also, in
November 2019,
the FERC issued an Order on Rehearing of the
August 2018
Order dismissing or denying the outstanding requests for rehearing filed by several parties, dismissing the request for stay filed by
one
party, and noting the withdrawal of the request for rehearing by another party. In
January 2020,
two
of the rehearing parties filed petitions for review of the FERC’s orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“DC Circuit”). On
June 22, 2021,
the DC Circuit issued an order vacating the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and remanding the matter back to the FERC for further action. On
September 14, 2021  and
December 3, 2021,
the FERC issued temporary certificates to allow the Spire STL Pipeline to continue operating indefinitely while it considers approval of a new permanent certificate. Certain parties in the temporary certificate proceedings sought rehearing of the FERC’s
December 3, 2021
temporary certificate. The FERC denied rehearing by operation of law on
February 3, 2022
and by substantive order on
February 17, 2022.
On
March 7, 2022,
one
group of the rehearing parties filed in the DC Circuit a petition for review of the FERC’s
December 3, 2021
temporary certificate order limited to whether the temporary certificates carry eminent domain authority. On
June 29, 2022,
the DC Circuit issued an order holding the appeal of the
December 3, 2021
temporary certificate in abeyance, and this proceeding remains in abeyance. On
December 15, 2022,
the FERC issued its order on remand reissuing a permanent certificate of public convenience and necessity for the continued operation of Spire STL Pipeline. Such order is subject to rehearing or potential appeal, and on
January 17, 2023,
the Environmental Defense Fund filed for rehearing.

FINANCING
Short-term
Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have a syndicated revolving credit facility pursuant to a loan agreement with
12  banks, which was amended
July 22, 2022,
to increase the commitment and sublimits and extend the agreement through
July  22,
2027.
The amended loan agreement has an aggregate credit commitment of $ 1,300.0 , including sublimits of $ 450.0
for the Spire holding company, $ 575.0
for Spire Missouri and $ 275.0
for Spire Alabama. These sublimits
may
be reallocated from time to time among the
three
borrowers within the
$1,300.0
aggregate commitment, with commitment fees and interest margins applied for each borrower relative to its credit rating, as well as sustainability rate adjustments based on Spire's DART (“Days Away Restricted or Transferred”) rate and methane emissions reductions. The Spire holding company
may
use its line to provide for the funding needs of various subsidiaries. The agreement also contains financial covenants limiting each borrower's consolidated total debt, including short-term debt, to
no
more than
70 % of its total capitalization. As defined in the line of credit, on
December 31, 2022 , total debt was less than
65 % of total capitalization for each borrower. There were
no
borrowings against this credit facility as of
December 31, 2022 .
Spire utilizes a commercial paper program (“CP Program”) pursuant to which Spire
may
issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts available under the CP Program
may
be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time
not
to exceed $ 1,300.0 . The notes
may
have maturities of up to
365
days from date of issue.
In
March 2021,
Spire Missouri entered into a loan agreement with several banks for a $ 250.0 ,
364 -day unsecured term loan with an interest rate based on LIBOR plus
65
basis points. The loan was repaid in
March 2022.
After quarter end, on
January 5, 2023,
Spire Missouri entered into a loan agreement with several banks for a $ 250.0
unsecured term loan due
October 5, 2023.
Interest accrues at either, as selected by the Company, a base rate or an adjusted forward-looking secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). Adjusted SOFR is based on
one - or
three -month term SOFR, as selected by the Company, plus a SOFR adjustment of
0.10 % per annum plus a margin of
0.80 % per annum.
Information about short-term borrowings, including Spire Missouri’s and Spire Alabama’s borrowings from Spire, is presented in the following table. As of
December 31, 2022 , $ 843.4  of Spire’s CP Program borrowings was used to support lending to the Utilities.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The information presented in the following tables categorizes the assets and liabilities in the balance sheets that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition.
The mutual funds included in Level
1
are valued based on exchange-quoted market prices of individual securities.
Derivative instruments included in Level
1
are valued using quoted market prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) or the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Derivative instruments classified in Level
2
include physical commodity derivatives that are valued using broker or dealer quotation services whose prices are derived principally from, or are corroborated by, observable market inputs. Also included in Level
2
are certain derivative instruments that have values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments in active markets. Derivative instruments included in Level
3
are valued using generally unobservable inputs that are based upon the best information available and reflect management’s assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. There were
no
Level
3
balances as of
December 31, 2022 ,
September 30, 2022 , and
December 31, 2021 . The Company’s and the Utilities’ policy is to recognize transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, as of the beginning of the interim reporting period in which circumstances change or events occur to cause the transfer.
The mutual funds are included in “Other Investments” on the Company’s balance sheets and in “Other Property and Investments” on Spire Missouri’s balance sheets. Changes in their recurring valuations are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in the corresponding income statement. Derivative assets and liabilities, including receivables and payables associated with cash margin requirements, are presented net in the balance sheets when a legally enforceable netting agreement exists between the Company, Spire Missouri, or Spire Alabama and the counterparty to a derivative contract.

PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension Plans
Spire and the Utilities maintain pension plans for their employees.
Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have non-contributory, defined benefit, trusteed forms of pension plans covering the majority of their employees. Qualified plan assets are comprised of mutual and commingled funds consisting of U.S. equities with varying strategies, global equities, alternative investments, and fixed income investments.
The net periodic pension cost includes components shown in the following tables. The components other than the service costs and regulatory adjustment are presented in “Other Income, Net” in the income statement, except for Spire Alabama’s losses on lump-sum settlements. Such losses are capitalized in regulatory balances and amortized over the remaining actuarial life of individuals in the plan, and that amortization is presented in “Other Income, Net.”

Table of Contents
Pursuant to the provisions of Spire Missouri’s and Spire Alabama’s pension plans, pension obligations
may
be satisfied by monthly annuities, lump-sum cash payments, or special termination benefits. Lump-sum payments are recognized as settlements (which can result in gains or losses) only if the total of such payments exceeds the sum of service and interest costs in a specific year. Special termination benefits, when offered, are also recognized as settlements which can result in gains or losses. For the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022 ,
two
Spire Alabama plans met the criteria for settlement recognition. The lump-sum payments recognized as settlements for the remeasurement were $ 27.5  for the Spire Alabama plans. The lump-sum settlement resulted in a loss of $ 8.6  for Spire Alabama. For the remeasurement, the discount rate for both of the Spire Alabama plans was updated to
5.6 %, from
5.7 % for
one
plan and
5.65 % for the other plan, at
September 30, 2022.  The Spire Alabama regulatory tariff requires that settlement losses be amortized over the remaining actuarial life of the individuals in the plan — in this case,
13.4  years for
one
plan and
12.4  years for the other plan. Therefore,
no
lump sum settlement expense was recorded in the quarter ended
December 31, 2022 . For the quarter ended
December 31, 2021,
no
plans met the criteria for settlement recognition.
Effective
December 23, 2021,
the pension cost for Spire Missouri’s western territory (Missouri West) included in customer rates was reduced from $ 5.5
to $ 4.4
per year, the pension cost included in Spire Missouri’s eastern territory (Missouri East) customer rates was increased from $ 29.0
to $ 32.4
per year. The difference between these amounts and pension expense as calculated pursuant to the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.
Also effective
December 23, 2021,
Missouri East prepaid pension assets and other postretirement benefits that were previously being included in rates at $ 21.6
per year for
eight
years were reduced to $ 11.0
per year, with the amortization period being reset for another
eight
years. Missouri West net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits that were previously reducing rates by $ 3.3
per year for
eight
years were reduced to a $ 1.1
reduction in rates per year, with the amortization period being reset for another
eight
years.
The funding policy of the Utilities is to contribute an amount
not
less than the minimum required by government funding standards, nor more than the maximum deductible amount for federal income tax purposes. Fiscal
2023
contributions to Spire Missouri’s pension plans through
December 31, 2022
were $ 16.7  to the qualified trusts and
none
to non-qualified plans. Fiscal
2023
contributions to the Spire Alabama pension plans through
December 31, 2022  were $ 0.8 . Contributions to the qualified trusts of Spire Missouri’s pension plans for the remainder of fiscal
2023
are anticipated to be $ 27.8 . Contributions to Spire Alabama’s pension plans for the remainder of fiscal
2023  are anticipated to be $ 13.0 .

Table of Contents
Other Postretirement Benefits
Spire and the Utilities provide certain life insurance benefits at retirement. Spire Missouri plans provide for medical insurance after early retirement until age
65.
For retirements prior to
January 1, 2015,
certain Spire Missouri plans provided medical insurance after retirement until death. The Spire Alabama plans provide medical insurance upon retirement until death for certain retirees depending on the type of employee and the date the employee was originally hired.
The net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes components shown in the following tables. The components other than the service costs and regulatory adjustment are presented in “Other Income, Net” in the income statement, except in the event Spire Alabama incurs losses on lump-sum settlements. Any such losses are capitalized in regulatory balances and amortized over the remaining actuarial life of individuals in the plan, and that amortization is presented in “Other Income, Net.”

Missouri and Alabama state laws provide for the recovery in rates of costs accrued pursuant to GAAP provided that such costs are funded through an independent, external funding mechanism. The Utilities have established Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) and Rabbi Trusts as external funding mechanisms. The assets of the VEBA and Rabbi Trusts consist primarily of money market securities and mutual funds invested in stocks and bonds.
Effective
December 23, 2021,
the $ 8.6
allowance for recovery in rates for Spire Missouri’s postretirement benefit plans was discontinued. The difference between
no
recovery in rates and pension expense as calculated pursuant to the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.
The Utilities’ funding policy is to contribute amounts to the trusts equal to the periodic benefit cost calculated pursuant to GAAP as recovered in rates. There have been
no  contributions to the postretirement plans through
December 31, 2022
for Spire Missouri or Spire Alabama, and
none
are expected to be required for the remainder of the fiscal year.

INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENT
The Company has
three
reportable segments: Gas Utility, Gas Marketing, and Midstream. The Gas Utility segment is the aggregation of the operations of the Utilities. The Gas Marketing segment includes the results of Spire Marketing, a subsidiary engaged in the non-regulated marketing of natural gas and related activities, including utilizing natural gas storage contracts for providing natural gas sales. The Midstream segment includes Spire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire providing interstate natural gas pipeline transportation services, and Spire Storage, a subsidiary of Spire providing interstate natural gas storage services. Other components of the Company’s consolidated information include Spire's subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline and risk management, among other activities, and unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs.
Accounting policies are described in
Note
1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intersegment transactions include sales of natural gas from Spire Marketing to Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire Storage, sales of natural gas from Spire Missouri to Spire Marketing, propane transportation services provided by Spire NGL Inc. to Spire Missouri, and natural gas transportation services provided by Spire STL Pipeline to Spire Missouri.
Management evaluates the performance of the operating segments based on the computation of net economic earnings. Net economic earnings exclude from reported net income the after-tax impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of impairments and other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative, or GAAP standard-setting actions.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
The Company and the Utilities have entered into contracts with various counterparties, expiring on dates through calendar
2039,
for the storage, transportation, and supply of natural gas. Minimum payments required under the contracts in place at
December 31, 2022 , are estimated at $ 1,445.0 , $ 1,027.3 , and $ 244.6  for the Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama, respectively. Additional contracts are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season of
November
through
April.
The Utilities recover their costs from customers in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders.
A consolidated subsidiary of Spire is a limited partner in an unconsolidated partnership focusing on sustainability initiatives largely tied to the natural gas utility sector. Spire committed to contribute a total of $ 10.0
of capital to the partnership as and when requested by the general partner. As of
December 31, 2022 , Spire has contributed $ 1.9 .
Contingencies
The Company and the Utilities account for contingencies, including environmental liabilities, in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance of ASC Topic
450,
Contingencies , when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
In addition to matters noted below, the Company and the Utilities are involved in other litigation, claims, and investigations arising in the normal course of business. Management, after discussion with counsel, believes the final outcome will
not
have a material effect on the statements of income, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows of the Company, Spire Missouri, or Spire Alabama. However, there is uncertainty in the valuation of pending claims and prediction of litigation results.
The Company and the Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have
not
materially affected the Company’s or Utilities’ financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, the Company or the Utilities
may
incur additional environmental liabilities that
may
result in additional costs, which
may
be material.
43
Table of Contents
In the natural gas industry, many gas distribution companies have incurred environmental liabilities associated with sites they or their predecessor companies formerly owned or operated where manufactured gas operations took place. The Utilities each have former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations in their respective service territories, some of which are discussed under the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama headings below. To the extent costs are incurred associated with environmental remediation activities, the Utilities would request authority from their respective regulators to defer such costs (less any amounts received from insurance proceeds or as contributions from other potentially responsible parties (PRPs)) and collect them through future rates.
To date, costs incurred for all Spire MGP sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring have
not
been material. However, the amount of costs relative to future remedial actions at these and other sites is unknown and
may
be material. The actual future costs that Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama
may
incur could be materially higher or lower depending upon several factors, including whether remediation will be required, final selection and regulatory approval of any remedial actions, changing technologies and government regulations, the ultimate ability of other PRPs to pay, and any insurance recoveries.
In
2020,
Spire retained an outside consultant to conduct probabilistic cost modeling of its former MGP sites in Missouri and Alabama. The purpose of this analysis was to develop an estimated range of probabilistic future liability for each of their MGP sites. That analysis, completed in
March 2021,
provided a range of demonstrated possible future expenditures to investigate, monitor and remediate the former MGP sites. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have recorded their best estimates of the probable expenditures that relate to these matters. The amount remains immaterial, and Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the Company do
not
expect potential liabilities that
may
arise from remediating these sites to have a material impact on their future financial condition or results of operations.
Spire Missouri
Spire Missouri has identified
three
former MGP sites in the city of St. Louis, Missouri (the “City”) where costs have been incurred and claims have been asserted. Spire Missouri has enrolled
two
of the sites in the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) Brownfields/Voluntary Cleanup Program (BVCP). The
third
site is the result of an assertion by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
In conjunction with redevelopment of the Carondelet Coke site, Spire Missouri and another former owner of the site entered into an agreement (the “Remediation Agreement”) with the City development agencies, the developer, and an environmental consultant that obligates
one
of the City agencies and the environmental consultant to remediate the site and obtain a
No
Further Action (NFA) letter from the MoDNR. The Remediation Agreement also provides for a release of Spire Missouri and the other former site owner from certain liabilities related to the past and current environmental condition of the site and requires the developer and the environmental consultant to maintain certain insurance coverage, including remediation cost containment, premises pollution liability, and professional liability. The operative provisions of the Remediation Agreement were triggered on
December 20, 2010,
on which date Spire Missouri and the other former site owner, as full consideration under the Remediation Agreement, paid a small percentage of the cost of remediation of the site. The property was divided into
seven
parcels, and MoDNR NFA letters have been received for
six
of the parcels. Remediation is ongoing on the last parcel.
In a letter dated
June  29,   2011,
the Attorney General for the State of Missouri informed Spire Missouri that the MoDNR had completed an investigation of the
second
site, Station A. The Attorney General requested that Spire Missouri participate in the follow up investigations of the site. In a letter dated
January 10, 2012,
Spire Missouri stated that it would participate in future environmental response activities at the site in conjunction with other PRPs. Accordingly, Spire Missouri entered into a cost sharing agreement for remedial investigation with other PRPs. MoDNR never approved the agreement, so
no
remedial investigation took place.
Additionally, in correspondence dated
November 30, 2016,
Region
7
of the EPA has asserted that Spire Missouri is liable under Section
107 (a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of
1980
(CERCLA) for alleged coal gas waste contamination at a
third
site, Station B. Spire Missouri and the site owner notified the EPA that information and data provided by the EPA to date does
not
rise to the level of documenting a threat to the public health or environment. As such, in
March 2017
Spire Missouri requested more information from the EPA. Spire Missouri never received a response from the EPA.
Spire Missouri has notified its insurers that it seeks reimbursement for costs incurred in the past and future potential liabilities associated with these MGP sites. While some of the insurers have denied coverage and reserved their rights, Spire Missouri retains the right to seek potential reimbursements from them.
44
Table of Contents
On
March 10, 2015,
Spire Missouri received a Section
104 (e) information request under CERCLA from EPA Region
7
regarding the former Thompson Chemical/Superior Solvents site in the City. In turn, Spire Missouri issued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the EPA on
April 3, 2015,
to identify the basis of the inquiry. The FOIA response from the EPA was received on
July 15, 2015,
and a response was provided to the EPA on
August 15, 2015.
Spire Missouri has received
no
further inquiry from the EPA regarding this matter.
In its western service area, Spire Missouri has
six
owned MGP sites enrolled in the BVCP, including Joplin MGP
#1,
St. Joseph MGP
#1,
Kansas City Coal Gas Station B, Kansas City Station A Railroad area, Kansas City Coal Gas Station A, and Independence MGP

Source removal has been conducted at all the owned sites since
2003
with the exception of Joplin. On
September 15, 2016,
a request was made with the MoDNR for a restrictive covenant use limitation with respect to Joplin. Remediation efforts at the
six
sites are at various stages of completion, ranging from groundwater monitoring and sampling following source removal activities to the aforementioned request for the Joplin site. As part of its participation in the BVCP, Spire Missouri communicates regularly with the MoDNR with respect to its remediation efforts and monitoring activities at these sites. On
May 11, 2015,
MoDNR approved the next phase of investigation at the Kansas City Station A Railroad area.
Spire Alabama
Spire Alabama is in the chain of title of
nine
former MGP sites,
four
of which it still owns, and
five
former manufactured gas distribution sites,
one
of which it still owns. All are located in the state of Alabama.
In
2011,
a removal action was completed and an NFA letter was received at the Huntsville MGP site pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent among the EPA, Spire Alabama and the current site owner.
In
2012,
Spire Alabama responded to an EPA Request for Information Pursuant to Section
104
of CERCLA relating to the
35th
Avenue Superfund Site located in North Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama. Spire Alabama was identified as a PRP under CERCLA for the cleanup of the site or costs the EPA incurs in cleaning up the site. At this point, Spire Alabama has
not
been provided information that would allow it to determine the extent, if any, of its potential liability with respect to the
35th
Avenue Superfund Site and vigorously denies its inclusion as a PRP.
Assessments were performed by the EPA of the former MGP sites in Gadsden and Anniston, and NFA letters were received after each assessment.
Spire
In addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is aware of the following contingent matters.
Spire Marketing, along with many natural gas industry participants, faced the unprecedented effects of Winter Storm Uri in
February 2021.
Numerous natural gas producers and midstream operators were unable to deliver natural gas to market as they experienced wellhead freeze-offs, power outages and equipment failure due to the extreme weather. These events resulted in supply curtailments, and related notices of force majeure to excuse performance, from and to certain counterparties. Further, these events have made Spire Marketing subject to various commercial disputes (including regarding force majeure). As such, Spire Marketing has recorded an estimate of potential liabilities for damages based on communications with counterparties and the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction. These estimates are adjusted as new facts emerge or settlement agreements are reached, and it is possible that final settlement amounts
may
materially differ from the current estimate.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Spire Missouri’s and Spire Alabama’s Condensed Financial Statements, and the notes thereto.
OVERVIEW
Certain information is presented by reportable segment, as described below. Effective during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company changed its reportable segments to reflect changes in the way its chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of its operations, develops strategy and allocates capital resources. Specifically, Midstream, which was formerly included in Other is now reported separately. The Company's historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation.
The Company has three reportable segments: Gas Utility, Gas Marketing, and Midstream. Nearly all of Spire’s earnings are derived from its Gas Utility segment, which reflects the regulated activities of the Utilities. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities’ business and the volumetric Spire Missouri rate design, earnings of Spire and each of the Utilities are typically concentrated during the heating season of November through April each fiscal year.
Gas Utility – Spire Missouri
Spire Missouri is Missouri’s largest natural gas distribution utility and is regulated by the MoPSC. Spire Missouri serves St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas throughout the state. Spire Missouri purchases natural gas in the wholesale market from producers and marketers and ships the gas through interstate pipelines into its own distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Spire Missouri also transports gas through its distribution system for certain larger customers who buy their own gas on the wholesale market. Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the MoPSC. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy.
Gas Utility – Spire Alabama
Spire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama and is regulated by the APSC. Spire Alabama’s service territory is located in central and northern Alabama. Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial, and industrial customers, and other end users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also transports gas through its distribution system for certain large commercial and industrial customers for a transportation fee. Effective December 1, 2020, for most of these transportation service customers, Spire Alabama also purchases gas on the wholesale market for sale to the customer upon delivery to the Spire Alabama distribution system. All Spire Alabama services are provided to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the APSC.
Gas Utility – Spire EnergySouth
Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 100,000 customers in southern Alabama and south-central Mississippi. Spire Gulf is regulated by the APSC, and Spire Mississippi is regulated by the MSPSC.
47
Table of Contents
Gas Marketing
Spire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis and is reported in the Gas Marketing segment. Spire Marketing markets natural gas to customers across the U.S. (and into Canada), including customers inside and outside of the Utilities’ service areas. It holds firm transportation and storage contracts in order to effectively manage its transactions with counterparties, which primarily include producers, municipalities, electric and gas utility companies, and large commercial and industrial customers.
Midstream
Spire's midstream operations consist of Spire STL Pipeline LLC (“Spire STL Pipeline”) and Spire Storage West LLC (“Spire Storage”). Spire STL Pipeline is a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire which owns and operates a FERC-regulated 65-mile pipeline connecting the Rockies Express Pipeline in Scott County, Illinois, to delivery points in St. Louis County, Missouri, including Spire Missouri’s storage facility. Spire STL Pipeline’s operating revenue is derived primarily from Spire Missouri as its foundation shipper. Spire Storage is engaged in the storage of natural gas in the western region of the United States. The facility consists of two storage fields operating under one FERC market-based rate tariff.
Other
Other components of the Company’s consolidated information include Spire’s subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline and risk management, among other activities, and unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Net income, earnings per share and operating income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also provide the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings, net economic earnings per share and contribution margin. Management and the Board of Directors use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting, to determine incentive compensation and to evaluate financial performance. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, the related GAAP measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.
Net Economic Earnings and Net Economic Earnings Per Share
Net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income the impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, the largely non-cash impacts of impairments, and other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions. In addition, net economic earnings per share would exclude the impact, in the fiscal year of issuance, of any shares issued to finance such activities that have yet to be included in net economic earnings.
48
Table of Contents
The fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following:
•
Net unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources:
1)
changes in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement; and
2)
ineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments;
•
Lower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the net realizable value of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged; and
•
Realized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity.
These adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. Management believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate all of its businesses, the net effect of these fair value and timing adjustments on the Utilities’ earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation.
Contribution Margin
In addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, have no direct effect on operating income. Therefore, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure, along with the remaining operating expenses, for assessing the Company’s and the Utilities’ performance.

THREE MONTHS ENDED
December 31, 2022
This section contains discussion and analysis of the results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the results for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Overview
The Company reported net income growth of $35.3 and net economic earnings growth of $22.5, reflecting strong results for the Gas Marketing segment and solid growth in the Midstream segment, offset in part by lower earnings at the Gas Utility segment.

Table of Contents
Spire Missouri initiated a rate case in April 2022 to address ongoing issues from the 2021 rate case, particularly the treatment of deferred overhead costs. All parties reached a Full Unanimous Stipulation and Agreement to resolve all issues in the case, which was filed with the MoPSC on November 4, 2022. On November 18, 2022, the Stipulation was approved, including authorization of $78.0 in new base rate revenue and recovery of deferred overheads. New base rates became effective on December 26, 2022. Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf submitted their annual RSE rate filings with the APSC in October 2022, and following regulatory review, adjusted rates became effective January 1, 2023.
In the Midstream segment, the FERC, after conducting a review over the last 18 months following the DC Circuit court remand, reissued a permanent Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Spire STL Pipeline, although the FERC order granting that permanent certificate is subject to rehearing or potential appeal. At Spire Storage, expansion plans remain on track and on budget as the construction season came to a close during the quarter.
The following sections present and discuss the financial metrics in total and by registrant and segment.

The increase in interest expense reflects the significant increase in short-term interest rates and higher debt levels versus the prior year. Current year weighted-average short-term debt increased over $260, driven by higher gas costs, and weighted-average short-term interest rates were 4.4% in the current-year quarter, versus 0.4% in the prior-year quarter.
The change in other income was primarily the result of the Non-Service Cost Postretirement Benefit Transfer (“NSC Transfer”) of $2.0. Removing this impact, other income increased $0.6, primarily the result of inventory carrying cost revenue and slightly favorable mark-to-market valuations on unqualified retirement trusts at Spire Missouri.
The change in income taxes is consistent with the change in pre-tax book income, after removing the $4.1 Spire Missouri regulatory charge that was recorded in the prior year.
Gas Utility
For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, Gas Utility net income was flat with the prior-year quarter as the $3.0 decrease experienced by Spire Alabama was mostly offset by the growth at Spire Missouri. Net economic earnings in the current year was $4.3 lower than the prior year, which tracks the net income trend after removing the Spire Missouri $4.1 GAAP regulatory adjustment in the prior-year quarter. These results are described in further detail below.
The increase in Gas Utility operating revenues was attributable to the following factors:
Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama – Higher PGA/GSA costs (gas cost recovery)
$
175.1
Spire Missouri – 2021 rate order
18.4
Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama – Volumetric usage (net of weather mitigation)

Total Variation
$
229.5
The primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter was $175.1 in higher gas cost recoveries in the current year reflecting the higher average gas costs being passed through to customers, and a $18.4 increase from Spire Missouri resulting from the current-year full quarter impact of the 2021 rate order, versus only one week in the fiscal 2022 first quarter. The current-year quarter also benefited from higher volumetric usage (net of weather mitigation) totaling $22.7 across our entire Utility footprint.

Total Variation
$
29.4
Quarter-over-quarter contribution margin growth was primarily driven by the $18.4 increase from the Spire Missouri 2021 rate increase, Spire Missouri volumetric impacts of $6.6, and $1.4 in adjustments at Spire Alabama, reflecting favorable rate adjustments within the RSE framework.
O&M expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, were $12.6 higher than the prior year. Run-rate expenses increased $14.6 after removing the $2.0 impact of the NSC Transfer. The Gas Utility segment O&M increase reflects approximately $6 due to the change in treatment of Spire Missouri general overheads that were being deferred in the prior-year quarter. The increase also reflects higher non-employee operations expense of $4.9 and higher bad debts expense of $2.6, only partly offset by marginally lower employee-related expenses.
Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $12.9, and were driven by $8.7 in higher pass-through gross receipts taxes, along with higher property taxes resulting from the continued infrastructure build-out by the Utilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the fiscal 2023 first quarter were $5.1 higher than the same period in the prior year primarily driven by continued infrastructure capital expenditures across all the Utilities.
Gas Marketing
Both net income and net economic earnings reflect the strong operating results experienced in the current-year quarter, driven by favorable market conditions that allowed the business to take advantage of regional basis differentials to optimize storage and transportation positions, only slightly offset by higher O&M costs associated with the increased revenues and margin.
Midstream
Net income and net economic earnings for the Company’s Midstream segment increased $1.3 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 versus the prior-year quarter. Of this increase, $1.0 was attributable to Spire Storage, reflecting optimized operational and withdrawal commitments. Spire STL Pipeline results, which were slightly favorable to prior year, accounted for the remaining $0.3 growth. The $2.3 increase in revenues and contribution margin reflect the previously mentioned asset optimization at Spire Storage. Operating expenses across the segment were flat versus the prior-year quarter.
Other
The Company’s other activities generated a $7.3 loss in the quarter ended December 31, 2022, in line with the $7.6 loss recorded in the prior year corresponding quarter.

Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $193.3 higher than the prior-year quarter. A key driver was an increase in gas recovery costs totaling $159.9. Further, $18.4 of the increase was attributable to fiscal 2023 results including the 2021 rate order impact for the entire quarter, versus only one week in the fiscal 2022 quarter. Higher gross receipts taxes contributed a $7.2 increase, while volume/gas usage (including weather mitigation) accounted for $6.6 of the revenue increase in the current-year quarter.
Contribution margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $25.7 from the same period in the prior year, largely the result of the previously mentioned timing of the 2021 rate case implementation generating $18.4 incremental contribution, combined with favorable volumetric impacts of $6.6.
Reported O&M expenses for the first quarter increased $10.8 versus the prior year. Run-rate expenses increased $12.7 after removing the $1.9 impact of the NSC Transfer. The increase was largely due to $6.0 of general overheads that were previously deferred and were not reflected in rates collected during the current-year quarter. The increase also reflects higher non-employee operations expense of $5.0 and higher bad debts expense of $1.6, only partly offset by $0.8 lower employee-related expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $4.4 versus the prior-year quarter due to ongoing capital investments. Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $10.7, driven by the higher pass-through gross receipts taxes of $7.2, combined with higher property taxes resulting from the continued infrastructure build-out.
Other income was higher by $1.0, after removing the $1.9 expense due to the NSC Transfer, with the remaining variance primarily attributable to increased inventory carrying cost revenue and slightly favorable mark-to-market valuations on unqualified retirement trusts. Interest expense increased $7.5, primarily reflecting higher short-term interest rates in the current year.
Resulting net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, represents a $2.0 increase in results versus the prior-year quarter.
Degree days in Spire Missouri’s service areas during the three months ended

Operating revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $25.8 from the same period in the prior year. The change in operating revenue was principally due to $15.2 higher gas recovery costs, a $5.7 increase attributable to favorable weather/usage impacts, an increase in off-system sales totaling $2.0, and net favorable regulatory adjustments of $1.5 under the RSE framework.
Contribution margin was $0.8 higher versus the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by $1.4 favorable net rate adjustments under the RSE mechanism, slightly offset by weather/usage variance after weather mitigation.
O&M expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $0.6 versus the prior-year quarter, with no NSC Transfer impact variance versus the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to higher bad debts expense of $0.7 and higher non-employee operating expenses of $0.3, only partly offset by $0.4 employee-related expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expenses were up $0.5, the result of continued investment in infrastructure upgrades. Interest expense for the current quarter increased $3.2 versus the prior-year quarter, the result of significantly higher short-term interest rates and to a lesser extent, higher levels of long-term debt.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, resulting net income decreased $3.0 versus the prior-year quarter.
As measured in degree days, temperatures in Spire Alabama’s service area during the three months ended
December 31, 2022 , were 8.1% warmer than normal and 6.8% warmer than a year ago. Spire Alabama’s total system volume sold and transported were 252.1 million CCF for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 , compared with 252.8 million CCF for the same period in the prior year. Total off-system volume sold and transported were 14.6 million CCF for the quarter, compared with 0.1 million CCF a year ago.

Table of Contents
For the
three months ended December 31, 2022 , net cash from operating activities improved $59.1 from the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. The key drivers to the favorable change are the $35.3 increase in net income (discussed above), coupled with changes related to regulatory timing and fluctuation in working capital items (as discussed below in the Future Cash Requirements section).
For the
three months ended December 31, 2022 , net cash used in investing activities was $8.6 greater than for the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of a $9.1 increase in capital expenditures. The drivers of the higher capital expenditures were a $5.1 spending increase in the Utilities, and a $5.0 increase for Spire Storage, partially offset by a $2.1 spending decline at Spire STL Pipeline.
Lastly, for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 , net cash provided by financing activities was down $55.9 versus net cash provided for the
three months ended December 31, 2021 . Current year long-term debt issuances were $205.0, or $95.0 lower than a year ago, while repayments of long-term debt in the current period declined $24.6 compared to the prior year first quarter. In addition, net short-term borrowings were $189.5 in fiscal year 2023, compared with net borrowings totaling $174.0 a year ago, or an increase of $15.5.
Future Cash Requirements
The Company’s short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri’s use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities’ PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Company’s cash provided by or used in operating activities.
Spire’s material cash requirements as of
December 31, 2022 , are related to capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on long-term debt, natural gas purchase obligations, and dividends. Except for Spire Alabama's and Spire Gulf's October 2022 issuance of a total of $205.0 of fixed-rate debt due in October of 2029, 2032, and 2037, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the future cash requirements discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2022 . Total Company capital expenditures are planned to be $700 for fiscal 2023.
Source of Funds
It is management’s view that the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated requirements. Their debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Corporation (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”). As of December 31, 2022, the debt ratings of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama (shown in the following table) remain at investment grade with a stable outlook (other than Moody’s negative outlook for Spire Missouri debt).

Note 5
of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 1.
Long-term Debt and Equity
At
December 31, 2022 , including the current portion but excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, Spire had long-term debt totaling $3,432.7, of which $1,648.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, $750.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and $229.7 was issued by other subsidiaries. For information about long-term debt issued this fiscal year, see
Note 5
of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 1.
Effective March 5, 2022, Spire Missouri was authorized by the MoPSC to issue conventional term loans, first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt, preferred stock and common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $800.0 for financings placed any time before December 31, 2024. Under this authorization through January 2023, Spire Missouri has issued $40.4 of common stock and a $250.0 term loan.  Spire Alabama has no standing authority to issue long-term debt and must petition the APSC for each planned issuance.
Spire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 152,835 and 147,763  shares at
December 31, 2022
and January 27, 2023, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire and Spire Missouri also have a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of various equity and debt securities, which expires on May 9, 2025.
On February 6, 2019, Spire entered into an “at-the-market” (ATM) equity distribution agreement, supplemented as of May 14, 2019, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock pursuant to Spire’s previous universal shelf registration statement and a prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2019. Under this program, a total of 626,249 shares with an aggregate offering price of $47.8 were issued in fiscal 2019 and 2020, and 354,000 shares with an aggregate offering price of $23.5 were issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. On April 28, 2022, Spire’s board approved a new authorization for the sale of additional shares with an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 before the expiration of the new universal shelf registration statement referenced in the paragraph above and a prospectus supplement dated May 9, 2022, under which a total of 365,625 shares with an aggregate offering price of $27.7 were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
Including the current portion of long-term debt, the Company’s long-term consolidated capitalization consisted of 46% equity at both  December 31, 2022
and  September 30, 2022 .
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Utilities and other Spire subsidiaries own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company’s, Spire Missouri’s, or Spire Alabama’s financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations change, however, the Company and the Utilities may be required to incur additional costs. For information relative to environmental matters, see Contingencies in
Note 10
of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 1.
REGULATORY MATTERS

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have evaluated or are in the process of evaluating the effects that recently issued accounting standards will have on the companies’ financial position or results of operations upon adoption, but none are currently expected to have a significant impact.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Item 7 of Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama’s combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and include regulatory accounting, employee benefits and postretirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, and income taxes. There were no significant changes to critical accounting estimates during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
