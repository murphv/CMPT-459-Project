(“Coherent”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation for the periods presented have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K dated August 29, 2022. The condensed consolidated results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet information as of June 30, 2022 was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements. The Company is closely monitoring the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related factors on all aspects of our business, including the impact to our employees, suppliers and customers, as well as the impact to our supply chain and the countries and markets in which Coherent operates. In particular, the Company is continuing to focus intensely on mitigating any resulting adverse impacts on our foreign and domestic operations, starting by prioritizing the safety of our employees, suppliers and customers. Note 2.     Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting In March 2020, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedients to ease the potential burden of accounting for the effects of reference rate reform as it pertains to contract modifications of debt and lease contracts and derivative contracts identified in a hedging relationship. These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, to extend the temporary accounting rules under Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements relative to our floating rate debt, our interest rate swap and our interest rate cap. Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”), which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date. We have adopted this accounting standard as of July 1, 2022. The acquisition of Coherent, Inc. has been accounted for in accordance with ASU 2021-08, as will any future acquisitions. Results of operations for quarterly periods prior to adoption remain unchanged as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2021-08. Refer to Note 3. Coherent Acquisition for further information. Note 3.      Coherent Acquisition On July 1, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of Coherent, Inc. (the “Merger”), a global provider of lasers and laser-based technology for scientific, commercial, and industrial customers, in a combined cash and stock transaction in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 25, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth therein, each share of common stock of legacy Coherent, Inc. (“Legacy Coherent”), par value $ 0.01
per share (the “Legacy Coherent Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to July 1, 2022, was canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive $ 220.00
in cash and
0.91
of a share of Coherent's common stock,
no
par value (“Coherent Common Stock”).
Following the completion of the Legacy Coherent acquisition, the Company announced a new brand identity, including a corporate name change to Coherent Corp. (Nasdaq: COHR) on September 8, 2022. 11 On the Closing Date, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company, the lenders, and other parties thereto, and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, which provides for senior secured financing of $ 4.0
billion, consisting of a new term loan A credit facility (the “Term A Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $ 850  million a new term loan B credit facility (the “Term B Facility”) (and, together with the Term A Facility, the “Term Facilities”) in an aggregate principal amount of $ 2.8
billion, and a new revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate available amount of $ 350
million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $ 50
million. For additional information on the credit facility refer to Note 8. Debt. In order to complete the funding of the Merger, the Company had a net cash outflow of $ 2.1  billion on July 1, 2022. The Company recorded $ 10  million and $ 72  million of acquisition related costs in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, representing professional and other direct acquisition costs. These costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss). Approximately
23  million shares of Coherent Common Stock in the aggregate were issued in conjunction with the closing of the Merger. Total preliminary Merger consideration was $ 7.1  billion, including replacement equity awards attributable to pre-combination service for certain Legacy Coherent restricted stock units. The preliminary total fair value of consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of Coherent, Inc. consisted of the following (in $000): Shares Per Share Total Consideration Cash paid for merger consideration — — $ 5,460,808   Shares of COHR common stock issued to Legacy Coherent stockholders 22,587,885 $ 49.83 1,125,554   Converted Legacy Coherent RSUs attributable to pre-combination service — — 82,037   Payment of Legacy Coherent debt — — 364,544   Payment of Legacy Coherent transaction expenses — — 62,840   $ 7,095,783   The Company allocated the fair value of the preliminary purchase price consideration to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, generally based on estimated fair values. The excess preliminary purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. Our valuation assumptions of acquired assets and assumed liabilities require significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets, inventories, property, plant & equipment and deferred income taxes. In determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company must make assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business, including among other things, the forecasted revenue growth attributable to the asset group and projected operating expenses inclusive of expected synergies, future cost savings, and other benefits expected to be achieved by combining the Company and Legacy Coherent. The Company’s intangible assets are comprised of trade names and trademarks, customer relationships, developed technology and backlog. The Company utilized widely accepted income-based, market-based, and cost-based valuation approaches to perform the preliminary purchase price allocation. The estimated fair value of the customer relationships and backlog are determined using the multi-period excess earnings method and the estimated fair value of the trade names and trademarks and developed technology are determined using the relief from royalty method. Both methods require forward looking estimates that are discounted to determine the fair value of the intangible asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate that is reflective of the level of risk associated with future estimates associated with the asset group that could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
The purchase price allocation set forth is preliminary and will be revised as third party valuations are finalized or additional information becomes available during the measurement period, which could be up to 12 months from the Closing Date. Any such revisions or changes may be material. We expect to finalize pushdown accounting as soon as practicable, but no later than twelve months from the Closing Date. 12 Our preliminary allocation of the purchase price of Legacy Coherent, based on the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Closing Date, is as follows (in $000): Preliminary Allocation as of 7/1/2022 Previously Reported September 30, 2022 Measurement Period Adjustments (i) As Adjusted (preliminary) Assets Current Assets Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 393,324   $ —  $ 393,324   Accounts receivable 270,928   —  270,928   Inventories (ii) 497,345   66,581   563,926   Prepaid and refundable income taxes (iii) 8,869   ( 1,592 ) 7,277   Prepaid and other current assets 41,467   —  41,467   Total Current Assets 1,211,933   64,989   1,276,922   Property, plant & equipment, net (iv) 424,228   16,704   440,932   Deferred income taxes (iii) 1,115   ( 793 ) 322   Other assets 102,726   —  102,726   Other intangible assets, net (v) 2,425,454   1,079,546   3,505,000   Goodwill 4,005,727   ( 910,633 ) 3,095,094   Total Assets $ 8,171,183   $ 249,813   $ 8,420,996   Liabilities Current Liabilities Current portion of long-term debt $ 4,504   $ —  $ 4,504   Accounts payable 116,754   —  116,754   Accrued compensation and benefits 60,596   —  60,596   Operating lease current liabilities 13,002   —  13,002   Accrued income taxes payable 16,936   —  16,936   Other accrued liabilities (vi) 136,042   702   136,744   Total Current Liabilities 347,834   702   348,536   Long-term debt 22,991   —  22,991   Deferred income taxes (iii) 563,824   249,674   813,498   Operating lease liabilities 43,313   —  43,313   Other liabilities (vi) 97,438   ( 563 ) 96,875   Total Liabilities $ 1,075,400   $ 249,813   $ 1,325,213   Preliminary aggregate acquisition consideration $ 7,095,783   $ —  $ 7,095,783   (i) The Company recorded measurement period adjustments to its preliminary acquisition date fair values due to the refinement of its valuation models, assumptions and inputs. The following measurement period adjustments were based upon information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized at that date. (ii) The condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to record Legacy Coherent’s inventories at a preliminary fair value of approximately $ 564  million, an increase of $ 67
million from the preliminary fair value reported at September 30, 2022 with a corresponding decrease to goodwill. The Condensed Combined Statement of Earnings (Loss) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 includes cost of goods sold of approximately $ 112
million and $ 158
million, respectively, related to the increased basis in the preliminary fair value compared to the carrying value. The $ 112
million cost of goods sold recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2022 includes an increase of $ 33
million due to the measurement period adjustment which relates to a previous reporting period. The costs are being amortized over the expected period during which the acquired inventory is sold, the six months ended December 31, 2022, and thus are not anticipated to affect the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) beyond twelve months after the Closing Date. 13 (iii) The Company has adjusted its prepaid and refundable income taxes, deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability positions as of December 31, 2022, to $ 7  million, $ 0 million
and $ 813  million, respectively, as a result of measurement period adjustments. (iv) The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet has been adjusted to record Legacy Coherent’s property, plant and equipment (consisting of land, buildings and improvements, equipment, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements) at a preliminary fair value of approximately $ 441  million, an increase of $ 17
million from the preliminary fair value reported at September 30, 2022 with a corresponding decrease to goodwill. The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) have been adjusted to recognize additional depreciation expense related to the increased basis. The additional depreciation expense is computed with the assumption that the various categories of assets will be depreciated over their remaining useful lives on a straight-line basis. (v) Preliminary identifiable intangible assets in the condensed combined balance sheet increased $ 1.1  billion from the preliminary fair value reported at September 30, 2022 with a corresponding decrease to goodwill. Intangibles amortization recorded in cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 6
million and $ 43
million, respectively, and included a reduction in the current quarter of $ 16
million due to the measurement period adjustment which relates to a previous reporting period. Intangibles amortization recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 80
million and $ 105
million, respectively, and included an increase in the current quarter of $ 27
million due to the measurement period adjustment which relates to a previous reporting period. Preliminary identifiable intangible assets consist of the following and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) (in $000): Preliminary
Fair Value Estimated Useful Life Trade names and trademarks $ 430,000   N/A Customer relationships 1,830,000   15
years Developed technology 1,157,500   13.5
years Backlog 87,500   1.0
year Intangible assets acquired $ 3,505,000   (vi) The Company recorded approximately $ 1  million of increases in other current liabilities and $ 1  million of decreases in other liabilities as measurement period adjustments. Operating results, including goodwill and intangibles, of Legacy Coherent are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the Closing Date, within the Lasers segment. Revenues and net loss for the Lasers segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $ 379  million and $ 171  million, respectively. Revenues and net loss for the Lasers segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $ 772  million and $ 299
million, respectively. Goodwill in the amount of $ 3.1  billion arising from the acquisition is attributed to the expected synergies, including future cost savings, and other benefits expected to be generated by combining Coherent and Legacy Coherent. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

1.3 % Term Loan due 2024, (ii)
1.0 % State of Connecticut Term Loan due 2023, and (iii) Facility construction loan in Germany due 2030. For the Facility construction loan, on December 21, 2020, Coherent LaserSystems GmbH & Co. KG entered into a loan agreement with Commerzbank for borrowings of up to
24  million Euros, which were drawn down by October 29, 2021, to finance a portion of the construction of a new facility in Germany. The term of the loan is
10
years, and borrowings bear interest at
1.55 % per annum. Payments are made quarterly.

The Indenture contains customary covenants and events of default, including default relating to among other things, payment default, failure to comply with covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or the Senior Notes and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Indenture. 0.25 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 In August 2017, the Company issued and sold $ 345
million aggregate principal amount of its
0.25 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “Convertible Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Beginning on June 1, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”), holders were able to convert their Convertible Notes at any time. For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022, the holders of the Convertible Notes converted $ 332  million of principal, which was recorded as current portion of long-term debt at June 30, 2022, and received approximately
7  million shares of Coherent Common Stock in settlement of the conversions.
On the Maturity Date, $ 4  million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes remained outstanding, and was repaid in cash, and the Convertible Notes are no longer outstanding. At the Maturity Date, the accrued interest on the Coherent Convertible Notes was immaterial. The total interest expense related to the Convertible Notes was immaterial for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Aggregate Availability The Company had aggregate availability of $ 350
million under its Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022. Note 9.     Income Taxes The Company’s year-to-date effective income tax rate at December 31, 2022 was
29 % compared to an effective tax rate of
16 % for the same period in 2021. The variations between the Company’s effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of
21 % were due to nondeductible expenses and tax rate differentials between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. 20 U.S. GAAP prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements which includes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company’s gross unrecognized income tax benefit, excluding interest and penalties, was $ 71
million and $ 37
million, respectively. The Company has classified the uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities, as the amounts are not expected to be paid within one year. If recognized, $ 32
million of the gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 would impact the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss). The amount of accrued interest and penalties included in the gross unrecognized income tax benefit was $ 6  million and $ 3  million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Fiscal years 2019 to 2022 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service, fiscal years 2018 to 2022 remain open to examination by certain state jurisdictions, and fiscal years 2011 to 2022 remain open to examination by certain foreign taxing jurisdictions. The Company is currently under examination for certain subsidiary companies in California for the years ended September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2019; Colorado for the years ended September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2021; Vietnam for the years ended September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2021; India for the year ended March 31, 2016;
Singapore for the year ended September 30, 2020; and Germany for the years ended June 30, 2012 through September 30, 2020. The Company believes its income tax reserves for these tax matters are adequate. Note 10.     Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception for arrangements with an initial term of more than 12 months, and classify it as either finance or operating. Finance leases are generally those that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated useful life. Finance lease assets are recorded in property, plant and equipment, net, and finance lease liabilities within other accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized in operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term, with the interest component for lease liabilities included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Operating leases are recorded in other assets and operating lease liabilities, current and non-current on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in operating expenses over the lease term. The Company’s lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments, over the lease term, using a discount rate of similarly secured borrowings available to the Company. For the purpose of lease liability measurement, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. Any variable payments that depend on an index or rate are expensed as incurred. The Company accounts for non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, as a component of the lease, and includes it in the initial measurement of leased assets and corresponding liabilities. The Company’s lease terms and conditions may include options to extend or terminate. An option is recognized when it is reasonably certain that Coherent will exercise that option. The Company’s lease assets also include any lease payments made and exclude any lease incentives received prior to commencement. Our lease assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets used in operations. 21 The following table presents lease costs, which include leases for arrangements with an initial term of more than 12 months, lease term, and discount rates ($000): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Finance lease cost Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 417   $ 833   Interest on lease liabilities 284   572   Total finance lease cost 701   1,405   Operating lease cost 13,045   26,311   Total lease cost $ 13,746   $ 27,716   Cash Paid for Amounts Included in the Measurement of Lease Liabilities Operating cash flows from finance leases $ 284   $ 572   Operating cash flows from operating leases 12,354   25,052   Financing cash flows from finance leases 346   688   Weighted-Average Remaining Lease Term (in Years) Finance leases 9.0 Operating leases 6.8 Weighted-Average Discount Rate Finance leases 5.6   % Operating leases 5.3   % Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 Finance Lease Cost Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 418   $ 838   Interest on lease liabilities 302   609   Total finance lease cost $ 720   $ 1,447   Operating lease cost 9,176   18,395   Sublease income 143   507   Total lease cost $ 9,753   $ 19,335   Cash Paid for Amounts Included in the Measurement of Lease Liabilities Operating cash flows from finance leases $ 302   $ 609   Operating cash flows from operating leases 8,850   17,665   Financing cash flows from finance leases 312   622   Note 11.     Equity and Redeemable Preferred Stock Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock In July 2020, the Company issued
2.3
million shares of
6.00 % Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred,
no
par value per share (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”). Unless previously converted, each outstanding share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined in the Statement with Respect to Shares establishing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock) into a number of shares of Coherent Common Stock equal to not more than
4.6512
shares and not less than
3.8760
shares (the
“ Minimum Conversion Rate ” ), depending on the applicable market value of the Coherent Common Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments.
22 Other than in the event of one of certain fundamental changes, a holder of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may, at any time prior to July 1, 2023, elect to convert such holder's shares, in whole or in part, at a Minimum Conversion Rate per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. If one of certain fundamental changes occurs on or prior to July 1, 2023, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will have the right to convert their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into shares of Coherent
Common Stock at the conversion rate determined in accordance with the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock during the period beginning on, and including, the effective date of such change and ending on, and including, the date that is
20
calendar days after the effective date of such fundamental change (or, if later, the date that is
20
calendar days after holders receive notice of such fundamental change, but in no event later than July 1, 2023). Holders who convert their shares of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock during that period will also receive a dividend make-whole amount and, to the extent there is any, the accumulated dividend amount, in each case as calculated in accordance with the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company recognized $ 7
million and $ 14
million of preferred stock dividends for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, associated with the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company recognized $ 7  million and $ 14
million of preferred stock dividends for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, associated with the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The preferred dividends were presented as a reduction to retained earnings on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022.
The following table presents dividends per share and dividends recognized for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Dividends per share $ 3.00   $ 3.00   $ 6.00   $ 6.00   Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends ($000) 6,900   6,900   13,800   13,800   Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock In March 2021, the Company issued
75,000
shares of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock,
no
par value per share ("Series B-1 Preferred Stock").
The shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of Coherent Common Stock as follows: • at the election of the holder, at an initial conversion price of $ 85
per share (as it may be adjusted from time to time, the “Conversion Price”) upon the delivery by Coherent to the holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock of an offer to repurchase the Series B-1 Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Statement with Respect to Shares establishing the Series B Preferred Stock as defined below); and • at the election of the Company, any time following March 31, 2024 at the then-applicable Conversion Price if the volume-weighted average price of Coherent Common Stock exceeds
150 % of the then-applicable Conversion Price for
20
trading days out of any
30
consecutive trading days. The issued shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock currently have voting rights, voting as one class with the Coherent Common Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock (as defined below), on an as-converted basis, subject to limited exceptions. On or at any time after March 31, 2031: • each holder has the right to require the Company to redeem all of their Coherent Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, for cash, at a redemption price per share equal to the sum of the Stated Value (as defined in the Statement with Respect to Shares establishing the Series B Preferred Stock) for such shares plus an amount equal to all accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on such shares that had not previously been added to the Stated Value (such price the “Redemption Price,” and such right the “Put Right”); and • the Company has the right to redeem, in whole or in part, on a pro rata basis from all holders based on the aggregate number of shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock outstanding, for cash, at the Redemption Price. 23 In connection with any Fundamental Change (as defined in the Statement with Respect to Shares establishing the Series B Preferred Stock), and subject to the procedures set forth in the Statement with Respect to Shares establishing the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company must, or will cause the survivor of a Fundamental Change to, make an offer to repurchase, at the option and election of the holder thereof, each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock then-outstanding at a purchase price per share in cash equal to (i) the Stated Value for such shares plus an amount equal to all accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on such shares that had not previously been added to the Stated Value as of the date of repurchase plus (ii) if prior to March 31, 2026, the aggregate amount of all dividends that would have been paid (subject to certain exceptions), from the date of repurchase through March 31, 2026. If the Company defaults on a payment obligation with respect to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and such default is not cured within
30
days, the dividend rate will increase to
8 % per annum and will be increased by an additional
2 % per annum each quarter the Company remains in default, not to exceed
14 % per annum.
The Series B-1 Preferred Stock is redeemable for cash outside of the control of the Company upon the exercise of the Put Right, and upon a Fundamental Change, and is therefore classified as mezzanine equity.
The Series B-1 Preferred Stock is initially measured at fair value less issuance costs, accreted to its redemption value over a
10 -year period (using the effective interest method) with such accretion accounted for as deemed dividends and reductions to Net Earnings Available to Common Shareholders.
Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock On July 1, 2022, the Company issued
140,000
shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock,
no
par value per share (“Series B-2 Preferred Stock” and, together with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the “Series B Preferred Stock”).
The shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of Coherent Common Stock as follows: • at the election of the holder the Conversion Price upon the delivery by Coherent to the holders of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock of an offer to repurchase the Coherent Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Statement with Respect to Shares establishing the Series B Preferred Stock); and • at the election of the Company, any time following July 1, 2025 at the then-applicable Conversion Price if the volume-weighted average price of Coherent Common Stock exceeds
150 % of the then-applicable Conversion Price for
20
trading days out of any
30
consecutive trading days. The issued shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock currently have voting rights, voting as one class with the Coherent Common Stock and the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, on an as-converted basis, subject to limited exceptions. On or at any time after July 1, 2032: • each holder has the right to require the Company to redeem all of their Series B-2 Preferred Stock, for cash, at a redemption price per share equal to the sum of the Stated Value for such shares (as defined in the Statement with Respect to Shares establishing the Series B Preferred Stock) plus an amount equal to all accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on such shares that had not previously been added to the Stated Value (such price the “Redemption Price,” and such right the “Put Right”); and • the Company has the right to redeem, in whole or in part, on a pro rata basis from all holders based on the aggregate number of shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock outstanding, for cash, at the Redemption Price. In connection with any Fundamental Change, and subject to the procedures set forth in the Statement with Respect to Shares establishing the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company must, or will cause the survivor of a Fundamental Change to, make an offer to repurchase, at the option and election of the holder thereof, each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock then-outstanding at a purchase price per share in cash equal to (i) the Stated Value for such shares plus an amount equal to all accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on such shares that had not previously been added to the Stated Value as of the date of repurchase plus (ii) if prior to July 1, 2027, the aggregate amount of all dividends that would have been paid (subject to certain exceptions), from the date of repurchase through July 1, 2027. 24 If the Company defaults on a payment obligation with respect to the Series B-2 Preferred Stock and such default is not cured within
30
days, the dividend rate will increase to
8 % per annum and will be increased by an additional
2 % per annum each quarter the Company remains in default, not to exceed
14 % per annum.
The Series B-2 Preferred Stock is redeemable for cash outside of the control of the Company upon the exercise of the Put Right, and upon a Fundamental Change, and is therefore classified as mezzanine equity.
The Series B-2 Preferred Stock is initially measured at fair value less issuance costs, accreted to its redemption value over a
10-year
period (using the effective interest method) with such accretion accounted for as deemed dividends and reductions to Net Earnings Available to Common Shareholders.
The Company recognized $ 29  million and $ 58
million of preferred stock dividends related to the Series B Preferred Stock for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company recognized $ 10
million and $ 20
million of preferred stock dividends related to the Series B Preferred Stock for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The preferred stock dividends were presented as a reduction to retained earnings on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022. The following table presents dividends per share and dividends recognized for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Dividends per share $ 134.83   $ 130.71   $ 268.21   $ 266.47   Dividends ($000) 27,821   9,307   55,298   19,011   Deemed dividends ($000) 1,168   496   2,368   974   Note 12.     Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the diluted earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, as the Company was in a net loss position, no dilution was included in the calculation of earnings (loss) per share. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been anti-dilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, diluted earnings (loss) per share excluded the potentially dilutive effect of the performance and restricted shares, calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period, using the treasury stock method, as well as the shares of Coherent Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible debt, the Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (under the If-Converted method), as their effects were anti-dilutive.

Note 13.     Segment Reporting The Company reports its business segments using the “management approach” model for segment reporting. This means that the Company determines its reportable business segments based on the way the chief operating decision-maker organizes business segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. On July 1, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Legacy Coherent. See Note 3. Coherent Acquisition for further information. The operating results of Legacy Coherent are reflected in the Lasers segment. 26 Table of Contents Effective July 1, 2022, the Company reports its financial results in the following
three
segments: (i) Networking, (ii) Materials, and (iii) Lasers. Previously, financial results had been reported in the following
two
segments: (i) Photonic Solutions and (ii) Compound Semiconductors. The Networking segment represents the former Photonic Solutions segment and the Materials segment represents the former Compound Semiconductors segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker receives and reviews financial information based on these
three
segments. The Company evaluates business segment performance based upon segment operating income, which is defined as earnings before income taxes, interest and other income or expense. The segments are managed separately due to the market, production requirements and facilities unique to each segment. The accounting policies are consistent across each segment. To the extent possible, the Company’s corporate expenses and assets are allocated to the segments. The expenses associated with the Legacy Coherent acquisition for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are wholly allocated to the Lasers segment. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the expenses associated with the acquisition of Legacy Coherent were not allocated to an operating segment, and were presented in Unallocated and Other. In addition, prior year numbers were recast to reflect the transfer of two entities between the Networking and Materials segments.

The Plan was approved by the Company's shareholders at the Annual Meeting in November 2020. The Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, deferred shares, performance shares and performance share units to employees, officers and directors of the Company. The maximum number of shares of Coherent Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan is limited to
9,550,000
shares of Coherent Common Stock, not including any remaining shares forfeited under the predecessor plans that may be rolled into the Plan. The Plan has vesting provisions predicated upon the death, retirement or disability of the grantee.
On the Closing Date, the Company assumed
403,675
Legacy Coherent restricted stock units ("Converted RSUs"). The Converted RSUs are generally subject to the same terms and conditions that applied to the RSUs immediately prior to the Closing Date. Other than the assumed Converted RSUs, Coherent did not assume any other awards outstanding under Legacy Coherent equity incentive plans. On the Closing Date, Coherent assumed the unused capacity under Legacy Coherent equity incentive plan, which totaled

The Company estimates fair value of its financial instruments utilizing an established three-level hierarchy in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date as follows: • Level 1 –Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 –Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments. • Level 3 –Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurements. The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement. The Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $ 1,075
million to limit the exposure to its variable interest rate debt by effectively converting it to a fixed interest rate. The Company receives payments based on the one-month LIBOR and makes payments based on a fixed rate of
1.52 %. The Company receives payments with a floor of
0.00 %. The interest rate swap agreement has an effective date of November 24, 2019, with an expiration date of September 24, 2024. The initial notional amount of the interest rate swap was decreased to $ 825
million in June 2022 and will remain at that amount through the expiration date. The Company designated this instrument as a cash flow hedge and deemed the hedge relationship effective at inception of the contract. The fair value of the interest rate swap of $ 43
million
is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet within prepaid and other current assets and other assets as of December 31, 2022. Changes in fair value are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and reclassified into the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) as interest expense in the period in which the underlying transaction affects earnings. Cash flows from hedging activities are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same classification as the hedged item, generally as a component of cash flows from operations. The fair value of the interest rate swap is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques and reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate swap including the period to maturity, and while there are no quoted prices in active markets, it uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair value analysis also considers a credit valuation adjustment to reflect nonperformance risk of both the Company and the single counterparty. The interest rate swap is classified as a Level 2 item within the fair value hierarchy.
On February 23, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate cap ("the Cap") with an effective date of July 1, 2023. The Cap manages the Company's exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of the Company's floating rate debt. The Cap provides the Company with the right to receive payment if one-month LIBOR exceeds
1.85 %. Beginning in July 2023, the Company will begin to pay a fixed monthly premium based on an annual rate of
0.853 % for the Cap. The Cap will carry a notional amount ranging from $ 500  million to $ 1,500  million. The fair value of the interest rate cap of $ 38
million is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet within other assets as of December 31, 2022. The Cap is designed to mirror the terms of the Credit Agreement as of the effective date, or its direct replacement. The Company designated the Cap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the LIBOR-based interest payments on the Term Loan Facilities. Every period over the life of the hedging relationship, the entire change in fair value related to the hedging instrument will first be recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts accumulated in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into interest expense in the same period or periods in which interest expense is recognized on the Credit Agreement, or its direct replacement. The fair value of the Cap is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques and reflects the contractual terms of the Cap including the period to maturity, and while there are no quoted prices in active markets, it uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The Cap is classified as a Level 2 item within the fair value hierarchy. 29 Table of Contents The Company estimated the fair value of the Senior Notes based on quoted market prices as of the last trading day prior to December 31, 2022; however, the Senior Notes have only a limited trading volume and as such this fair value estimate is not necessarily the value at which the Senior Notes could be retired or transferred. The Company concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 2. The carrying value of the Senior Notes is net of unamortized discount and issuance costs. See Note 8. Debt for details on the Company’s debt facilities.
The fair value and carrying value of the Convertible Notes and Senior Notes were as followed ($000): December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Convertible Notes $ —   $ —   $ 382,601   $ 341,162   Senior Notes $ 857,142   $ 982,692   $ 865,527   $ 982,297   The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are considered Level 1 among the fair value hierarchy and approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments. The Company’s borrowings including its lease obligations and the Senior Notes, are considered Level 2 among the fair value hierarchy and their principal amounts approximate fair value.
The Company, from time to time, purchases foreign currency forward exchange contracts, that permit it to transact specified amounts of these foreign currencies for pre-established U.S. dollar amounts at specified dates that represent assets or liabilities on the balance sheets of certain subsidiaries. These contracts are entered into for the purpose of limiting translational exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and which otherwise would expose the Company's earnings, on the revaluation of its aggregate net assets or liabilities in respective currencies, to foreign currency risk. At December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts recorded at fair value. The fair values of these instruments were measured using valuations based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (Level 2) and are valued by reference to similar financial instruments, adjusted for credit risk and restrictions and other terms specific to the contracts. Realized gains related to these contracts for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were $ 28  million and $ 5  million, respectively, and were included in other expense (income), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss). Note 16.     Share Repurchase Programs In August 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $ 50
million of Coherent Common Stock through a share repurchase program (the “Program”) that calls for shares to be purchased in the open market or in private transactions from time to time. The Program has no expiration and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Shares purchased by the Company are retained as treasury stock and available for general corporate purposes. The Company did
no t repurchase any shares pursuant to this Program during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has cumulatively purchased
1,416,587
shares of Coherent Common Stock pursuant to the Program for approximately $ 22
million. The dollar value of shares as of December 31, 2022 that may yet be purchased under the Program is approximately $ 28
million. Note 17.     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) by component, net of tax, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were as follows ($000): Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Interest Rate Swap Interest Rate Cap Defined Benefit Pension Plan Total Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI - June 30, 2022 $ ( 34,572 ) $ 11,735   $ 14,306   $ 6,364   $ ( 2,167 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 99,664   17,973   15,921   442   134,000   Amounts reclassified from AOCI —   ( 5,703 ) —   —   ( 5,703 ) Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 99,664   12,270   15,921   442   128,297   AOCI - December 31, 2022 $ 65,092   $ 24,005   $ 30,227   $ 6,806   $ 126,130   30 Table of Contents Item 2.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of Coherent’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management.

As we grow, we are focused on scaling our Company and deriving the continued benefits of vertical integration as we strive to be a best in class competitor in all of our highly competitive markets. The Company may elect to change the way in which the Company operates or is organized in the future to enable the most efficient implementation of our strategy. Acquisition and Background of Coherent, Inc. The acquisition of Coherent, Inc. (“Legacy Coherent”), one of the world's leading providers of laser and optics-based product solutions, closed on July 1, 2022. For the full fiscal year 2023, Legacy Coherent will be included in the combined company and rebranded as the Lasers Segment. Legacy Coherent’s lasers and optics products serve industrial customers in semiconductor and display capital equipment, precision manufacturing and aerospace & defense, as well as instrumentation customers in life science and scientific instrumentation. Legacy Coherent delivers systems to the world's leading brands, innovators, and researchers, all backed with a global service and support network. Since inception in 1966, Legacy Coherent has grown through internal organic expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes, and product offerings. The word "laser" is an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." Lasers emit an intense output of light with unique and highly useful properties, of which its near perfect collimation (beam like property) is the most commonly known, as well usually being highly monochromatic at a precise wavelength (color). The name Coherent originates from another key property which is related to the synchronization of the phase of the light oscillations, known as Coherence. Therefore, lasers are many orders of magnitude brighter than any other optical source. Lasers also have the ability to be pulsed at almost any repetition rate, even beyond a billion times per second, and are the technology which underpins the global fiber optic communications network, as well as producing the shortest man-made pulses of any technology known.
As a result of their highly collimated beams, the light can be focused to a very small and intense spot or line, useful for applications requiring enough power to modify the target material, with very high precision through processes such as heat treating (annealing), welding or cutting almost any material. The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications, where the laser light is essentially a highly precise illumination source. These applications typically operate at lower powers, so as not to alter the physical property of the target material. Lasers can produce the lasing action in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber. Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable. Legacy Coherent manufactures all of these laser types, in various options such as continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, and beam dimensions. Each application has its own specific requirements in terms of laser performance. Legacy Coherent's key laser applications include: semiconductor wafer inspection; manufacturing of advanced printed circuit boards; flat panel display manufacturing; metal cutting and welding, including welding of electric vehicle batteries; manufacturing of medical devices; marking; medical; bio-instrumentation and imaging; and research and development. For example, UV lasers are enabling the continuous move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets. In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing. 32 Legacy Coherent's products are manufactured at sites in California, Oregon, Michigan, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the United States; Germany, Scotland, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, and Spain in Europe; and South Korea, China, Singapore, and Malaysia in Asia. In addition, Legacy Coherent uses contract manufacturers in southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and the United States for the production of certain assemblies and turnkey solutions. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K dated August 29, 2022 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Starting in the three months ended September 30, 2022, we assessed business combinations to be one of our critical accounting policies. Business Combinations.
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As such, assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair value, which often involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. New Accounting Standards See Note 2. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. COVID-19 Update Our supply chain continues to show signs of improving after various measures were implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In certain cases, our suppliers have not had the materials, capacity or capability to supply us with the components necessary for continuing our manufacturing operations or development efforts at our normal levels or on predictable timing.
Similarly, our customers have also experienced, and could continue to experience, disruptions in their operations, which may result in reduced, delayed, or canceled orders, and have increased collection risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related responses on our operational and financial performance is improving. However, continued improvement will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the imposition of new and additional protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic and related factors on the global economy as a whole and, in particular, demand for our products. Due to these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact on us at this time. For additional information regarding the risks that we face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on August 29, 2022. Further, to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it also may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on August 29, 2022. 33 Results of Operations ($ in millions, except per share data) The following tables set forth select items from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 ($ in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 % of Revenues % of Revenues Total revenues $ 1,370  100  % $ 807  100  % Cost of goods sold 959  70  496  61  Gross margin 411  30  311  39  Operating expenses: Internal research and development 129  9  95  12  Selling, general and administrative 274  20  118  15  Interest and other, net 75  5  19  2  Earnings (loss) before income taxes (66) (5) % 79  10  Income taxes (21) (2) % 12  1  Net earnings (loss) $ (45) (3) % $ 68  8  % Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.58) $ 0.44  Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 % of Revenues % of Revenues Total revenues $ 2,715  100  % $ 1,602  100  % Cost of goods sold 1,860  69  984  61  Gross margin 855  31  618  39  Operating expenses: Internal research and development 250  9  184  12  Selling, general and administrative 554  20  240  15  Interest and other, net 168  6  24  1  Earnings (loss) before income taxes (117) (4) % 170  11  Income taxes (34) (1) % 28  2  Net earnings (loss) $ (84) (3) % $ 142  9  % Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (1.14) $ 0.94  Consolidated Revenues.
Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 70% to $1,370 million, compared to $807 million for the same period last fiscal year. Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased 69% to $2,715 million, compared to $1,602 million for the same period last fiscal year. The majority of the increase in revenue for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 is driven by the Lasers segment, which was acquired in our acquisition of Legacy Coherent, with the remaining contributions from both the Materials and Networking segments. Lasers revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $379 million, of which 75% was in the industrial end market and 25% in the instrumentation end market. Lasers revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $772 million, of which 76% was in the industrial end market and 24% in the instrumentation end market.
Organic revenue growth was $184 million, or 23%, year-over-year for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Networking increased $92 million year-over-year, with growth in both datacom and telecom. Materials contributed an additional $92 million year-over-year, with $114 million growth in the electronics end market from innovations in sensing products, partially offset by softer sales from the industrial end market.
34 Organic revenue growth was $341 million, or 21%, year-over-year for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Networking increased $158 million year-over-year, with growth in both datacom and telecom. Materials contributed an additional $184 million year-over-year, with $213 million growth in the electronics end market from innovations in sensing products, partially offset by softer sales from the industrial end market. Gross margin.
Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $411 million, or 30% of total revenues, compared to $311 million, or 39% of total revenues, for the same period last fiscal year, a decrease of 860 basis points. Gross margin for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased to $855 million, or 31% of total revenues, compared to $618 million, or 39% of total revenues, for the same period last fiscal year, and decreased as a percent of revenue year-over-year by 710 basis points. The decrease as a percent of revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was driven by $112 million and $158 million, respectively, of additional expense related to the preliminary fair value adjustment on acquired inventory from the acquisition of Legacy Coherent (“Merger”), as well as $6 million and $43 million, respectively, of incremental amortization expense related to technology acquired as a result of the Merger. Gross margins excluding the fair value adjustment on acquired inventory and incremental amortization were flat for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year periods. Internal research and development.
Internal research and development (“IR&D”) expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $129 million, or 9% of revenues, compared to $95 million, or 12% of revenues, for the same period last fiscal year. IR&D for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased 36% to $250 million, or 9% of revenues, compared to $184 million, or 12% of revenues, for the same period last fiscal year. The increase for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was driven by an additional $32 million and $62 million, respectively, of IR&D expenses from the Lasers segment. As a percent of sales, IR&D spend in the Materials segment decreased 4% and 5% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the prior year periods due to the launch of new products. Selling, general and administrative.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $274 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $118 million, or 15% of revenues, for the same period last fiscal year. SG&A expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $554 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $240 million, or 15% of revenues, for the same period last fiscal year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period last fiscal year was primarily the result of incremental amortization expense of $80 million. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period last fiscal year was primarily the result of incremental amortization expense of $104 million, additional one time-charges related to the Merger, including $38 million additional integration and restructuring, $19 million additional transaction fees and financing, and a one-time expense of $18 million related to share-based compensation resulting from the Merger.
Interest and other, net.
Interest and other, net for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was expense of $75 million, compared to expense of $19 million for the same period last fiscal year, an increase of $56 million. Included in interest and other, net, was interest expense on borrowings, equity losses from unconsolidated investments, foreign currency gains and losses, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest income on excess cash balances. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the increase of $56 million in comparison to the same period last fiscal year was driven by $54 million of incremental interest expense due to the new debt assumed in the financing of the Merger and $7 million incremental foreign currency losses, partially offset by $2 million incremental interest income. Interest and other, net for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was expense of $168 million, compared to expense of $24 million for the same period last fiscal year, an increase of $145 million. The increase of $145 million in comparison to the same period last fiscal year was driven by $104 million incremental interest expense due to the new debt assumed in the financing of the Merger, $35 million incurred in the current year related to financing of the Merger and $9 million incremental net foreign currency losses, with a foreign currency gain of $5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a foreign currency loss of $4 million for the current six-month period. The increases were partially offset by $2 million of incremental interest income. Income taxes.
The Company’s year-to-date effective income tax rate at December 31, 2022 was 29% compared to an effective tax rate of 16% for the same period in 2021. The variations between the Company’s effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 21% were due to nondeductible expenses and tax rate differentials between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. 35 Segment Reporting Revenues and operating income for the Company’s reportable segments are discussed below. Operating income differs from net earnings in that operating income excludes certain operational expenses included in other expense (income) – net as reported. Management believes operating income to be a useful measure for investors, as it reflects the results of segment performance over which management has direct control and is used by management in its evaluation of segment performance. See Note 13. Segment Reporting, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the Company’s reportable segments and for the reconciliation of the Company’s operating income to net earnings, which is incorporated herein by reference. Effective July 1, 2022, the Company is reporting its financial results in the following three designated segments: (i) Materials, (ii) Networking, and (iii) Lasers. Financial results in prior years had been reported in the following two segments: (i) Compound Semiconductors, and (ii) Photonic Solutions. The Materials segment represents the former Compound Semiconductors segment and the Networking segment represents the former Photonic Solutions segment. The Lasers segment represents Legacy Coherent. In addition, prior year numbers were recast to reflect the transfer of two entities between the Networking and Materials segments.
Networking ($ in millions) Three Months Ended December 31, % Increase Six Months Ended December 31, % Increase 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues $ 609  $ 517  18% $ 1,205  $ 1,048  15% Operating income $ 90  $ 50  79% $ 181  $ 110  65% Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 18% to $609 million, compared to $517 million for the same period last fiscal year. Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased 15% to $1,205 million, compared to $1,048 million for the same period last fiscal year. The increases in revenue of $92 million and $158 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, were primarily due to increased revenue year-over-year in the communications market driven by increased revenue in both telecom and datacom. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 79% to $90 million, compared to operating income of $50 million for the same period last fiscal year.

The increase in revenues of $184 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to the increase in demand in the electronics end market from innovations in sensing products. 36 Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 44% to $81 million, compared to operating income of $57 million for the same period last fiscal year, primarily driven by strong sales, and the launch of a new product in the Consumer market, thereby reducing R&D expense year-over-year. Further, the Company has efficiently used the Corporate Center of Excellence, with corporate resources leveraged across each of our three segments. Operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased 52% to $157 million, compared to $103 million of operating income for the same period last fiscal year. The increase in operating income for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was driven by strong sales, the launch of a new product in the Consumer market and improved operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our primary sources of cash have been from operations, long-term borrowings, and advance funding from customers. Other sources of cash include proceeds from the issuance of equity, proceeds received from the exercises of stock options, and sale of equity investments and businesses. Our historic uses of cash have been for business acquisitions, capital expenditures, investment in research and development, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, payments of debt and equity issuance costs to obtain financing and payments in satisfaction of employees’ minimum tax obligations. Supplemental information pertaining to our sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated is presented as follows: 37 Sources (uses) of cash (millions): Six Months Ended December 31,
2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 300  $ 240  Proceeds from long-term borrowings and revolving credit facility 3,715  —  Net proceeds from debt and equity issuances 1,358  990  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and other items 17  9  Proceeds from exercises of stock options and purchases of stock under employee stock purchase plan 8  8  Other items (3) (2) Payments on Convertible Debt (4) (15) Payment of dividends (14) (21) Payments in satisfaction of employees' minimum tax obligations (51) (14) Debt issuance costs (127) (6) Additions to property, plant & equipment (246) (102) Payments on existing debt (1,130) (31) Purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired (5,489) —  Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $300 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $240 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the same period last fiscal year. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period last fiscal year was primarily due to improved management of working capital accounts.
Investing activities: Net cash used by investing activities was $5,737 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used of $102 million for the same period last fiscal year. In the three months ended September 30, 2022, $5.5 billion was used to fund the Merger. Cash used to fund capital expenditures increased by $144 million year-over-year, to continue to increase capacity to meet the growing demand for the Company’s product portfolio.
Financing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities was $3,756 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $911 million for the same period last fiscal year. Cash inflow for the current period was from borrowings under the New Term Facilities, defined below, as well the net proceeds from the issuance of Coherent's Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Financing outflows included payments to settle the Company's existing senior credit facilities. Senior Credit Facilities as of June 30, 2022 On July 1, 2022, the amounts outstanding under the Company's prior senior credit facilities were repaid in full using proceeds from the New Term Facilities (defined below). 38 Table of Contents New Senior Credit Facilities On July 1, 2022, Coherent entered into a Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the lenders, and other parties thereto, and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, which provides for senior secured financing of $4.0 billion, consisting of a term loan A credit facility (the “Term A Facility”), with an aggregate principal amount of $850 million, a term loan B credit facility (the “Term B Facility” and, together with the Term A Facility, the “Term Facilities”), with an aggregate principal amount of $2,800 million, and a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Facilities, the “Senior Credit Facilities”), in an aggregate available amount of $350 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $50 million. The Term A Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility each bear interest at LIBOR subject to a 0.00% floor plus a range of 1.75% to 2.50%, based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. The Term A Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% as of December 31, 2022. The Term B Facility bears interest at LIBOR (subject to a 0.50% floor) plus 2.75%. In relation to the Term Facilities, the Company incurred expense of $61 million and $114 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, which is included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss). The definitive documentation for the Senior Credit Facilities includes customary LIBOR replacement provisions.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company made payments of $68 million for the Term Facilities, including a voluntary prepayment of $50 million, and we expect to pay down another $75 million in total during the rest of this fiscal year.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We repaid the $65 million that was borrowed in the three months ended September 30, 2022. Our cash position, borrowing capacity and debt obligations are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 913  $ 2,582  Available borrowing capacity under New Revolving Credit Facility 350  450  Total debt obligations 4,498  2,300  On July 1, 2022, the Company utilized $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as part of the funding required to complete the Coherent acquisition. The Company believes existing cash, cash flow from operations, and available borrowing capacity from its Senior Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund its needs for working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of scheduled long-term borrowings and lease obligations, investments in internal research and development, and internal and external growth objectives at least through fiscal year 2023.
The Company’s cash and cash equivalent balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including amounts held outside the United States. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company held approxim ately $653 million of c ash
and cash equivalents outside of the United States. Cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States.
At December 31, 2022, we had $21 million of restricted cash.
39 Table of Contents Item 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISKS The Company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the normal course of business, the Company uses a variety of techniques and derivative financial instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy, which is primarily focused on its exposure in relation to the Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, Singapore Dollar and Korean Won. No significant changes have occurred in the techniques and instruments used. Interest Rate Risks As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total borrowings include variable rate borrowings, which expose the Company to changes in interest rates. On November 24, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract to limit the exposure of its variable interest rate debt by effectively converting it to fixed interest rate debt. If the Company had not effectively hedged its variable rate debt, a change in the interest rate of 100 basis points on these variable rate borrowings would have resulted in additional interest expense of $12 million for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. On February 23, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate cap (the "Cap"), with an effective date of July 1, 2023. As the Cap is not effective until July 2023, there is no impact on variable rate borrowings from the Cap for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. Item 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company’s disclosure controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, the controls have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the controls’ stated goals. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In July 2022, we completed the acquisition of Legacy Coherent. We are in the process of integrating Legacy Coherent into our systems and control environment as of December 31, 2022. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration. Other than the impact of this business acquisition, no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) were implemented during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Legacy Coherent’s operations are included in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the entire period from July 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 and represented 59% of the Company’s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2022 and 28% of the Company’s consolidated total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 40 Table of Contents Part II – Other Information Item 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company and its subsidiaries are involved from time to time in various claims, lawsuits, and regulatory proceedings incidental to its business. The resolution of each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company. Management believes, after consulting with legal counsel, that the ultimate liabilities, if any, resulting from these legal and regulatory proceedings will not materially affect the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Those risk factors are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 41 Table of Contents Item 6.    EXHIBITS Incorporated by reference herein Exhibit Numbers Form Exhibit No. Filing Date File No. 31.01* Certification of the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 31.02* Certification of the Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 32.01* Certification of the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and 18 U.S.C. § 1350 as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 32.02* Certification of the Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and 18 U.S.C. § 1350 as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 101.INS Inline XBRL Instance Document - the instance document does not appear in the interactive data file because XBRL tags are embedded within the inline XBRL document 101.SCH Inline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Schema Document 101.CAL Inline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Calculation Linkbase Document 101.LAB Inline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Label Linkbase Document 101.DEF Inline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Definition Linkbase Document 101.PRE Inline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Presentation Linkbase Document 104 Cover Page Interactive Data File - the cover page interactive data file does not appear in the Interactive Data File because its XBRL tags are embedded within the Inline XBRL document. * Filed herewith 42 Table of Contents SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
