NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Nascent Biotech, Inc. (“Nascent” or the “Company”) was incorporated on March 3, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is actively developing Pritumumab for the treatment of brain cancer and pancreatic cancer. Nascent is also actively researching other cancers that have a high probability of benefiting from the therapeutic effects of Pritumumab because they share a common target. Pritumumab has shown to be very effective at low doses in previous clinical studies in Japan. Nascent is a phase 1 clinical trial biopharmaceutical company that focuses on biologic drug candidates that are preparing for initial clinical testing for the treatment of brain and pancreatic cancer.   On March 31, 2017, the Company filed its IND submission with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clearance to begin Phase I clinical trials. On December 7, 2018, the Company received a letter from the FDA allowing it to use a specific lot of drug substance to begin phase 1 clinical trials. On March 15, 2021, the Company opened phase1 clinical trials. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had completed dosing of patients in the last cohort of the phase 1 clinical trials. The company is in the process of completing the required protocol and submitting the data to the FDA for approval to commence phase 2 clinical trials.   On November 8, 2022 the Company was granted patient No. 11.492,394 from the Untied States Patient and Trademark Office for the patient entitled “Kits and Containers for Treating Vimentin Expressing Tumors.” This is the second patient issued in favor of the Company for Pritumumab.   NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company has elected a fiscal year ending on March 31.   The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented herein. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarters or for an entire year.
Basis of Presentation   The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260,
Earnings per Share , which requires presentation of both basic and diluted loss per share (“EPS”) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method, convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive common shares if their effect is antidilutive.
We have identified the conversion features of certain of our convertible notes payable as derivatives. We estimate the fair value of the derivatives using the Black-Scholes pricing model. We estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities at the inception of the financial instruments, at the date of conversions to equity and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount, and a gain or loss on change in derivative liabilities as applicable. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material.     7 Table of Contents   Revenue recognition   In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016–10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity’s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments are intended to render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606.
ASC Topic 606 prescribes a new five-step model entities should follow in order to recognize revenue in accordance with the core principle. These five steps are:   1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.  2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.  3. Determine the transaction price.  4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.  5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfied the performance obligations.   The Company implemented the transition using the modified retrospective method of transition. The funds are not earned on milestones that have not been reached per the contract. Based on the cut off treatment of the recognition of revenue per the milestones specific to the license agreements, the Company has determined that there are no adjustments in the value of the revenue recognized from these contracts.   The Company has one revenue stream, which are the milestone payments of the license agreement with BioRay Pharmaceutical which is not earned or billed until the milestone per the agreement is met. During the nine months period ended December 31, 2022, no revenue was received.   Accounts receivable   Accounts receivables are carried at face value less any provisions for uncollectible amounts. Accounts receivable are receivables from a license agreement. No allowance for bad debt was considered necessary for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any accounts receivable.   NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN   The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a working capital deficit and has incurred losses from operations. The Company has no revenue to cover its operating costs and the Company will incur additional expenses in the future developing their product. These factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company engages in research and development activities that must be satisfied in cash secured through outside funding. The Company may offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     8 Table of Contents   NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   On September 1, 2015,
the Company entered five-year employment contracts with three of its officers and directors. One of the officers and director resigned as of September 30, 2020. Under the terms of the agreements the Company issued shares of common stock to the officers and directors equaling 11% of the outstanding shares of the Company
as of the date of the contracts.

NOTE 9 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   As defined in (Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 820), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).     12 Table of Contents   The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:   Level 1  – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives, marketable securities, and listed equities.
Level 2  – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, options, and collars.       Level 3  –  Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value   As December 31, 2022, the Company believes the amounts reported for cash, payables, accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values, due to the nature or duration of these instruments.   The following table represents the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities during the quarter ended December 31, 2022:       Level 1     Level 2     Level 3   Fair value of derivative liability as of March 31, 2022   $ -     $ -     $ -   Additions at fair value

The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth on the forward-looking statements because of the risks set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, general economic conditions, and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements.   Nascent Biotech, Inc (“Nascent” or the “Company”) was incorporated on March 3, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is actively developing Pritumumab for the treatment of brain cancer and pancreatic cancer. Nascent is also actively researching other cancers that have a high probability of benefiting from the therapeutic effects of Pritumumab because they share a common target.   Nascent is a phase 1 clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that develops monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of various forms of cancer. The Company focuses on biologic drug candidates that are undergoing or have already completed initial clinical testing for the treatment of cancer and then seek to further develop those drug candidates for commercial use. Nascent currently is developing for the treatment of brain cancer and pancreatic cancer both of which we hold orphan drug status granted by the FDA. Nascent completed Cohort 4 and open cohort 5 on September 16, 2022 of the phase 1 clinical trials. As of December 31, 2022 the Company had completed the infusion of final patients in Cohort 5 ending the addition of any new patients in the phase 1 clinical trials.   In addition, Nascent has begun, in collaboration with academic and corporate partners, to assess the potential for pritumumab to be involved as both a treatment and a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.   Overview   The Company is focused on developing pritumumab for the treatment of patients with brain cancer malignancies such as gliomas and astrocytomas. Current therapeutic strategies for brain cancer include the use of the chemotherapy, surgical intervention or radiation therapy. Because these treatments have marginal outcomes there exists a need to develop safer, more effective drugs. Temodar-the most commonly used Chemotherapeutic drug used to treat brain cancer, is attributed to only median rates of survival and many brain tumors are eligible for surgery. Moreover, even when removed, most brain tumors come back within one year post-operation. Today, with current standards of care, less than 60% of all brain cancer patients will live past the first year after diagnosis, and less than 35% of patients will live to five years. Glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer that constitutes 42% of ALL brain and other nervous system cancers, has survival rates of 36.5% at 1 year and 5% at 5 years. (SEER Registry Data, September 15 th , 2016 (Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States).   On March 31, 2017, the Company filed its IND submission with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clearance to begin Phase I clinical trials. On December 7, 2018, the Company received a letter from the FDA allowing it to use a specific lot of drug substance to begin phase 1 clinical trials. The Company is in human clinical trials with a major oncology hospital for brain cancer, both primary and metastatic As of December 31, 2022, the Company had completed dosing of patients in the last cohort of the phase 1 clinical trials. The company is in the process of completing the required protocol and submitting the data to the FDA for approval to commence phase 2 clinical trials.   In May of 2020, Nascent announced a research collaboration to study, both
in vitro
and
in vivo
(mouse models), the ability of pritumumab to block the SARS-Cov-2 virus from infecting cells. This notion has been raised by a published article in the scientific literature ( Yu et al. Journal of Biomedical Science (2016) 23:14 DOI 10.1186/s12929-016-0234-7 ), which specifically mentioned cell surface vimentin (the protein to which pritumumab binds selectively) as a potential target in the treatment of conditions related to coronaviruses. These preliminary studies are on-going. Further, in May of 2020, Nascent announced a joint collaboration with Manhattan BioSolutions, Inc to employ Manhattan’s platform, based on the recombinant Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, but engineered to target SARS-CoV-2. BCG is a live non-pathogenic bacterium that stimulates diverse innate and adaptive immune responses and is well-known for its long safety track record as a tuberculosis vaccine.

This increase in expenses for the nine month ended December 31, 2022 over the same period in 2021 was due primarily to increased consulting fee of $494,842, a result of the pricing of the shares issued to management for maintaining the percentage of ownership per their agreements.   Research and development expenses for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 was $55,875 and $188,503 compared to $41,000 and $139,531 in the same periods in 2021.

The difference between the periods relates to higher consulting costs experienced in 2022 plus higher other expenses, during the nine months period in 2022 verses 2021 plus the license revenue earned in the nine month period ended December 31, 2021 with no income in the same period in 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company’s liquidity and capital is dependent on the capital it can raise to continue the Company’s testing and clinical trials of its product. The Company projects it must raise additional funds to complete its Phase II clinical studies for both brain and pancreatic cancer.   There are no agreements or understandings about future loans by or with the officers, directors, principals, affiliates, or shareholders of the Company. The Company will continue to raise outside capital through loans, equity sales and possible licensing agreements. These factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.   At December 31, 2022, the Company had negative working capital of $1,364,074. Current assets consist of cash of $558,764 and prepaid of $7,083 with current liabilities $1,929,918 consisting of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $387,253, convertible notes, net of discount of $470,171, plus derivative liability of $1,072,494. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense was due primarily to the payment of an outstanding payment payable with a manufacturer of $325,000.   Net cash used in operating activities in the nine month period ended December 31, 2022 was $1,400,650 compared to net cash provided of $120,803 in the same period in 2021. The variance between the same periods in 2022 over 2021 relates mainly to a significant loss in 2022 of $2,282,910 compared to $ 63,783 resulting from higher expense in 2022 against revenue of $1,000,000 in 2021 with none in 2022.

The Company is engaged in research and development activities that must be satisfied in cash secured through outside funding. The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders.   Our current capital will take us through Phase I clinical trials which was completed as of December 31, 2022 and the FDA approval process for Phase 2. It is estimated Phase 2 trials will require an additional $20-25 million for completion of the brain and pancreatic cancer trials.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We had no off-balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at December 31, 2022.   Inflation   We believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since inception.   ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK   Not applicable.   ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Under the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation as of September30, 2022, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. Such conclusion reflects the identification of material weakness as follows: (1) lack of accounting proficiency of our chief executive officer who is our sole officer and our principal accounting officer which has resulted in a reliance on part-time outside consultants to perform substantially all of our accounting functions, (2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting process and accounting function, and (3) lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of review. Until we can remedy these material weaknesses, we have engaged third party consultants and accounting firm to assist with financial reporting.
