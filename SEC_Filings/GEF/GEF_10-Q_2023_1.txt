The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The fiscal year of Greif, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) begins on November 1 and ends on October 31 of the following year. Any references to years or to any quarter of those years, relates to the fiscal year or quarter, as the case may be, ended in that year, unless otherwise stated.

NOTE 2 —
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Acquisitions Lee Container Acquisition The Company completed its acquisition of Lee Container Corporation, Inc. (“Lee Container”)
on
December 15, 2022
(the “Lee Container Acquisition”). Lee Container is
an industry-leading manufacturer of high-performance barrier, conventional blow molded containers, jerrycans and small plastics .
The total purchase price for this acquisition, net of cash acquired, was $ 302.8  million. The Company incurred transaction costs of $ 5.1  million to complete this acquisition. 10 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the consideration transferred to acquire Lee Container and the preliminary valuation of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: (in millions) Amounts Recognized as of the Acquisition Date Fair value of consideration transferred Cash consideration $ 302.8   Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Accounts receivable $ 21.9   Inventories 27.5   Prepaid and other current assets 0.5   Intangibles 133.5   Finance lease assets 32.4   Properties, plants and equipment 54.7   Total assets acquired 270.5   Accounts payable ( 3.9 ) Accrued payroll and employee benefits ( 1.3 ) Other current liabilities ( 3.1 ) Finance lease liabilities ( 30.6 ) Total liabilities assumed ( 38.9 ) Total identifiable net assets $ 231.6   Goodwill $ 71.2   The Company recognized goodwill related to this acquisition of $ 71.2
million. The goodwill recognized in this acquisition is attributable to the acquired assembled workforce, expected synergies, and economies of scale, none of which qualify for recognition as a separate intangible asset. Lee Container is reported within the Global Industrial Packaging segment to which the goodwill was assigned. The goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The cost approach was used to determine the fair value for building improvements and equipment. The cost approach measures the value by estimating the cost to acquire, or construct, comparable assets and adjusts for age and condition. The Company assigned building improvements a useful life ranging from  1  year to  9
years and equipment a useful life ranging from  1  year to  19  years. Acquired property, plant and equipment are being depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives on a straight-line basis. The fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles was determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair values of the trade name intangible assets were determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trade names and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate.  11 Table of Contents Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over the estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.  The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation and weighted average remaining useful lives for identifiable intangible assets acquired: (in millions) Final Purchase Price Allocation Weighted Average Estimated Useful Life Customer relationships $ 120.0   15.0 Trademarks 13.5   5.0 Total intangible assets $ 133.5   The Company has not yet finalized the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including income taxes and contingencies. The Company expects to finalize these amounts within one year of the acquisition date. The estimate of fair value and purchase price allocation were based on information available at the time of closing the acquisition, and the Company continues to evaluate the underlying inputs and assumptions that are being used in fair value estimates. Accordingly, these preliminary estimates are subject to adjustments during the measurement period, not to exceed one year, based upon new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the date of closing the acquisition.
Lee Container’s results of operations have been included in the Company’s financial statements for the period subsequent to the acquisition date of December 15, 2022. Lee Container contributed net sales of $ 18.0  million for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The following unaudited supplemental pro forma data presents consolidated information as if the acquisition had been completed on November 1, 2021. These amounts were calculated after adjusting Lee Container’s results to reflect interest expense incurred on the debt to finance the acquisition, additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied from November 1, 2021, the adjusted tax expense, and related transaction costs.
Three Months Ended January 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 Pro forma net sales $ 1,288.4   $ 1,602.9   Pro forma net income attributable to Greif, Inc. 102.2   9.5   Basic earnings per share attributable to Greif, Inc. common shareholders: Class A common stock $ 1.76   $ 0.16   Class B common stock $ 2.63   $ 0.24   Diluted earnings per share attributable to Greif, Inc. common shareholders: Class A common stock $ 1.75   $ 0.17   Class B common stock $ 2.63   $ 0.24   The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is based on the Company’s preliminary assignment of purchase price and therefore subject to adjustment upon finalizing the purchase price assignment. The pro forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition and related financing had been consummated on the assumed completion dates, nor are they indicative of future results. Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
The terms of the joint venture agreement for
one
joint venture within the Global Industrial Packaging reportable segment include mandatory redemption by the Company, in cash, of the noncontrolling interest holders’ equity at a formulaic price after the expiration of a lockout period specific to each noncontrolling interest holder. The Company redeemed the
5.2 % outstanding equity interest of the noncontrolling interest holder in this joint venture on January 26, 2023 for $ 3.3  million. 12 Table of Contents Divestitures Tama Divestiture During the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed its divestiture of a U.S. business in the Paper Packaging & Services segment, Tama Paperboard, LLC (the “Tama Divestiture”), for current net cash proceeds of $ 100.2  million. The Tama Divestiture did not qualify as discontinued operations as it did not represent a strategic shift that has had a major impact on the Company’s operations or financial results. The Tama Divestiture resulted in $ 54.6  million gain on sale of business, including goodwill allocated to the sale of $ 22.5  million. NOTE 3 —

The 2022 Credit Agreement amended, restated and replaced in its entirety the Company’s previous credit agreement, referred to as the “2019 Credit Agreement”. The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for (a) an $ 800.0  million secured revolving credit facility, consisting of a $ 725.0  million multicurrency facility and a $ 75.0  million U.S. dollar facility, maturing on March 1, 2027, (b) a $ 1,100  million secured term loan A-1 facility with quarterly principal installments that commenced on July 31, 2022 and continue through January 31, 2027, with any outstanding principal balance of such term loan A-1 facility being due and payable on maturity on March 1, 2027, and (c) a $ 515.0  million secured term loan A-2 facility with quarterly principal installments that commenced on July 31, 2022 and continue through January 31, 2027, with any outstanding principal balance of such term loan A-2 being due and payable on maturity on March 1, 2027. The term loan A-2 facility reflects the combination of the outstanding balances of the secured term A-2 and A-3 loans under the 2019 Credit Agreement. Interest is based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a credit spread adjustment, Euro Interbank Offer Rate (“EURIBOR”) or a base rate that resets periodically plus, in each case, a calculated margin amount that is based on the Company’s leverage ratio. Subject to the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement, the Company has an option to borrow additional funds under the 2022 Credit Agreement with the agreement of the lenders. As of January 31, 2023, $ 1,906.4
million was outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The current portion was $ 80.8
million, and the long-term portion was $ 1,825.6
million. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement was
5.08 % for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The actual interest rate for borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement was
5.58 % as of January 31, 2023. The deferred financing costs associated with the term loan portion of the 2022 Credit Agreement totaled $ 7.7
million as of January 31, 2023 and are recorded as a reduction of long-term debt on the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. The deferred financing costs associated with the revolving portion of the 2022 Credit Agreement totaled $ 4.3
million as of January 31, 2023 and are recorded within other long-term assets on the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. United States Trade Accounts Receivable Credit Facility On May 17, 2022, Greif Receivables Funding LLC (“Greif Funding”), Greif Packaging LLC (“Greif Packaging”), and certain other U.S. subsidiaries of the Company, amended and restated its U.S. receivables financing facility (the “U.S. Receivables Facility”). The amended and restated U.S. Receivables Facility has a maturity date of May 17, 2023 and provides an accounts receivable financing facility of $ 300.0  million. As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 247.1  million outstanding under the U.S. Receivables Facility that is reported as long-term debt on the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets because the Company intends to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis and has the intent and ability to consummate a long-term refinancing. Greif Funding is a direct subsidiary of Greif Packaging and is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, because Greif Funding is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Company, the assets of Greif Funding are not available to satisfy the liabilities and obligations of the Company, Greif Packaging or other subsidiaries of the Company, and the liabilities of Greif Funding are not the liabilities or obligations of the Company or its other subsidiaries.
14 Table of Contents International Trade Accounts Receivable Credit Facility On April 20, 2022, Cooperage Receivables Finance B.V. and Greif Services Belgium BV, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Greif, Inc., amended and restated the Nieuw Amsterdam Receivables Financing Agreement (the “European RFA”) with affiliates of a major international bank. The amended and restated European RFA matures April 24, 2023. The European RFA provides an accounts receivable financing facility of up to € 100.0
million ($ 108.7
million as of January 31, 2023) secured by certain European accounts receivable. The $ 78.7  million outstanding on the European RFA as of January 31, 2023 is reported as long-term debt on the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets because the Company intends to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis and has the intent and ability to consummate a long-term refinancing.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Recurring Fair Value Measurements The following table presents the fair value for those assets and (liabilities) measured on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022: January 31, 2023 Assets Liabilities (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Interest rate derivatives $ —   $ 54.5   $ —   $ 54.5   $ —   $ ( 9.4 ) $ —   $ ( 9.4 ) Foreign exchange hedges —   0.7   —   0.7   —   ( 3.5 ) —   ( 3.5 ) Insurance annuity —   —   19.4   19.4   —   —   —   —   Cross currency swap —   29.5   —   29.5   —   —   —   —   October 31, 2022 Assets Liabilities (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Interest rate derivatives $ —   $ 72.1   $ —   $ 72.1   $ —   $ ( 1.0 ) $ —   $ ( 1.0 ) Foreign exchange hedges —   —   —   —   —   ( 0.2 ) —   ( 0.2 ) Insurance annuity —   —   17.8   17.8   —   —   —   —   Cross currency swap —   46.8   —   46.8   —   —   —   —   The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, current liabilities and short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these items and are not included in this table. Interest Rate Derivatives As of January 31, 2023, the Company has various interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $ 1,300.0
million, maturing between March 11, 2024 and July 15, 2029. The Company will receive variable rate interest payments based upon one-month U.S. dollar SOFR, and in return the Company will be obligated to pay interest at a weighted average fixed interest rate of
2.62 %. This effectively will convert the borrowing rate on an amount of debt equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swaps from a variable rate to a fixed rate. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the gain or loss on these derivative instruments is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. See Note 12 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures of the aggregate gain or loss included within other comprehensive income. The assumptions used in measuring fair value of these interest rate derivatives are considered level 2 inputs, which are based upon observable market rates, including SOFR and interest paid based upon a designated fixed rate over the life of the swap agreements. Gains (losses) reclassified to earnings under these contracts were $ 4.7
million and $( 4.3 ) million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. A derivative gain of $ 28.5
million, based upon interest rates at January 31, 2023, is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the next twelve months. 15 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Hedges The Company conducts business in various international currencies and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. The Company’s objective is to reduce volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of certain existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency cash flows. As of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts in the notional amount of $ 135.7
million and $ 132.1
million, respectively. Adjustments to fair value are recognized in earnings, offsetting the impact of the hedged profits. The assumptions used in measuring fair value of foreign exchange hedges are considered level 2 inputs, which are based on observable market pricing for similar instruments, principally foreign exchange futures contracts.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded realized gain (loss) of $ 0.1
million and $( 2.4 ) million under fair value contracts in other expense, net. For the three months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded an unrealized net gain (loss) of $( 2.8 ) million and $ 1.0
million in other expense, net. Cross Currency Swap The Company has operations and investments in various international locations and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has various cross currency interest rate swaps that synthetically swap $ 334.4
million of fixed rate debt to Euro denominated fixed rate debt. The Company receives a weighted average rate of
1.56 % on these swaps. These agreements are designated as either net investment hedges or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and will mature between March 6, 2023 and October 5, 2026. The gain or loss on these net investment hedge derivative instruments is included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income until the net investment is sold, diluted, or liquidated. See Note 12 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures of the aggregate gain or loss included within other comprehensive income. The gain or loss on the cash flow hedge derivative instruments is included in the unrealized foreign exchange component of other expense, offset by the underlying gain or loss on the underlying cash flows that are being hedged. Interest payments received for the cross currency swap are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. The assumptions used in measuring fair value of the cross currency swap are considered level 2 inputs, which are based upon the Euro to United States dollar exchange rate market. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, gains recorded in interest expense, net under the cross currency swap agreements were $ 1.4
million. Other Financial Instruments The fair values of the Company’s 2022 Credit Agreement, the U.S. Receivables Facility and the European RFA do not materially differ from carrying value as the Company’s cost of borrowing is variable and approximates current borrowing rates. The fair values of the Company’s long-term obligations are estimated based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current interest rates offered for the debt of the same remaining maturities, which are considered level 2 inputs in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” 16 Table of Contents Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements The following table presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the impairment of long-lived assets held and used and net assets held for sale for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022:   Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (in millions) Impairment Amount Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range of Input Values January 31, 2023 Long Lived Assets $ 0.5   Discounted Cash Flows; Indicative Bids Discounted Cash Flows; Indicative Bids N/A Total $ 0.5   January 31, 2022 Impairment of Net Assets Held for Sale $ 62.4   Indicative Bids Indicative Bids N/A Total $ 62.4   Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded
no
impairment charges related to assets and liabilities held for sale. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to divest its approximately
50 % equity interest in the Flexible Products & Services business (the “FPS Divestiture”). This agreement triggered the reclassification of the Flexible Products & Services business to assets and liabilities held for sale, which further resulted in recognized impairment charges of $ 62.4  million in the first quarter of 2022. The assumptions used in measuring fair value of assets and liabilities held for sale are considered level 3 inputs, which include recent purchase offers, market comparables and/or data obtained from commercial real estate brokers. Long-Lived Assets As necessary, based on triggering events, the Company measures long-lived assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The Company recorded $ 0.5
million impairment charges related to properties, plants and equipment, net during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and
no
impairment charges related to properties, plants and equipment, net during the three months ended January 31, 2022, respectively. The assumptions used in measuring fair value of long-lived assets are considered level 3 inputs, which include bids received from third parties, recent purchase offers, market comparable information and discounted cash flows based on assumptions that market participants would use. NOTE 6 –
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Long-Term Incentive Plan The Company’s 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2020 LTIP”) is intended to focus management on the key measures that drive superior performance over the longer term. The 2020 LTIP provides key employees with incentive compensation based upon consecutive and overlapping
three-year
performance periods that commence at the start of every year. For each
three-year
performance period, the performance goals are based on performance criteria as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. For each
three-year
performance period commencing at the beginning of the year, participants may be granted restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or performance stock units (“PSUs”) or a combination of both. The Company may grant RSUs based on a
three-year
vesting period on the basis of service only. The RSUs are an equity-classified plan measured at fair value on the grant date recognized ratably over the service period. Dividend-equivalent rights may be granted in connection with an RSU award and are recognized in conjunction with the Company’s dividend issuance and settled upon vesting of the award. 17 Table of Contents The Company granted
105,753
RSUs on December 14, 2022, for the performance period commencing on November 1, 2022 and ending October 31, 2025. The weighted average fair value of the RSUs granted on that date was $ 68.99 . During the first quarter of 2023, the Company issued
75,575
shares of Class A Common Stock excluding shares withheld for the payment of taxes owed by recipients for RSUs vested for the performance period commencing on November 1, 2020 and ending October 31, 2022. Under the 2020 LTIP, the Company may grant PSUs for a
three-year
performance period based upon service, performance criteria and market conditions. The performance criteria are based on targeted levels of (a) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and (b) total shareholder return, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The PSUs are a liability-classified plan wherein the fair value of the PSUs awarded is determined at each reporting period using a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation uses assumptions including the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock price, and expected life of the awards to determine a fair value of the market condition throughout the vesting period. The Company granted
183,218
PSUs on December 14, 2022, for the performance period commencing on November 1, 2022 and ending October 31, 2025. If earned, the PSUs are to be awarded in shares of Class A Common Stock. The weighted average fair value of the PSUs granted on that date was $ 70.06 . The weighted average fair value of the PSUs at January 31, 2023 was $ 71.86 . During the first quarter of 2023, the Company issued
255,030
shares of Class A Common Stock excluding shares withheld for the payment of taxes owed by recipients for PSUs vested for the performance period commencing on November 1, 2020 and ending October 31, 2022. NOTE 7 —
INCOME TAXES Income tax expense for the quarter and year to date periods was computed in accordance with ASC 740-270 “Income Taxes - Interim Reporting.” Under this method, losses from jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance has been provided have not been included in the amount to which the ASC 740-270 rate was applied. The Company’s income tax expense may fluctuate due to changes in estimated losses and income from jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the timing of recognition of the related tax expense under ASC 740-270, and the impact of discrete items in the respective quarter. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, income tax expense was $ 37.7
million and $ 35.6  million, respectively. The $ 2.1  million net increase in income tax expense for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to nondeductible goodwill associated with the Tama Divestiture, net of reduced tax expense on lower pre-tax book income excluding the book gain on the Tama Divestiture. Additionally, in 2022, a $ 62.4  million book impairment was recorded for the FPS Divestiture for which no tax benefit was recorded. NOTE 8 —
POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS The components of net periodic pension cost include the following:   Three Months Ended January 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Service cost $ 2.0   $ 3.0   Interest cost 8.7   5.1   Expected return on plan assets ( 9.7 ) ( 8.2 ) Amortization of prior service cost ( 0.1 ) ( 0.1 ) Recognized net actuarial loss ( 0.5 ) 2.0   Net periodic pension cost $ 0.4   $ 1.8   As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K, the Company expects to make employer contributions of $ 28.4
million, including benefits paid directly by the Company, during 2023. The components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit, other than the service cost components, are included in the line item “Other income, net” in the interim condensed consolidated statements of income. 18 Table of Contents NOTE 9 —
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES Litigation-related Liabilities The Company may become involved from time-to-time in litigation and regulatory matters incidental to its business, including governmental investigations, enforcement actions, personal injury claims, product liability, employment health and safety matters, commercial disputes, intellectual property matters, disputes regarding environmental clean-up costs, litigation in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of its business. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in such litigation. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on its interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company may accrue for contingencies related to litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine whether its accruals are adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Environmental Reserves As of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, the Company’s environmental reserves were $ 19.2  million and $ 19.0  million, respectively. These reserves are principally based on environmental studies and cost estimates provided by third parties, but also take into account management estimates. The estimated liabilities are reduced to reflect the anticipated participation of other potentially responsible parties in those instances where it is probable that such parties are legally responsible and financially capable of paying their respective shares of relevant costs. For sites that involve formal actions subject to joint and several liabilities, these actions have formal agreements in place to apportion the liability.
As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, the Company has accrued $ 9.8  million for the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site in New Jersey. Aside from the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, other environmental reserves of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 included $ 9.4  million and $ 9.2  million, respectively, for its various facilities around the world. It is possible that there could be resolution of uncertainties in the future that would require the Company to record charges that could be material to future earnings. The Company’s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material. Although environmental remediation could have a material effect on results of operations if a series of adverse developments occur in a particular quarter or year, the Company believes that the chance of a series of adverse developments occurring in the same quarter or year is remote. Future information and developments will require the Company to continually reassess the expected impact of these environmental matters. NOTE 10 —
EARNINGS PER SHARE The Company has
two
classes of common stock and, as such, applies the “two-class method” of computing earnings per share (“EPS”) as prescribed in ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” In accordance with this guidance, earnings are allocated in the same fashion as dividends would be distributed. Under the Company’s certificate of incorporation, any distribution of dividends in any year must be made in proportion of
one
cent a share for Class A Common Stock to one and one-half cents a share for Class B Common Stock, which results in a
40 % to
60 % split to Class A and B shareholders, respectively. In accordance with this, earnings are allocated first to Class A and Class B Common Stock to the extent that dividends are actually paid and the remainder is allocated assuming all of the earnings for the period have been distributed in the form of dividends. 19 Table of Contents The Company calculates EPS as follows: Basic Class A EPS = 40% * Average Class A Shares Outstanding * Undistributed Net Income + Class A Dividends Per Share 40% * Average Class A Shares Outstanding + 60% * Average Class B Shares Outstanding Average Class A Shares Outstanding Diluted Class A EPS = 40% * Average Class A Shares Outstanding * Undistributed Net Income + Class A Dividends Per Share 40% * Average Class A Shares Outstanding + 60% * Average Class B Shares Outstanding Average Diluted Class A Shares Outstanding Basic Class B EPS = 60% * Average Class B Shares Outstanding * Undistributed Net Income + Class B Dividends Per Share 40% * Average Class A Shares Outstanding + 60% * Average Class B Shares Outstanding Average Class B Shares Outstanding          *Diluted Class B EPS calculation is identical to Basic Class B calculation The following table provides EPS information for each period, respectively:   Three Months Ended January 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Numerator for basic and diluted EPS Net income attributable to Greif, Inc. $ 89.9   $ 10.3   Cash dividends ( 28.9 ) ( 27.2 ) Undistributed earnings attributable to Greif, Inc. $ 61.0   $ ( 16.9 ) The Class A Common Stock has no voting rights unless four quarterly cumulative dividends upon the Class A Common Stock are in arrears. The Class B Common Stock has full voting rights. There is no cumulative voting for the election of directors. Common Stock Repurchases In June 2022, the Stock Repurchase Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $ 150.0  million of shares of the Company’s Class A or Class B Common Stock or any combination thereof. On June 23, 2022, the Company entered into a $ 75.0  million accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with Bank of America, N.A. for the repurchase of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. In addition, the Company plans to repurchase an aggregate of $ 75.0  million of shares of its Class A or Class B Common Stock, or any combination thereof, in open market purchases (“OSR program”). Under the ASR, on June 24, 2022, the Company made a payment of $ 75.0  million and received an initial delivery of approximately
80 % of the expected share repurchases, or
1,021,451
shares of Class A Common Stock, with any remaining shares expected to be delivered by the end of the Company’s second quarter 2023. The ASR has been accounted for as a purchase of shares of Class A Common Stock and a forward purchase contract. The final number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR less a discount. The Company has treated the shares of Class A Common Stock delivered as treasury shares as of the date the shares were physically delivered in computing the weighted average shares outstanding of Class A Common Stock for both basic and diluted earnings per share. The forward stock purchase contract was determined to be indexed to the Company’s own stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification. On February 28, 2023, the Company received the remaining
94,259
shares of Class A Common Stock. The Company began making repurchases of Class B Common Stock under the OSR program on September 9, 2022, and the Company may continue to make open market repurchases over the next
12
to
18
months under this program, all in accordance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing of any such repurchases will depend on
20 Table of Contents market conditions and will be made at the Company’s discretion. While the Company intends to repurchase up to $ 75.0  million of shares, it is not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or number or class of shares and may suspend or discontinue repurchases at any time. As of January 31, 2023,
402,926
shares of Class B Common Stock had been repurchased under the OSR program. The following table summarizes the shares of the Company’s Class A and Class B Common Stock as of the specified dates: Authorized Shares Issued Shares Outstanding Shares Treasury Shares January 31, 2023 Class A Common Stock 128,000,000   42,281,920   25,936,892   16,345,028   Class B Common Stock 69,120,000   34,560,000   21,604,799   12,955,201   October 31, 2022 Class A Common Stock 128,000,000   42,281,920   25,606,287   16,675,633   Class B Common Stock 69,120,000   34,560,000   21,836,745   12,723,255   The following is a reconciliation of the shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share:   Three Months Ended January 31,   2023 2022 Class A Common Stock: Basic shares 25,652,383   26,573,932   Assumed conversion of restricted shares 135,076   176,538   Diluted shares 25,787,459   26,750,470   Class B Common Stock: Basic and diluted shares 21,721,601   22,007,725   NOTE 11 —
LEASES The Company leases certain buildings, warehouses, land, transportation equipment, operating equipment, and office equipment with remaining lease terms from less than
1
year up to
19
years. The Company reviews all options to extend, terminate, or purchase a right of use asset at the time of lease inception and accounts for options deemed reasonably certain.
The Company combines lease and non-lease components for all leases, except real estate, for which these components are presented separately. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not capitalized and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The implicit rate is not readily determinable for substantially all of the Company’s leases, and therefore the initial present value of lease payments is calculated utilizing an estimated incremental borrowing rate determined at the portfolio level based on market and Company specific information. Certain of the Company’s leases include variable costs.

OVERVIEW Business Segments We operate in three reportable business segments: Global Industrial Packaging; Paper Packaging & Services; and Land Management. In the Global Industrial Packaging reportable segment, we are a leading global producer of industrial packaging products, such as steel, fibre and plastic drums, rigid intermediate bulk containers, jerrycans and other small plastics, closure systems for industrial packaging products, transit protection products, water bottles and remanufactured and reconditioned industrial containers, and services, such as container life cycle management, filling, logistics, warehousing and other packaging services. We sell our industrial packaging products on a global basis to customers in industries such as chemicals, paints and pigments, food and beverage, petroleum, industrial coatings, agriculture, pharmaceutical and minerals, among others. In the Paper Packaging & Services reportable segment, we produce and sell containerboard, corrugated sheets, corrugated containers, and other corrugated products to customers in North America in industries such as packaging, automotive, food and building products. Our corrugated container products are used to ship such diverse products as home appliances, small machinery, grocery products, automotive components, books and furniture, as well as numerous other applications. We also produce and sell coated recycled paperboard and uncoated recycled paperboard, some of which we use to produce and sell industrial products (tubes and cores, construction products, and protective packaging). In addition, we also purchase and sell recycled fiber and produce and sell adhesives used in out paperboard products. In the Land Management reportable segment, we are focused on the active harvesting and regeneration of our United States timber properties to achieve sustainable long-term yields. While timber sales are subject to fluctuations, we seek to maintain a consistent cutting schedule, within the limits of market and weather conditions. We also sell, from time to time, timberland and special use land, which consists of surplus land, HBU land and development land. As of January 31, 2023, we owned approximately 175,000 acres of timber property in the southeastern United States, which includes 18,800 acres of special use land. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, in accordance with these principles, require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2022 Form 10-K. We believe that the consistent application of these policies enables us to provide readers of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our results of operations and financial condition. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from the disclosures contained in the 2022 Form 10-K, except for the inclusion of our business combinations policies as discussed below and in Note 2 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 27 Table of Contents Business Combinations We completed our acquisition of Lee Container Corporation, Inc. (“Lee Container”)
on
December 15, 2022
(the “Lee Container Acquisition”). Lee Container is
an industry-leading manufacturer of high-performance barrier, conventional blow molded containers, jerrycans and small plastics and expanded the Global Industrial Packaging segment portfolio. Lee Container’s results of operations have been included in our financial results for the period subsequent to its acquisition date. Under the acquisition method of accounting, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration transferred to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. The fair values assigned, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants, are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. The excess purchase consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. See Note 2 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Recently Issued and Newly Adopted Accounting Standards There have been no new accounting pronouncements issued or adopted since the filing of the 2022 Form 10-K that have significance, or potential significance, to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following comparative information is presented for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. Historical revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results as a result of various economic and other factors. Items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors, of the 2022 Form 10-K. Actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions, or if conditions are significantly different in the future. The non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used throughout the following discussion of our results of operations, both for our consolidated and segment results. For our consolidated results, EBITDA is defined as net income, plus interest expense, net, plus debt extinguishment charges, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation, depletion and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus restructuring charges, plus timberland gains, net, plus acquisition and integration related costs, plus non-cash asset impairment charges, plus non-cash pension settlement (income) charges, plus (gain) loss on disposal of properties, plants, equipment and businesses, net. Since we do not calculate net income by reportable segment, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment are reconciled to operating profit by reportable segment. In that case, EBITDA is defined as operating profit by reportable segment less other (income) expense, net, less non-cash pension settlement (income) charges, less equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax, plus depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for that reportable segment, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus restructuring charges, plus timberland gains, net, plus acquisition and integration related costs, plus non-cash asset impairment charges, plus non-cash pension settlement charges, plus (gain) loss on disposal of properties, plants, equipment and businesses, net, for that reportable segment. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to evaluate our historical and ongoing operations and believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to enable investors to perform meaningful comparisons of our historical and current performance. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with our financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of this financial information should not place undue reliance on the non-GAAP financial measures. 28 Table of Contents First Quarter Results The following table sets forth the net sales, operating profit, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each of our business segments for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended January 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Net sales: Global Industrial Packaging $ 705.8  $ 949.1  Paper Packaging & Services 560.2  610.0  Land Management 5.0  5.2  Total net sales $ 1,271.0  $ 1,564.3  Operating profit: Global Industrial Packaging $ 45.9  $ 31.0  Paper Packaging & Services 109.1  38.3  Land Management 1.4  2.7  Total operating profit $ 156.4  $ 72.0  EBITDA: Global Industrial Packaging $ 64.2  $ 51.0  Paper Packaging & Services 142.5  76.2  Land Management 2.0  3.5  Total EBITDA $ 208.7  $ 130.7  Adjusted EBITDA: Global Industrial Packaging $ 71.8  $ 114.2  Paper Packaging & Services 90.7  80.5  Land Management 2.0  2.1  Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 164.5  $ 196.8  29 Table of Contents The following table sets forth EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, reconciled to net income and operating profit, for our consolidated results for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended January 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Net income $ 93.1  $ 18.6  Plus: interest expense, net 22.8  17.1  Plus: income tax expense 37.7  35.6  Plus: depreciation, depletion and amortization expense 55.1  59.4  EBITDA $ 208.7  $ 130.7  Net income $ 93.1  $ 18.6  Plus: interest expense, net 22.8  17.1  Plus: income tax expense 37.7  35.6  Plus: other expense, net 3.3  2.0  Plus: equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax (0.5) (1.3) Operating profit 156.4  72.0  Less: other expense, net 3.3  2.0  Less: equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax (0.5) (1.3) Plus: depreciation, depletion and amortization expense 55.1  59.4  EBITDA 208.7  130.7  Plus: restructuring charges 2.4  3.5  Plus: acquisition and integration related costs 7.5  1.6  Plus: non-cash asset impairment charges 0.5  62.4  Plus: gain on disposal of properties, plants, equipment, and businesses, net (54.6) (1.4) Adjusted EBITDA $ 164.5  $ 196.8  30 Table of Contents The following table sets forth EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for our business segments, reconciled to the operating profit for each segment, for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended January 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Global Industrial Packaging Operating profit $ 45.9  $ 31.0  Less: other expense, net 3.6  1.9  Less: equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax (0.5) (1.3) Plus: depreciation and amortization expense 21.4  20.6  EBITDA 64.2  51.0  Plus: restructuring charges 2.1  2.1  Plus: acquisition and integration related costs 5.0  —  Plus: non-cash asset impairment charges 0.5  62.4  Plus: gain on disposal of properties, plants, equipment, and businesses, net —  (1.3) Adjusted EBITDA $ 71.8  $ 114.2  Paper Packaging & Services Operating profit $ 109.1  $ 38.3  Less: other (income) loss, net (0.3) 0.1  Plus: depreciation and amortization expense 33.1  38.0  EBITDA 142.5  76.2  Plus: restructuring charges 0.3  1.4  Plus: acquisition and integration related costs 2.5  1.6  Plus: (gain) loss on disposal of properties, plants, equipment, and businesses, net (54.6) 1.3  Adjusted EBITDA $ 90.7  $ 80.5  Land Management Operating profit $ 1.4  $ 2.7  Plus: depreciation and depletion expense 0.6  0.8  EBITDA 2.0  3.5  Plus: gain on disposal of properties, plants, equipment, and businesses, net —  (1.4) Adjusted EBITDA $ 2.0  $ 2.1  Net Sales Net sales were $1,271.0 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $1,564.3 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $293.3 million decrease was primarily due to lower average sale prices and volumes across the Global Industrial Packaging segment, lower volumes across the Paper Packaging & Services segment and the impact to net sales resulting from the divestiture of the Flexibles Product & Services business in the second quarter of 2022 (the “FPS Divestiture”), partially offset by higher published containerboard and boxboard prices across the Paper Packaging & Services segment. See the “Segment Review” below for additional information on net sales by segment for the first quarter of 2023. Gross Profit Gross profit was $251.6 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $289.7 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $38.1 million decrease was primarily due to the same factors that impacted net sales, partially offset by lower raw material and transportation costs. See the “Segment Review” below for additional information on gross profit by segment. Gross profit margin was 19.8 percent and 18.5 percent for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $139.4 million for the first quarter of 2023 and $151.6 million for the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to incentive compensation expense reduction. SG&A expenses were 11.0 percent and 9.7 percent of net sales for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Financial Measures Operating profit was $156.4 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $72.0 million for the first quarter of 2022. Net income was $93.1 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $18.6 million for the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $164.5 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $196.8 million for the first quarter of 2022. The reasons for the changes in operating profit, net income, and Adjusted EBITDA for each segment are described below in the “Segment Review.” Trends We anticipate that the lower customer demand patterns that we experienced during the first quarter will continue through our second quarter, subject to normal seasonal increases. We expect that steel and resin prices have reached lows and may start to trend upward, but we do not expect material inflationary trends to return during the second quarter. We expect the weakness in old corrugated container pricing to continue through the second quarter. Transportation, labor, and utilities are expected to remain relatively stable through the second quarter. Segment Review Global Industrial Packaging Our Global Industrial Packaging segment offers a comprehensive line of industrial packaging products, such as steel, fibre and plastic drums, rigid intermediate bulk containers, jerrycans and other small plastics, closure systems for industrial packaging products, transit protection products, water bottles and remanufactured and reconditioned industrial containers, and services, such as container life cycle management, filling, logistics, warehousing and other packaging services. Key factors influencing profitability in the Global Industrial Packaging segment are: • Selling prices, product mix, customer demand and sales volumes; • Raw material costs, primarily steel, resin, containerboard and used industrial packaging for reconditioning; • Energy and transportation costs; • Benefits from executing the Greif Business System; • Restructuring charges; • Acquisition of businesses and facilities; • Divestiture of businesses and facilities; and • Impact of foreign currency translation. Net sales were $705.8 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $949.1 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $243.3 million decrease was primarily due to the impact to net sales resulting from the FPS Divestiture, negative foreign currency translation impacts, and lower volumes and selling prices. Gross profit was $125.3 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $177.1 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $51.8 million decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the same factors that impacted net sales, partially offset by lower raw material, transportation, labor, utility and maintenance costs. Gross profit margin was 17.8 percent and 18.7 percent for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating profit was $45.9 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with operating profit of $31.0 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $14.9 million increase was primarily due to the $62.4 million non-cash impairment charge during the first quarter of 2022 related to the FPS Divestiture, partially offset by the same factors that impacted gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $71.8 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $114.2 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $42.4 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the same factors that impacted gross profit, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense in SG&A. Paper Packaging & Services Our Paper Packaging & Services segment produces and sells containerboard, corrugated sheets, corrugated containers, and other corrugated products to customers in North America in industries such as packaging, automotive, food and building products. Our corrugated container products are used to ship such diverse products as home appliances, small machinery, grocery products, automotive components, books and furniture, as well as numerous other applications. We also produce and
32 Table of Contents sell coated recycled paperboard and uncoated recycled paperboard, some of which we use to produce and sell products (tubes and cores, construction products, and protective packaging), which ultimately serve both industrial and consumer markets. In addition, we purchase and sell recycled fiber, and we also produce and sell adhesives. Key factors influencing profitability in the Paper Packaging & Services segment are: • Selling prices, product mix, customer demand and sales volumes; • Raw material costs, primarily old corrugated containers; • Energy and transportation costs; • Benefits from executing the Greif Business System; • Restructuring charges; • Acquisition of businesses and facilities; and • Divestiture of businesses and facilities. Net sales were $560.2 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $610.0 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $49.8 million decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher published containerboard and boxboard prices. Gross profit was $124.2 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $110.8 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $13.4 million increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher published containerboard and boxboard prices, lower raw material, transportation, and labor costs, partially offset by lower volume and higher manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin was 22.2 percent and 18.2 percent for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating profit was $109.1 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $38.3 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $70.8 million increase was primarily due to the same factors that impacted gross profit and the $54.6 million gain from divestiture of Tama Paperboard, LLC in the Paper Packaging & Services segment (the “Tama Divestiture”) during the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $90.7 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $80.5 million for the first quarter of 2022. The $10.2 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the same factors that impacted gross profit. Land Management As of January 31, 2023, our Land Management segment consisted of approximately 175,000 acres of timber properties in the southeastern United States. Key factors influencing profitability in the Land Management segment are: • Planned level of timber sales; • Selling prices and customer demand; • Gains on timberland sales; and • Gains on the disposal of development, surplus and HBU properties (“special use property”). Net sales were $5.0 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2022.
Gross profit was $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $1.8 million for the first quarter of 2022.
Operating profit was $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.0 million and $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. In order to maximize the value of our timber property, we continue to review our current portfolio and explore the development of certain of these properties. This process has led us to characterize our property as follows: • Surplus property, meaning land that cannot be efficiently or effectively managed by us, whether due to parcel size, lack of productivity, location, access limitations or for other reasons; • HBU property, meaning land that in its current state has a higher market value for uses other than growing and selling timber; • Development property, meaning HBU land that, with additional investment, may have a significantly higher market value than its HBU market value; and • Core timberland, meaning land that is best suited for growing and selling timber. 33 Table of Contents We report the sale of core timberland property in timberland gains, the sale of HBU and surplus property in gain on disposal of properties, plants and equipment, net and the sale of timber and development property under net sales and cost of products sold in our interim condensed consolidated statements of income. All HBU and development property, together with surplus property, is used to productively grow and sell timber until the property is sold.
Whether timberland has a higher value for uses other than growing and selling timber is a determination based upon several variables, such as proximity to population centers, anticipated population growth in the area, the topography of the land, aesthetic considerations, including access to lakes or rivers, the condition of the surrounding land, availability of utilities, markets for timber and economic considerations both nationally and locally. Given these considerations, the characterization of land is not a static process, but requires an ongoing review and re-characterization as circumstances change. As of January 31, 2023, we had approximately 18,800 acres of special use property in the United States. Income Tax Expense Our quarterly income tax expense was computed in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740-270 “Income Taxes - Interim Reporting.” In accordance with this accounting standard, annual estimated tax expense is computed based on forecasted annual earnings and other forecasted annual amounts, including, but not limited to, items such as uncertain tax positions and withholding taxes. Additionally, losses from jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance has been provided have not been included in the annual estimated tax rate. Income tax expense each quarter is provided for on a current year-to-date basis using the annual estimated tax rate, adjusted for discrete taxable events that occur during the interim period. Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2023 was $37.7 million on $130.3 million of pretax income and income tax expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $35.6 million on $52.9 million of pretax income. The $2.1 million net increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to nondeductible goodwill associated with the Tama Divestiture, net of reduced tax expense on lower pre-tax book income excluding the book gain on the Tama Divestiture. Additionally, in 2022, a $62.4 million book impairment was recorded for the FPS Divestiture for which no tax benefit was recorded. We are subject to audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. The estimated net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for the next 12 months ranges from zero to $7.1 million. Actual results may differ materially from this estimate. 34 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and proceeds from our trade accounts receivable credit facilities. We use these sources to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, debt repayment and acquisitions. We anticipate continuing to fund these items in a like manner. We currently expect that operating cash flows, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and proceeds from our trade accounts receivable credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital, capital expenditures, cash dividends, debt repayment, potential acquisitions of businesses and other liquidity needs for at least 12 months. Cash Flow Three Months Ended January 31,
(in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 32.9  $ 22.4  Net cash used in investing activities (269.1) (45.8) Net cash provided by financing activities 239.5  54.0  Effects of exchange rates on cash 10.6  (18.6) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 13.9  12.0  Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 147.1  124.6  Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 161.0  $ 136.6  Operating Activities The $74.9 million decrease in accounts receivable to $674.2 million as of January 31, 2023 from $749.1 million as of October 31, 2022 was primarily due to lower average sale prices and lower volumes. The $37.8 million increase in inventories to $441.1 million as of January 31, 2023 from $403.3 million as of October 31, 2022 was primarily due to the inventories that were acquired through the Lee Container Acquisition. The $97.3 million decrease in accounts payable to $464.0 million as of January 31, 2023 from $561.3 million as of October 31, 2022 was primarily due to the decrease in raw material prices and timing of payable settlements. Investing Activities During the first three months of 2023 and 2022, we invested $49.3 million and $44.5 million, respectively, of cash in capital expenditures. During the first three months of 2023, we paid $301.9 million for purchases of business, net of cash acquired, primarily for the Lee Container Acquisition. During the first three months of 2023, we received $105.6 million of cash from sale of businesses, primarily from the Tama Divestiture. Financing Activities During the first three months of 2023 and 2022, we paid cash dividends to stockholders of Greif, Inc. in the amount of $28.9 million and $27.2 million, respectively. We borrowed $298.0 million of long-term debt, net of proceeds, for the first three months of 2023 and issued $90.2 million of long-term debt, net of payments, for the first three months of 2022. During the first three months of 2023, we paid $17.8 million for the share repurchase program. Stock Repurchase Program In June 2022, the Stock Repurchase Committee of our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of shares of our Class A or Class B Common Stock or any combination thereof. On June 23, 2022, we entered into a $75.0 million accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with Bank of America, N.A. for the repurchase of shares of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, we plan to repurchase an aggregate of $75.0 million of shares of our Class A or Class B Common Stock, or any combination thereof, in open market purchases (“OSR program”). Under the ASR, on June 24, 2022, we made a payment of $75.0 million and received an initial delivery of approximately 80% of the expected share repurchases, or 1,021,451 shares of Class A Common Stock, with any remaining shares expected to be delivered by the end of our second quarter 2023. The final number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR less a discount. We have treated the shares of Class A Common Stock delivered as treasury shares as of the date the shares were physically delivered in computing the weighted average shares outstanding of Class A Common Stock for both basic and
35 Table of Contents diluted earnings per share. The forward stock purchase contract was determined to be indexed to our own stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification. We settled the ASR and received the remaining shares of Class A Common Stock at February 28, 2023. We began making repurchases of Class B Common Stock under the OSR program on September 9, 2022, and we may continue to make open market repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months under this program, all in accordance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing of any such repurchases will depend on market conditions and will be made at our discretion. While we intend to repurchase up to $75.0 million of shares, we are not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or number or class of shares and may suspend or discontinue repurchases at any time. As of January 31, 2023, 402,926 shares of Class B Common Stock had been repurchased under the OSR program. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding this program and the repurchase of shares of Class A and B Common Stock. Financial Obligations Borrowing Arrangements Long-term debt is summarized as follows: (in millions) January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 2022 Credit Agreement - Term Loans $ 1,554.4  $ 1,565.0  Accounts receivable credit facilities 325.8  311.4  2022 Credit Agreement - Revolving Credit Facility 352.0  41.9  Other debt 0.2  0.4  2,232.4  1,918.7  Less: current portion 80.8  71.1  Less: deferred financing costs 7.7  8.3  Long-term debt, net $ 2,143.9  $ 1,839.3  2022 Credit Agreement On March 1, 2022, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a second amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the “2022 Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of financial institutions. The 2022 Credit Agreement amended, restated and replaced in its entirety our previous credit agreement, referred to as the “2019 Credit Agreement”. The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for (a) an $800.0 million secured revolving credit facility, consisting of a $725.0 million multicurrency facility and a $75.0 million U.S. dollar facility, maturing on March 1, 2027, (b) a $1,100 million secured term loan A-1 facility with quarterly principal installments that commenced on July 31, 2022 and continue through January 31, 2027, with any outstanding principal balance of such term loan A-1 facility being due and payable on maturity on March 1, 2027, and (c) a $515.0 million secured term loan A-2 facility with quarterly principal installments that commenced on July 31, 2022 and continue through January 31, 2027, with any outstanding principal balance of such term loan A-2 being due and payable on maturity on March 1, 2027. The term loan A-2 facility reflects the combination of the outstanding balances of the secured term A-2 and A-3 loans under the 2019 Credit Agreement.
The repayment of this facility is secured by a security interest in our personal property and the personal property of certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, including equipment and inventory and certain intangible assets, as well as a pledge of the capital stock of substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries, and is secured, in part, by the capital stock of the non-U.S. borrowers. However, in the event that we receive and maintain an investment grade rating from either Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, we may request the release of such collateral. Interest is based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a credit spread adjustment, Euro Interbank Offer Rate (“EURIBOR”) or a base rate that resets periodically plus, in each case, a calculated margin amount that is based on our leverage ratio. Subject to the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement, we have an option to add borrowings to the 2022 Credit Agreement with the agreement of the lenders. As of January 31, 2023, we had $448.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the $800.0 million secured revolving credit facility. 36 Table of Contents The 2022 Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, which include financial covenants that require us to maintain a certain leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The leverage ratio generally requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of (a) our total consolidated indebtedness (less the aggregate amount of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents), to (b) our consolidated net income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization, interest expense (including capitalized interest), income taxes, and minus certain extraordinary gains and non-recurring gains (or plus certain extraordinary losses and non-recurring losses) and plus or minus certain other items for the preceding twelve months (as used in this paragraph only “EBITDA”) to be greater than 4.00 to 1.00; provided that such leverage ratio is subject to (i) a covenant step-up (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) increase adjustment of 0.50 upon the consummation of, and the following three fiscal quarters after, certain specified acquisitions, and (ii) a collateral release decrease adjustment of 0.25x during any collateral release period (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement). The interest coverage ratio generally requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of (a) our consolidated EBITDA, to (b) our consolidated interest expense to the extent paid or payable, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00, during the applicable preceding twelve-month period. As of January 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.
United States Trade Accounts Receivable Credit Facility We have a $300.0 million U.S. Receivables Facility, as defined in Note 4 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which matures on May 17, 2023. As of January 31, 2023, there was $247.1 million outstanding balance under the U.S. Receivables Facility that is reported as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets because we intend to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis and have the intent and ability to consummate a long-term refinancing by renewing the existing agreement or entering into new financing arrangements. The U.S. Receivables Facility also contains events of default and covenants, which are substantially the same as the covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement. As of January 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. Proceeds of the U.S. Receivables Facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. International Trade Accounts Receivable Credit Facilities We have a €100.0 million ($108.7 million as of January 31, 2023) European Receivables Financing Agreement (the “European RFA”), as defined in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which matures on April 24, 2023. The $78.7 million outstanding on the European RFA as of January 31, 2023 is reported as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets because we intend to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis and have the intent and ability to consummate a long-term refinancing by renewing the existing agreement or entering into new financing arrangements. As of January 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. Proceeds of the European RFA are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. See Note 4 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional disclosures regarding our financial instruments. Financial Instruments Interest Rate Derivatives As of January 31, 2023, we have various interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1,300.0 million, amortizing down over the term, in which we receive variable interest rate payments based on SOFR and in return are obligated to pay interest at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.62%, plus a spread. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and will mature between March 11, 2024 and July 15, 2029. Accordingly, the gain or loss on these derivative instruments is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transactions and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign Exchange Hedges We conduct business in international currencies and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. Our objective is to reduce volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on business operations. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of certain existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency cash flows. As of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts in the notional amount of $135.7 million, and $132.1 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Cross Currency Swap We have operations and investments in various international locations and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. We have cross currency interest rate swaps that synthetically swap $334.4 million of fixed rate debt to Euro denominated fixed rate debt. We receive a weighted average rate of 1.56%. These agreements are designated either net investment hedges or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and will mature between March 6, 2023 and October 5, 2026.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on the net investment hedge derivative instruments is included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income until the net investment is sold, diluted, or liquidated. The gain or loss on the cash flow hedge derivative instruments is included in the unrealized foreign exchange component of other expense, offset by the underlying gain or loss on the underlying cash flows that are being hedged. Interest payments received from the cross currency swap are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 5 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional disclosures regarding our financial instruments. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no significant changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about our market risk from the disclosures contained in the 2022 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company completed the Lee Container Acquisition
on
December 15, 2022 .
The scope of the Company’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2023, will not include the Lee Container Acquisition. This exclusion is in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the Company’s scope in the year of acquisition. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Disclosure Controls and Procedures With the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report: • Information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; • Information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and • Our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
39 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in the 2022 Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A –– Risk Factors. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS (c.) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer In June 2022, the Stock Repurchase Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of shares of the Company’s Class A or Class B Common Stock or any combination thereof. On June 23, 2022, the Company entered into a $75.0 million accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with Bank of America, N.A. for the repurchase of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. In addition, the Company plans to repurchase an aggregate of $75.0 million of shares of its Class A or Class B Common Stock, or any combination thereof, in open market purchases (“OSR program”).
Under the ASR, on June 24, 2022, the Company made a payment of $75.0 million and received an initial delivery of approximately 80% of the expected share repurchases, or 1,021,451 shares of Class A Common Stock, with any remaining shares expected to be delivered by the end of the Company’s second quarter 2023. The final number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR less a discount. The Company began making repurchases of Class B Common Stock under the OSR program on September 9, 2022, and the Company may continue to make open market repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months under this program, all in accordance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing of any such repurchases will depend on market conditions and will be made at the Company’s discretion. While the Company intends to repurchase up to $75.0 million of shares, it is not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or number or class of shares and may suspend or discontinue repurchases at any time. As of January 31, 2023, 402,926 shares of Class B Common Stock had been repurchased under the OSR program. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding this program and the repurchase of shares of Class A and B Common Stock.
