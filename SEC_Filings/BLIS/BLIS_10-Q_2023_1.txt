1. Financial Statements
The

Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

considered necessary to present fairly the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company for the interim
periods presented.

Treasure

NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
January
31, 2023
Note
1 –
ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
Treasure
& Shipwreck Recovery, Inc (“TSR” or the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24,
2016 as Beliss Corp. The Company changed its name to Treasure & Shipwreck Recovery Inc. on June 26, 2019.
TSR
formed TSR Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, on August 22, 2019 as the Company’s operating vehicle to focus on the recovery
of sunken treasure from historic shipwrecks. The Company was originally focused on the development of high impact internet marketing,
search engine optimization (“SEO”) software and techniques, and the development of digital properties (collectively “Internet
Marketing”).
On
April 6, 2020, TSR formed TSR Media Group, Inc. (“TSR Media”), a wholly owned subsidiary, in order to develop various digital
media properties. TSR Media is in the process of developing, through an outside app developer, a treasure search and salvage gaming app.
Note
2 –
GOING CONCERN
These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realize its
assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred net losses
since inception, which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company had no
cash at January 31, 2023. Based on its historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than
three months from March 21, 2023. Management’s plans include raising capital through the equity markets to fund operations and,
eventually, the generation of revenue through its business. The Company does not expect to generate any significant revenues for the
foreseeable future. At January 31, 2023, the Company had net working capital deficit of $998,881. The Company is in immediate need of
further working capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof.
Failure
to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. The Company’s
ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of the common stock is unknown. Additionally, even if the Company does
raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue
will be sufficient to enable it to develop to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; however, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of
the recorded assets or the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
Management
acknowledges its responsibility for the preparation of the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements which reflect all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary in its opinion for a fair statement of its financial position and the
results of its operations for the interim period presented. These consolidated unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the summary of significant accounting policies and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s
Form 10-K annual report for the year ended April 30, 2022. The results of the nine months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending April 30, 2023.
8
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of TSR Holdings, Inc. and TSR Media, which are wholly owned subsidiaries.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Estimates
The
process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding
certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Significant estimates for the nine month periods ended January 31, 2023
and 2022 include the useful life of property and equipment, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and fair value of non cash
equity transactions.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
There
were no cash equivalents at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) up to $ 250,000 . As of January 31, 2023, the Company had $ 0
in excess of the FDIC insured limit.
Research
and Development Expenses
Expenditures
for research and development are expensed as incurred.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606,
Revenue from contracts with
customers . The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
An entity recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract(s)
with a customer, Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract, Step 3: Determine the transaction price, Step 4: Allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies
a performance obligation. Specifically, Section 606-10-50 requires an entity to provide information about: a. Revenue recognized from
contracts with customers, including the disaggregation of revenue into appropriate categories; b. Contract balances, including the opening
and closing balances of receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities; c. Performance obligations, including when the entity
typically satisfies its performance obligations and the transaction price that is allocated to the remaining performance obligations
in a contract; and d. Significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the requirements to those contracts.
The
Company offers no discounts, rebates, rights of return, or other allowances to clients which would result in the establishment of reserves
against service revenue. Additionally, to date, the Company has not incurred incremental costs in obtaining a client contract.
Basic
Loss per Share
The
Company has adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) ASC 260-10, which provides for the calculation of “basic”
and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or
loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity.
The
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents for the periods ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were excluded from the dilutive loss
per share calculation as they would be antidilutive due to the net loss. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, there were approximately
10,349,827
and
8,074,096
shares of common stock underlying our outstanding convertible notes payable and warrants,
respectively.
9
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable, short term loans, and the Company’s related
party loan from a shareholder approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Fixed
Assets
Fixed
assets are recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets. Gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of disposition. Maintenance
and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Currently the Company’s only assets are a diving vessel and a magnetometer
which were purchased in fiscal year 2020 and are being depreciated over three to twelve year useful lives.
Impairment
of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. When impairment
indicators exist, the Company uses market quotes, if available or an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related
asset or asset group over the remaining life in measuring whether or not the asset values are recoverable. Identified intangible assets
are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not
be recoverable.
Stock
Based Compensation to Employees and Service Providers
The
Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees and service providers, including grants of employee stock options, as compensation
expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee
is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) or immediately
if the share-based payments vest immediately.
Convertible
Notes Payable
The
Company accounts for convertible notes deemed conventional and conversion options embedded in non-conventional convertible notes which
qualify as equity under ASC 815, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 470-20, which provides guidance on accounting for convertible
securities with beneficial conversion features. ASC 470-10 addresses classification determination for specific obligations, such as short-term
obligations expected to be refinanced on a long-term basis, due-on-demand loan arrangements, callable debt, sales of future revenue,
increasing rate debt, debt that includes covenants, revolving credit agreements subject to lock-box arrangements and subjective acceleration
clauses. Accordingly, the Company records, as a discount to convertible notes, the intrinsic value of such conversion options based upon
the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective
conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt.
Customer
Deposits
Customer
deposits discloses an amount paid by a customer prior to the Company providing it with goods or services. The Company has an obligation
to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money.
Income
Taxes
Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available
evidence, are not expected to be realized.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
All
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on
the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

on the intrinsic value at the date of issuance. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and year ended April 30, 2022, the Company
recognized beneficial conversion features totaling $0 and $479,579, respectively. The discount from the beneficial conversion features
are being amortized through charges to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes payable. The Company recorded interest
expense related to the amortization of debt discounts on these notes of $0 and $206,818 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively. The Company recorded interest expense related to the amortization of debt discounts on these notes of $ 21,114

On
December 6, 2021, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with a corporation. The note payable, with a face value of $70,666,
including a $17,666 original issue discount, bears interest at 0.0% per annum and is due on March 6, 2023. The default interest rate
is 15% if the note is not repaid within ninety days of the issue date, retroactive to the date of issuance. There was also $3,000 for
legal fees included in the note balance. After the occurrence of any event of default, the convertible note payable is convertible, at
the holder’s option, into the Company’s common shares at a fixed conversation rate of $0.10. The lender also received 282,667

price of the Company’s shares.
On
April 20, 2022, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with an individual who is a member of the Company’s Board of
Directors.  The note payable, with a face value of $50,000, bears interest at 10.0% per annum and is due on July 21, 2023.
The convertible note payable is convertible upon default, at the note holder’s option, into the Company’s common shares at
a fixed conversation rate of $0.05. The conversion of the note into shares of the Company’s common stock is potentially highly
dilutive to current shareholders. If the note holder elects to sell the shares that it has acquired as a result of converting the note
into shares of common stock, then any such sales may result in a significant decrease in the market price of the Company’s shares.
This convertible promissory note is currently in default due to non payment of principal and interest.

Description
of Business
Treasure
Shipwreck & Recovery, Inc. (“TSR”, “us,” “we,”, the “Company”) is focused, through
its wholly owned subsidiary TSR Holdings, Inc., on the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. The Company has acquired various
assets including a research vessel and specialized sensing equipment to be utilized to attempt to locate and eventually recover artifacts
and treasure from historic shipwrecks, generally from the colonial era. The Company has acquired the intellectual property rights in
a purchase agreement for the naming, trademark and use rights of Galleon Quest, from a third party to be used on Games and Apps, and
merchandising of products.
Legal
Proceedings
TSR
was served with a lawsuit in the lesser county court in Hillsborough County, Florida, served on February 1, 2023, over a claimed fee
by Dalmore Group, LLC for a claim of fees of a limited amount of $20,000, Dalmore was contracted by TSR to perform services to TSR in
regard to the offering and processing for TSR’s REG A offering. However, after contracting Dalmore, and TSR paying the initial
fees of some $5,950. TSR chose not to continue with their services, and communicated an end to such agreement. Dalmore apparently failed
to acknowledge such termination, even though they did not provide any services at all for TSR. TSR has filed a motion to dismiss such
lawsuit on numerous grounds. TSR does not believe the lawsuit to have merit and is not material to its operations and financial condition.
There are no other threated or other legal proceedings for TSR.
COVID-19
Pandemic Threat and Continuity Plan
Due
to current events involving the global COVID-19 pandemic, TSR, under the guidance of its President, is reviewing procedures to monitor
current events as they relate to our business and to be prepared to respond to any potential threats or issues in order to protect the
Company and its assets. We are also in the process of reviewing plans to locate a back office for our corporate records and information
at a location to be designated so that in the event that access to the Company’s offices are restricted, the Company is able to
continue with its business and operations.
The
Company’s operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was declared
a pandemic by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) in March 2020. The ultimate disruption which may be caused by the outbreak
is uncertain; however, it may result in a material adverse impact on the TSR’s financial position, operations and cash flows.
Possible
effects may include, but are not limited to, disruption to the Company’s operations, inability of management team members and other
key personnel and consultants to provide services or provide services in a timely manner, unavailability of equipment, parts and supplies
used in operations, lack of access to maintenance and repair facilities for the Company’s salvage vessel, and a decline in the
value of the Company’s assets including its salvage vessel, equipment and its digital properties.
Additionally,
it is possible that the Company is not able to obtain financing due to COVID-19’s effects on the general economy and the capital
markets. If the Company is not able to obtain financing due to COVID-19 then it is highly likely that it will be forced to cease its
operations. The impact of smaller companies such as TSR having to cease operations due to effects of COVID-19 would likely result in
the Company not being able to survive and would cause a complete loss of all capital invested in the Company.
Results
of operations
We
have incurred recurring losses to date. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will
continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.
We
will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other
things, the sale of equity or debt securities. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital.
The Company had $0 cash at January 31, 2023. Based on its historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available
cash in less than one month from March 21, 2023.

weather.
Other
Income (Expenses)

amortization in 2021 than in 2022.
16
Net

the three month period ended January 31, 2023 the Company incurred net losses of $13,966 versus losses of $222,525 for the three month
period ended January 31, 2022. The decreased net loss is a result of decreased interest expense in the three months ended January 31,
2023. The decrease in net losses for the period ended January 31, 2023 was due to decreased interest expense versus the three month period
ended January 31, 2022.
Liquidity

and 2022.
Cash
flows from financing activities

For
the nine month period ended January 31, 2022 cash flows provided by financing activities were $413,000.
The
decrease in cash provided by financing activities is attributable to increased proceeds from the sale of convertible loans for the nine
month period ended January 31, 2022.
We
qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
from certain disclosure requirements.
For
example, smaller reporting companies are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation
S-K or the auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting.
Future
Financings
We
will continue to rely on equity sales of the Company’s common shares in order to continue to fund business operations. Issuances
of additional shares will result in dilution to existing shareholders. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve any additional
sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned operations. Future financing activities involving the
sale of common stock under subscription agreements or entering into convertible promissory note agreements may cause substantial dilution
to current shareholders. The Company currently has an active Reg-A for a financial raise.
17
Liquidity
and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements
As
of the date of this report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status.
At January 31, 2023, the Company had $0 cash and a working capital deficit of $998,881. The Company is in immediate need of further working
capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. Based on its historical
rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than three months from March 17, 2023.
The
Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent auditors for the year ended April 30, 2022 raises
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is
highly likely that all capital invested in the Company will be lost.
Management
believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company’s
success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting
requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on
policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement
its business plan and impede the speed of its operations.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s
Responsibility for Controls and Procedures
The
Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company’s financial
reporting. The Company’s controls over financial reporting are designed under the supervision of the Company’s President
and Principal Financial Officer to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is accumulated and communicated to
the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, as of January 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize and reporting of financial information required to be included on our Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports due to the Company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have
multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the consolidated
financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.
Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting
As
of January 31, 2023, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and based on the criteria for effective internal control described in
Internal Control –
Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (as revised). Based on our evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize
and reporting of financial information required to be included on our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports
due to the Company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. However, as
a result of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and other information presented
herewith are materially correct.
The
management including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures,
or its internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of the control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative
to their costs.
Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
The
Company has limited resources and as a result, a material weakness in financial reporting currently exists, because of our limited resources
and personnel, including those described below.
*
The
Company has an insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal
controls. As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and annual consolidated financial statements could occur and not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.
*
We
have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions.
*
We
do not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee financial expert. While not being legally obligated to have an audit
committee or independent audit committee financial expert, it is managements view that to have an audit committee, comprised of independent
board members, and an independent audit committee financial expert is an important entity-level control over the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.
A
material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) auditing standard 5) or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
has determined that a material weakness exists due to a lack of segregation of duties, resulting from the Company’s limited resources
and personnel.
19
Remediation
Efforts to Address Deficiencies in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
As
a result of these findings, management, upon obtaining sufficient capital and operations, intends to take practical, cost-effective steps
in implementing internal controls, including the possible remedial measures set forth below. As of January 31, 2023, we did not have
sufficient capital and/or operations to implement any of the remedial measures described below.
*
Assessing
the current duties of existing personnel and consultants, assigning additional duties to existing personnel and consultants, and,
in a cost effective manner, potentially hiring additional personnel to assist with the preparation of the Company’s financial
statements to allow for proper segregation of duties, as well as additional resources for control documentation.
*
Assessing
the duties of the existing officers of the Company and, in a cost effective manner, possibly promote or hire additional personnel
to diversify duties and responsibilities of such executive officers.
*
Board
to review and make recommendations to shareholders concerning the composition of the Board of Directors, with particular focus on
issues of independence. The Board of Directors will consider nominating an audit committee and audit committee financial expert,
which may or may not consist of independent members.
*
Interviewing
and potentially hiring outside consultants that are experts in designing internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) (as revised).
This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this quarterly report.
(b)
Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The
Company has not made any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine month period ended January 31, 2023.
