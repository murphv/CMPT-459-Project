NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, accordingly, do not include all information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 3, 2022 , previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position and the results of our operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All adjustments made to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements were of a normal recurring nature. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for the nine months ended January 1, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. References to fiscal 2022 refer to the fiscal year ended April 3, 2022 and references to fiscal 2023 refer to the fiscal year ending April 2, 2023.
Use of Estimates.
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, particularly receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, intangibles, accrued expenses, short-term and long-term lease liability, income taxes and related accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounting Policies.
The accounting policies we follow are set forth in Note 1 – Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 3, 2022 , previously filed with the SEC. There has been no significant change in our accounting policies since the end of fiscal 2022.   Note 2 —

Revenue
Our revenue arrangements generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods or services. We disaggregate revenues from contracts with customers by operating segments as well as types of products sold. Reporting by operating segment is pertinent to understanding our revenues, as it aligns to how we review the financial performance of our operations. Types of products sold within each operating segment help us to further evaluate the financial performance of our segments.

Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS includes the dilutive impact of incremental shares assumed to be issued as performance units and restricted stock.
Basic and diluted EPS were calculated using the following:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 01, 2023 December 26, 2021 January 01, 2023 December 26, 2021 Weighted-average common shares outstanding—basic 20,818,347   20,885,232   20,847,285   20,968,692   Dilutive impact of performance units and restricted stock 155,917   169,371   157,564   173,823   Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 20,974,264   21,054,603   21,004,849   21,142,515   For each of the periods presented, there were
no
shares excluded from the calculation of weighted-average common shares for diluted EPS. Note 5 –
Fair Value Measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Because of the variable-rate nature of our debt under our credit facility, our debt also approximates fair value. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis.   The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.
Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are an interest rate swap and assets held in a deferred compensation retirement plan. Both of these assets are classified as long-term assets on our balance sheet, with the portion of the deferred compensation retirement plan assets expected to be paid within twelve months classified as current assets. The fair value of the interest rate swap is determined by the respective counterparties based on interest rate changes. Interest rate swaps are valued based on observable interest rate yield curves for similar instruments. The deferred compensation plan assets relate to contributions made to a non-qualified compensation plan on behalf of certain employees who are classified as “highly compensated employees” as determined by IRS guidelines. The assets are part of a rabbi trust and the funds are held in mutual funds. The fair value of the deferred compensation is based on the quoted market prices for the mutual funds at the end of the period. The following tables summarize the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 1, 2023 and April 3, 2022.

Share-Based Compensation
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units .
Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a performance-based equity compensation arrangement for our executive officers during the first quarters of each of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. These performance-based arrangements provide for the grant of performance-based restricted stock units that represent a possible future issuance of restricted shares of our common stock based on a pre-tax income target for the applicable fiscal year. The actual number of restricted shares to be issued to each executive officer is determined when our final financial information becomes available after the applicable fiscal year and will be between
zero
shares and
76,863
shares in the aggregate for fiscal 2023. The restricted shares issued, if any, will fully vest approximately two years after the last day of the fiscal year on which the performance is based. We are recording the compensation expense for the outstanding performance share units and the converted restricted stock over the life of the awards.
The following table represents the restricted stock activity for the nine months ended January 1, 2023:

We recorded compensation expense for both the nine months ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021 related to performance share units and restricted stock of $ 2.0  million. Substantially all of the compensation expense was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Restricted Stock Awards .
As part of their retainer, our non-employee directors receive restricted stock for their Board services. The restricted stock awards are generally expensed over a one-year vesting period, based on the market value on the date of grant. As of January 1, 2023, there were
12,565
shares of restricted stock with an average grant date fair value of $ 38.98
outstanding under this program. Compensation expense for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2023 related to restricted stock awards to the Board was $ 0.1
million and $ 0.3  million, respectively. Compensation expense for the three and nine months ended December 26, 2021 related to restricted stock awards to the Board was $ 0.1  million and $ 0.2  million, respectively.

Segment Information We have
three
reportable segments: Industrial, Water Treatment, and Health and Nutrition. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 3, 2022 .
We evaluate performance based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses. Reportable segments are defined primarily by product and type of customer. Segments are responsible for the sales, marketing and development of their products and services. We allocate certain corporate expenses to our operating segments. There are
no
intersegment sales and
no
operating segments have been aggregated.
No
single customer’s revenues amounted to 10% or more of our total revenue. Sales are primarily within the United States and all assets are located within the United States.   (In thousands) Industrial Water Treatment Health and Nutrition Total Three months ended January 1, 2023: Sales $ 114,436   $ 68,549   $ 36,233   $ 219,218   Gross profit 15,994   13,268   7,009   36,271   Selling, general, and administrative expenses 7,978   9,003   4,023   21,004   Operating income 8,016   4,265   2,986   15,267   Three months ended December 26, 2021: Sales $ 100,554   $ 49,756   $ 36,740   $ 187,050   Gross profit 15,303   11,103   7,534   33,940   Selling, general, and administrative expenses 7,367   8,254   4,060   19,681   Operating income

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Item 8 of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 3, 2022 . Overview We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of chemicals and specialty ingredients to our customers in a wide variety of industries. We began our operations primarily as a distributor of bulk chemicals with a strong customer focus. Over the years, we have maintained the strong customer focus and have expanded our business by increasing our sales of value-added chemicals and specialty ingredients, including manufacturing, blending, and repackaging certain products.
Business Acquisitions In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired substantially all the assets of NAPCO Chemical Company, Inc. and its affiliates ("NAPCO") under the terms of an asset purchase agreement among us, NAPCO and certain other parties thereto. NAPCO manufactured and distributed water treatment chemicals from three locations in Texas. The results of operations since the acquisition date are included in our Water Treatment segment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired substantially all the assets of Water and Waste Specialties, LLC, under the terms of an asset purchase agreement with Water and Waste Specialties and its shareholders. Water and Waste Specialties was a water treatment chemical distribution company operating primarily in Alabama. The results of operations since the acquisition date are included in our Water Treatment segment. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired substantially all the assets of Southeast Water Systems LLC, under the terms of an asset purchase agreement with Southeast Water Systems and its shareholders. Southeast Water Systems supplied and installed water treatment chemical equipment to its customers located primarily in Alabama, southern Georgia and the Florida panhandle. The results of operations since the acquisition date are included in our Water Treatment segment. The aggregate annual revenue of the three businesses acquired in fiscal 2022 totaled approximately $17 million, as determined using the applicable twelve-month period preceding each respective acquisition date. Share Repurchase Program On August 4, 2022, our Board increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased under our share repurchase program from 1.6 million to 2.6 million. As of January 1, 2023, 1,129,348 shares remain available to be repurchased under this program. Financial Results We focus on total profitability dollars when evaluating our financial results as opposed to profitability as a percentage of sales, as sales dollars tend to fluctuate, particularly in our Industrial and Water Treatment segments, as raw material costs rise and fall. The costs for certain of our raw materials can rise or fall rapidly, causing fluctuations in gross profit as a percentage of sales. We use the LIFO method for valuing the majority of our inventory in our Industrial and Water Treatment segments, which causes the most recent product costs for those products to be recognized in our income statement. The valuation of LIFO inventory for interim periods is based on our estimates of fiscal year-end inventory levels and costs. The LIFO inventory valuation method and the resulting cost of sales are consistent with our business practices of pricing to current chemical raw material prices. Inventories in the Health and Nutrition segment are valued using the FIFO method.
We disclose the sales of our bulk commodity products as a percentage of total sales dollars for our Industrial and Water Treatment segments. Our definition of bulk commodity products includes products that we do not modify in any way, but receive, store, and ship from our facilities, or direct ship to our customers in large quantities.
Results of Operations The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to sales for the period indicated:     Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 1, 2023 December 26, 2021 January 1, 2023 December 26, 2021 Sales 100.0  % 100.0  % 100.0  % 100.0  % Cost of sales (83.5) % (81.9) % (81.7) % (80.0) % Gross profit 16.5  % 18.1  % 18.3  % 20.0  % Selling, general and administrative expenses (9.6) % (10.5) % (8.4) % (9.8) % Operating income 6.9  % 7.6  % 9.9  % 10.2  % Interest expense, net (0.7) % (0.2) % (0.5) % (0.2) % Other (expense) income 0.2  % 0.1  % (0.1) % 0.1  % Income before income taxes 6.4  % 7.5  % 9.3  % 10.1  % Income tax expense (1.6) % (2.1) % (2.4) % (2.6) % Net income 4.8  % 5.4  % 6.9  % 7.5  % Three Months Ended January 1, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended December 26, 2021
Sales Sales were $219.2 million for the three months ended January 1, 2023, an increase of $32.1 million, or 17%, from sales of $187.1 million in the same period a year ago, driven primarily by increased selling prices.

Gross Profit Gross profit increased $2.4 million, or 7%, to $36.3 million, or 17% of sales, for the three months ended January 1, 2023, from $33.9 million, or 18% of sales, in the same period a year ago. During the three months ended January 1, 2023, the LIFO reserve increased, and gross profit decreased, by $3.7 million due primarily to rising raw material costs. In the same quarter a year ago, the LIFO reserve increased, and gross profit decreased, by $2.9 million. Gross profit increased due to increased revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year impact of the increased LIFO reserve. Industrial Segment.
Gross profit for the Industrial segment increased $0.7 million, or 5%, to $16.0 million, or 14% of sales, for the three months ended January 1, 2023, from $15.3 million, or 15% of sales, in the same period a year ago.

In the same quarter a year ago, the LIFO reserve increased, and gross profit decreased, by $2.2 million. Gross profit increased as a result of increased sales as well as improved unit margins on many of our products.
Water Treatment Segment.
Gross profit for the Water Treatment segment increased $2.2 million, or 20%, to $13.3 million, or 19% of sales, for the three months ended January 1, 2023, from $11.1 million, or 22% of sales, in the same period a year ago.

Operating Income Operating income increased $1.0 million, or 7%, to $15.3 million, or 7% of sales, for the three months ended January 1, 2023, from $14.3 million, or 8% of sales, in the same period a year ago due to the combined impact of the factors discussed above. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense was $1.5 million for the three months ended January 1, 2023 and $0.3 million the same period a year ago. The increase was due to an increase in borrowing interest rates as well as an increase in outstanding borrowings due to increased working capital needs.
Other (Expense) Income Other income was $0.5 million for the three months ended January 1, 2023 and $0.1 million in the same period a year ago. The income represents gains recorded on investments held for our non-qualified deferred compensation plan.

Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate was 24% for the three months ended January 1, 2023 and 27% the three months ended December 26, 2021. The effective tax rate decreased from the prior year due to favorable tax provision adjustments recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate is impacted by projected levels of annual taxable income, permanent items, and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the full year is currently expected to be approximately 26 to 27%. Nine Months Ended January 1, 2023 Compared to Nine Months Ended December 26, 2021

Interest Expense, Net Interest expense was $3.9 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2023 and $1.0 million for the same period a year ago. The increase was due to an increase in borrowing interest rates as well as an increase in outstanding borrowings due to increased working capital needs.
Other (Expense) Income Other expense was $0.7 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2023 compared to other income of $0.5 million in the same period a year ago.

Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate was 26% for both the nine months ended January 1, 2023 and in the same period a year ago. The effective tax rate is impacted by projected levels of annual taxable income, permanent items, and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the full year is currently expected to be approximately 26 to 27%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash was $6.1 million at January 1, 2023, an increase of $2.7 million as compared with the $3.5 million available as of April 3, 2022. Cash provided by operating activities was $44.5 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2023, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $38.7 million in the same period a year ago. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increased net income. Due to the nature of our operations, which includes purchases of large quantities of bulk chemicals, timing of purchases can result in significant changes in working capital investment and the resulting operating cash flow.
Cash used in investing activities was $32.0 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2023, compared to $18.0 million in the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures were $32.3 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2023, compared to $15.7 million in the same period a year ago. In the first nine months of the current year, we invested nearly $4 million on rail expansion projects at three of our facilities, an additional $1.1 million to complete an expansion of our Illinois manufacturing facility, purchased a previously leased facility for $0.9 million, and had larger investments in trucks, safety equipment and new and replacement equipment compared to the first nine months of the prior year. Cash provided by financing activities was $9.9 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2023, compared to $0.2 million of cash used in financing activities in the same period a year ago. Included in financing activities in the first nine months of the current year were net debt proceeds of $5.0 million, compared to net debt proceeds of $17.0 million in the first nine months of the prior year. In addition, we repurchased $6.6 million of shares of our common stock in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, compared to $8.5 million of shares repurchased in the same period a year ago. We expect our cash balances and funds available under our credit facility, discussed below, along with cash flows generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements of our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future.
Our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to 2.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock. The shares may be purchased on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to applicable securities laws and regulations. The primary objective of the share repurchase program is to offset the impact of dilution from issuances relating to employee and director equity grants and our employee stock purchase program. During the nine months ended January 1, 2023, we repurchased 181,657 shares of common stock with an aggregate purchase price of $6.6 million. During the nine months ended December 26, 2021, 240,501 shares were repurchased with an aggregate purchase price of $8.5 million. As of January 1, 2023, 1,129,348 shares remained available to be repurchased under the share repurchase program.
We are party to a second amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), whereby U.S. Bank is also serving as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement refinanced the revolving loan under our previous credit agreement with U.S. Bank and provides us with senior secured revolving credit facilities (the “Revolving Loan Facility”) totaling $250 million. The Revolving Loan Facility includes a $10 million letter of credit subfacility and $25 million swingline subfacility. The Revolving Loan Facility has a five-year maturity date, maturing on April 30, 2027. The Revolving Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property assets and those of our subsidiaries. We may use the amount available under the Revolving Loan Facility for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, restricted payments and acquisitions permitted under the Credit Agreement, and other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one of the following, plus, in both cases, an applicable margin based upon our leverage ratio: (a) Term SOFR, which includes a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, for an interest period of one, three or six months as selected by us, reset at the end of the selected interest period, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) U. S. Bank’s prime rate, (2) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or (3) one-month Term SOFR for U.S. dollars plus 1.0%. The Term SOFR margin is between 0.85% and 1.35%, depending on our leverage ratio. The base rate margin is between 0.00% and 0.35%, depending on our leverage ratio. At January 1, 2023, the effective interest rate on our borrowings was 4.2%. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Revolving Loan Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee is between 0.15% and 0.25%, depending on our leverage ratio. Debt issuance costs paid to the Lenders are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement. As of January 1, 2023, the unamortized balance of these costs was $0.4 million, and is reflected as a reduction of debt on our balance sheet. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 and (b) a maximum total cash flow leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of significant assets, make certain investments, including any acquisitions other than permitted acquisitions, make certain payments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, grant liens on our assets or enter into rate management transactions, subject to certain limitations. We are permitted to make distributions, pay dividends and repurchase shares so long as no default or event of default exists or would exist as a result thereof. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of January 1, 2023 and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants for the next 12 months. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including failure to comply with covenants in the Credit Agreement and other loan documents, cross default to other material indebtedness, failure by us to pay or discharge material judgments, bankruptcy, and change of control. The occurrence of an event of default would permit the lenders to terminate their commitments and accelerate loans under the Credit Facility. We have in place an interest rate swap agreement to manage the risk associated with a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. We do not utilize derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The interest rate swap involves the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated. The notional amount of the swap agreement is $60 million and it will terminate on May 1, 2027.
As part of our growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and may pursue acquisitions or other strategic relationships in the future that we believe will complement or expand our existing businesses or increase our customer base. We believe we could borrow additional funds under our current or new credit facilities or sell equity for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. Critical Accounting Estimates There were no material changes in our critical accounting estimates since the filing of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 3, 2022 . Forward-Looking Statements The information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements have been made pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections, and our beliefs and assumptions. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “will” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. These factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect future financial results is included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 3, 2022 . We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our management’s view only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We are not obligated to update these statements or publicly release the result of any revisions to them to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 13 ITEM 3.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to the risk inherent in the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices. However, we do not currently purchase forward contracts or otherwise engage in hedging activities with respect to the purchase of commodity chemicals. We attempt to pass changes in the cost of our materials to our customers. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to pass on the increases in the future. We are exposed to market risks related to interest rates. Our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily related to borrowings under our Revolving Loan Facility. We have in place an interest rate swap agreement to manage the risk associated with a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. The interest rate swap involves the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated. The notional amount of the swap agreement is $60.0 million and it will terminate on May 1, 2027. As of January 1, 2023, a 25-basis point change in interest rates on our unhedged variable-rate debt would potentially increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $0.2 million.
Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency risk, do not arise in the normal course of our business activities.
ITEM 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 1, 2023. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 14 PART II.
