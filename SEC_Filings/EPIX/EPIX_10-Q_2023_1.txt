Table of Contents CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and “forward-looking information” within the meaning of Canadian securities laws, or collectively, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements that may relate to our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenue or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs and other information that is not historical information. Many of these statements appear, in particular, under the headings “Business,” “Risk Factors,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of terminology such as “subject to”, “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “hope,” “can,” the negatives thereof, variations thereon and similar expressions, or by discussions of strategy. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Examples of such forward looking statements include, but are not limited to statements related to: ● our ability to maintain operations, development programs, preclinical studies, clinical trials and raise capital as a result of global macroeconomic factors including inflation, supply chain issues and any ongoing impact from the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak (“COVID 19”); ● our ability to advance our product candidate and potential future product candidates through, and successfully complete, clinical trials; ● our ability to recruit sufficient numbers of patients for future clinical trials, and the benefits expected therefrom; ● our ability to establish and maintain relationships with collaborators with acceptable development, regulatory and commercialization expertise and the benefits to be derived from such collaborative efforts; ● our ability to obtain funding for operations, including research funding, and the timing and potential sources of such funding; ● the initiation, timing, cost, location, progress and success of, strategy and plans with respect to our research and development programs (including research programs and related milestones with regards to next-generation drug candidates and compounds), preclinical studies and clinical trials; ● the therapeutic benefits, properties, effectiveness, pharmacokinetic profile and safety of our product candidate and potential future product candidates, if any, including the expected benefits, properties, effectiveness, pharmacokinetic profile and safety of our next-generation Aniten compounds; ● our ability to protect our intellectual property and operate our business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others;
● developments relating to our competitors and our industry, including the success of competing therapies that are or may become available; ● our ability to achieve profitability; ● the grant (“CPRIT Grant”) under the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (“CPRIT”) and payments thereunder, including any residual obligations; ● our intended use of proceeds from past and future offerings of our securities; ● the implementation of our business model and strategic plans, including strategic plans with respect to patent applications and strategic collaborations and partnerships; ● our ability to identify, develop and commercialize product candidates; ● our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy; ● our expectations regarding federal, state, provincial and foreign regulatory requirements, including our plans with respect to anticipated regulatory filings; ● whether we will receive, and the timing and costs of obtaining, regulatory approvals in the United States, Canada and other jurisdictions; ● the accuracy of our estimates of the size and characteristics of the markets that may be addressed by our product candidate and potential future product candidates, if any; ● the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our potential future product candidates, if any; 3
Table of Contents ● the timing of, and our ability and our collaborators’ ability, if any, to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our product candidate and potential future product candidates, if any; ● our expectations regarding market risk, including inflation, interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations; ● our ability to engage and retain the employees required to grow our business; ● the compensation that is expected to be paid to our employees; ● our future financial performance and projected expenditures; and ● estimates of our financial condition, expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and our need for additional financing and potential sources of capital and funding. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, are subject to risks and uncertainties and are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant medical, scientific, business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies. Many factors could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including those described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Certain assumptions made in preparing the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: ● our ability to maintain operations as a result of any ongoing impact from the COVID-19 outbreak; ● our ability to conduct a clinical study involving our product candidate and to identify any future product candidates; ● our ability to obtain regulatory and other approvals to commence a clinical trial involving any future product candidates; ● our ability to obtain positive results from research and development activities, including clinical trials; ● the availability of sufficient financing on reasonable terms; ● our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals; ● our ability to protect patents and proprietary rights; ● our ability to successfully out-license or sell future products, if any, and in-license and develop new products; ● the absence of material adverse changes in our industry or the global economy; ● our ability to attract and retain key personnel; ● our continued compliance with third party license terms and non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights; ● our ability to maintain good business relationships with our strategic partners; and ● our ability to understand and predict market competition. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our current expectations, views and assumptions, but they are inherently uncertain. We may not realize our expectations and our views and assumptions may not prove correct. Actual results could differ materially from those described or implied by such forward-looking statements.  In evaluating forward-looking statements, investors should specifically consider the following uncertainties and factors, among others (including those set forth under the heading “ Risk Factors ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K), that could affect future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by forward-looking statements RISK FACTOR SUMMARY Below is a summary of material factors that make an investment in our Common Shares (the “Common Shares”) speculative or risky. Importantly, this summary does not address all of the risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties summarized in this risk factor summary, as well as other risks and uncertainties that we face, can be found under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The below summary is qualified in its entirety by those more complete discussions of such risks and uncertainties. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as part of your evaluation of an investment in our Common Shares. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, the following: 4

● risks of a deemed default on any residual obligations of the agreement providing for the CPRIT Grant and having to reimburse all of the CPRIT Grant, if such deemed default is not waived by CPRIT; ● risks related to our incurrence of significant losses in every quarter since inception and our anticipation that it will continue to incur significant losses in the future; ● risks related to our limited operating history; ● risks related to our reliance on proprietary technology; ● risks related to our ability to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world; ● risks related to claims by third parties asserting that we, or our employees, contractors or consultants have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property; ● risks related to our ability to comply with governmental patent agency requirements in order to maintain patent protection; ● risks related to computer system failures or security breaches and increasing cyber threats; 5
Table of Contents ● risks related to business disruptions that could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses; ● risks related to our ability to attract and maintain highly qualified personnel; ● risks relating to the possibility that third-party coverage and reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues; ● risks related to potential conflicts of interest between us and our directors and officers; ● risks related to competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; ● risks related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and rate of inflation; ● risks related to our ability to convince public payors and hospitals to include our product candidate and potential future products, if any, on their approved formulary lists; ● risks related to our ability to establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure, or enter into acceptable third-party sales and marketing or licensing arrangements; ● risks related to our ability to manage growth; ● risks related to our ability to achieve or maintain expected levels of market acceptance for our products; ● risks related to our ability to realize benefits from acquired businesses or products or form strategic alliances in the future; ● risks related to collaborations with third parties; ● risks that employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation; ● risks related to product liability lawsuits; ● risks related to compulsory licensing and/or generic competition; ● risks related to being a smaller reporting company; ● risks related to share price volatility in the event there is low liquidity for the trading of the Company’s Common Shares; ● risks related to the possibility that laws and regulations governing international operations may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain product candidates outside of the United States and Canada and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs; ● risks related to laws that govern fraud and abuse and patients’ rights; ● risks related to our ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; ● risks related to us being a

● risks related to our ability to implement and maintain effective internal controls; ● risks related to provisions in our charter documents and Canadian law affecting corporate governance; and ● risks related to analyst coverage. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties or a risk that is not currently known to us, materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements represent our expectations, plans, estimates and views as of the date of this document. We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update, republish or revise forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrences of unanticipated events, except as required by law. Investors are cautioned that we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance or achievements and that forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We advise you that these cautionary remarks expressly qualify in their entirely all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. 6

Accordingly, these condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended September 30, 2022 and included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and with the securities commissions in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario on December 13, 2022. ​ These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results that can be expected for a full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements follow the same significant accounting policies as those described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, with the exception of any policies described in Note 3. ​ These accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses on transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.
The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial assets measured at fair value.
All amounts expressed in these accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the accompanying notes are expressed in United States dollars, except per share data and where otherwise indicated. References to “$” are to United States dollars and references to “C$” are to Canadian dollars. 13
Table of Contents Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, contingent assets and contingent liabilities as of the end of, or during, the reporting period. Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates. Significant areas requiring management to make estimates include the derivative liabilities, the valuation of equity instruments issued for services, income taxes and the product development and relocation grant. Further details of the nature of these assumptions and conditions may be found in the relevant notes to these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. The effect of a change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in comprehensive income in the period of the change, if the change affects that period only, or in the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed quarterly. ​ 3.     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are  not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 14
Table of Contents ​ 4.     SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ​ Short-term investments consist of guaranteed investment certificates (“GICs”) held at financial institutions purchased in accordance with the Company’s treasury policy. These GICs and term deposits bear interest at
1.58 %- 4.65 % per annum and have maturities of up to
12
months. ​ Short-term investments also consist of U.S. treasury securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper. The Company has classified these investments as available-for-sale, as the sale of such investments may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies, and therefore has classified all investment securities as current assets. Those investments with maturity dates of three months or less at the date of purchase are presented as cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheets. Short-term investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders’ equity (deficit) until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized or accreted to interest income as an adjustment to yield using the straight-line method over the life of the instrument. The Company records an allowance for credit losses when unrealized losses are due to credit-related factors. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method and recorded as interest income. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ As of December 31, 2022 ​ ​ ​ Amortized ​ Unrealized ​ ​ Accrued ​ ​ Estimated ​      ​ Cost      ​ Gains      ​ Losses      ​ Interest      ​ Fair Value ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ GICs and Term deposits ​ $

110,161,029 ​ As of December 31, 2022, short-term investments have an aggregate fair market value of
$ 111.9
million (September 30, 2022 –
$ 110.2
million) were in an aggregate gross unrealized loss position of
$ 29,239
(September 30, 2022 -
$ 58,666 ). The Company considers the decline in market value for the securities to be primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions. These particular investments have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any of its securities prior to maturity. Accordingly,
no
allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of December 31, 2022 and
no
realized gains or losses on sales of short-term investments have been recorded through December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, which represents the present value of the Company’s obligation to make payments over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using an incremental borrowing rate as the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate was
5.0 % and the remaining lease term for the South San Francisco office was
17 months
and Houston office was
7 months . Accretion expense of $ 2,350
(2021 - $ 3,884 ) has been recorded in “financing costs” in the condensed consolidated interim statements of operations and comprehensive loss. ​ ​ 8.     DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES In January 2016, the Company completed a private placement of
227,273
units of the Company at $ 66.00
per unit (“Unit”) for gross proceeds of $ 14,999,992 . Each Unit consisted of
one
common share of the Company,
one
7-year
cash and cashless exercise warrant (the “ 7-Year
Warrants”), and
one half
of one
2-year
cash exercise warrant (the “ 2-Year
Warrants”). The
7-Year
Warrants and
2-Year
Warrants have an exercise price of $ 66.00
per common share (collectively, the “2016 Warrants”). The holders of the
7-Year
Warrants may elect, in lieu of exercising the
7-Year
Warrants for cash, a cashless exercise option, in whole or in part, to receive common shares equal to the fair value of the
7-Year
Warrants based on the number of
7-Year
Warrants to be exercised multiplied by a ten-day weighted average market price less the exercise price with the difference divided by the weighted average market price. If a warrant holder exercises this option, there will be variability in the number of shares issued per
7-Year
Warrant. Additionally, the 2016 Warrants contain provisions which may require the Company to redeem the 2016 Warrants, at the option of the holder, in the event of a major transaction, such as a change of control or sale of the Company’s assets (“Major Transaction”). The redemption value would be subject to a Black-Scholes valuation at the time of exercise. In the event the consideration for a Major Transaction payable to the common shareholders is in cash, in whole or in part, the redemption of the 2016 Warrants would be made in cash pro-rata to the composition of the consideration. The potential for a cash settlement for the 2016 Warrants outside the control of the Company, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires the 2016 Warrants to be treated as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. The 2016 Warrants are not traded in an active market. All
227,273
warrants expired unexercised subsequent to December 31, 2022. Valuation The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value. The following weighted average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities on December 31, 2022 and 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31,  ​ ​ December 31,  ​ ​ ​ 2022      ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Risk-free interest rate

(the “ February 2021 Financing ”). The Company issued a total of
5,555,555
common shares of the Company at a public offering price of $ 27.00
per share, which includes the underwriters having exercised their
30-day
option to purchase an additional
724,637
common shares. In connection with the February 2021 Financing, the Company paid cash commissions of $ 8,999,999
and incurred other transaction costs of $ 229,451 . Nomination Rights In connection with a January 2016 private placement of
227,273
Units, a Unit consisting of
one
common share,
one
7-year
warrant and
one -half of one
2-year
warrant, of the Company, Clarus Lifesciences III, L.P. (“ Clarus ”) acquired
106,061
common shares. Clarus is entitled to nominate two directors to the board of directors of the Company, one of which must be an independent director and preapproved by the Company. These nomination rights will continue for so long as Clarus holds greater than or equal to
53,030
common shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Omnibus incentive plans The Company has adopted an omnibus incentive plan  (“Omnibus Plan”) consistent with the policies and rules of the Nasdaq.  Pursuant to the Omnibus Plan, the Company may issue stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units and other share-based awards. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not issued any instruments other than stock options under the Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2022, the Omnibus Plan has a maximum of
8,410,907
common shares which may be reserved for issuance. 18
Table of Contents Employee Share Purchase Plan The Company has adopted an Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) under which qualifying employees may be granted purchase rights (“Purchase Rights”) to the Company’s common shares at not less of
85 % of the market price at the lesser of the date the Purchase Right is granted or exercisable. The Company currently holds offerings consisting of
six month
periods commencing on January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year, with a single purchase date at the end of the purchase period on June 30 and December 31 of each calendar year. As of December 31, 2022, the ESPP has a maximum of
217,300
(2021 –
249,974 ) common shares reserved for issuance. Eligible employees are able to contribute up to
15 % of their gross base earnings for purchases under the ESPP through regular payroll deductions. Purchase of shares under the ESPP are limited for each employee at $ 25,000
worth of the Company’s common shares (determined using the lesser of (i) the market price of a common share on the first day of an applicable purchase period and (ii) the market price of a common share on the purchase date) for each calendar year in which a purchase right is outstanding. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued
19,298
shares (2021 –
2,444 ) upon the exercise of Purchase Rights. The Company recognizes compensation expense for purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the service period.

Table of Contents 10.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2022 is $ 90,956
(September 30, 2022 - $ 81,225 ) due to related parties with respect to key management personnel compensation and expense reimbursements. Amounts due to related parties are non-interest bearing, with no fixed terms of repayment. ​ ​ 11.    SEGMENTED INFORMATION The Company works in
one
industry being the development of small molecule drugs for prostate cancer. The Company’s right of use assets are located in the USA. ​ 12.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and derivative liabilities. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, GICs and term deposists included in short-term investments, receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying values due to their short term to maturity. The fair value of U.S. treasury securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper included in short-term investments  are measured using Level 2 inputs based on standard observable inputs, including reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and bids and/or offers (Note 4).The derivative liabilities are measured using Level 3 inputs (Note 8). Fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial instruments. As these estimates are subjective in nature, involving uncertainties and matters of judgement, they cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair values. Financial risk factors The Company’s risk exposures and the impact on the Company’s financial instruments are summarized below: Credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and receivables. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash with major financial institutions. The Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of up to twelve months when purchased to be short-term investments. Short-term investments includes investments that may have maturity dates exceeding one year at the date of purchase; however, the Company may liquidate investment positions prior to maturity to implement management strategies. The Company maintains an investment policy which requires certain minimum investment grades over its investment instruments. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash in Canada and the United States and term deposits in Canada and investments in certain instruments which have a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase. Balances in cash accounts exceed amounts insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation for up to C$ 100,000
and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for up to $ 250,000 . Amounts due from government agencies are considered to have minimal credit risk. Liquidity risk The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of $ 161,652,689 . The Company does not generate revenue and will be reliant on external financing to fund operations. Debt and equity financing are dependent on market conditions and may not be available on favorable terms. 22
Table of Contents Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, and foreign exchange rates. (a) Interest rate risk As of December 31, 2022, the Company has cash and cash equivalents balances and short-term investments which are interest bearing. Interest income is not central to the Company’s capital management strategy and not significant to the Company’s projected operational budget. Interest rate fluctuations are not significant to the Company’s risk assessment. (b) Foreign currency risk The Company’s foreign currency risk exposure relates to net monetary assets denominated in Canadian dollars and Euro.

Throughout this discussion, unless the context specifies or implies otherwise, the terms “ESSA,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to ESSA Pharma Inc. and its subsidiaries. Overview ESSA is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, focused on developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer with an initial focus on patients whose disease is progressing despite treatment with current standard of care therapies, including second-generation antiandrogen drugs such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide. The Company believes its latest series of investigational compounds, including its product candidate EPI-7386, have the potential to significantly expand the interval of time in which patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”) can benefit from anti-hormone-based therapies. Specifically, the compounds are designed to disrupt the androgen receptor (“AR”) signaling pathway, the primary pathway that drives prostate cancer growth and prevent AR activation through selective binding to the N-terminal domain (“NTD”) of the AR. In this respect, the Company’s compounds are designed to mechanistically differ from classical non-steroid antiandrogens. These antiandrogens interfere either with androgen synthesis (i.e., abiraterone), or with the binding of androgens to the ligand-binding domain (“LBD”), located at the opposite end of the receptor from the NTD (i.e., “lutamides”). A functional NTD is essential for the functionality of the AR; blocking the NTD inhibits AR-driven transcription and therefore androgen-driven biology. The Company believes that the transcription inhibition mechanism of its preclinical compounds is unique and has the potential advantage of bypassing several of the identified mechanisms of resistance to the antiandrogens currently used in the treatment of CRPC. The Company has been granted by the United States Adopted Names (“USAN”) Council a unique USAN stem “-Aniten” to recognize this new first-in-class mechanistic class. The Company refers to this series of proprietary investigational compounds as the “Aniten” series. In preclinical studies, blocking the NTD has demonstrated the capability to prevent AR-driven gene expression. A previously completed Phase 1 clinical trial of ESSA’s first-generation agent, ralaniten acetate (“EPI-506”) administered to patients with metastatic CRPC (“mCRPC”) refractory to current standard of care therapies demonstrated prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) declines, a sign of inhibition of AR-driven biology. This inhibition, however, was neither deep nor sustained enough to confer clinical benefit and the Company made the decision to develop a more potent next generation drug which would also have a longer half-life. The Company has done so and is now in clinical trial with this next generation Aniten, EPI-7386. 24
Table of Contents According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States, prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer among men, behind skin cancer. Approximately one-third of all prostate cancer patients who have been treated for local disease with curative intent will subsequently have rising serum levels of PSA, which is an indication of recurrent disease with or without development of distant metastasis. Patients with recurrent disease as indicated by rising PSA usually undergo initial androgen ablation therapy using analogues of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone or surgical castration; this approach is termed “androgen deprivation therapy” (“ADT”). Most of these patients initially respond to ADT; however, many experience a recurrence in tumor growth despite the reduction of testosterone to castrate levels, and at that point are considered to have CRPC. Following diagnosis of CRPC, patients have been generally treated with antiandrogens that block the binding of androgens (darolutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide or bicalutamide) to the AR, or inhibit synthesis of androgens (abiraterone). More recently, significant improvements in progression free survival and overall survival have been achieved by utilizing this latest generation of antiandrogens in combination with ADT earlier in the disease natural history (i.e., mHSPC and nmCRPC). Since the mid-20th century, it has been recognized that the growth of prostate tumors is in large part mediated by an activated AR. Generally, there are three means of activating the AR. First, androgens, such as dihydrotestosterone can activate AR by binding to its LBD. Second, CRPC can be driven by variants of AR that lack an LBD, are constitutively activated, and consequently do not require androgen for activation. A third mechanism, of less certain clinical significance, may involve certain signaling pathways that activate AR independent of androgen activity. Generally, current drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer are directed against the first mechanism by either (i) interfering with the production of androgen, or (ii) preventing androgen from binding to the LBD. Over time, these approaches eventually fail due to mechanisms of resistance which involve the LBD end of the receptor, whether at the DNA (AR amplification or LBD mutations) or RNA level (emergence of AR splice variants). With respect to the development of alternative pathway mechanisms of AR activation, tumors may also become insensitive to anti-androgen activity. Finally, in patients who have been treated for years with various antiandrogen therapies, genomic changes may lead to additional, non-AR-related oncogenic drivers, also insensitive to inhibition of AR biology. The Company believes that through their potential to block androgen-driven gene transcription by using a unique mechanism involving the NTD and thereby bypassing these known mechanisms of resistance to current antiandrogens, the Aniten series of compounds hold the potential to be effective in cases where LBD-based mechanisms of resistance to second generation antiandrogens in otherwise AR-driven disease are operating. The results from both extensive preclinical studies and the initial clinical experience support the Company’s belief. In preclinical studies, the Aniten series of compounds has been observed to shrink AR-dependent prostate cancer xenografts, including tumors both sensitive and resistant to the second-generation antiandrogens, such as enzalutamide. Plasma PSA level declines and increases in PSA doubling time as well as declines in circulating tumor DNA and decreases in radiographic tumor measurements were observed in a subset of patients enrolled in the Phase 1 study of EPI-7386 as described below. Importantly with respect to the potential clinical application of NTD inhibition during the natural history of the disease, recent studies by the Company and its collaborators have also suggested the potential advantage for combinations of the Company’s Aniten compounds with currently approved antiandrogens to inhibit AR-driven biology more completely than AR inhibition from either end of the receptor alone. This hypothesis is supported by the clinical trial results obtained in recent years of the superior overall survival obtained in the mHSPC setting by combining ADT and the latest generation anti-androgens earlier in the course of the disease versus the administration of these two therapies sequentially. 25
Table of Contents While the potential importance of the NTD as a drug target has been appreciated for more than two decades, for technical reasons this has been a difficult target for therapeutic agent development. The NTD of the AR is flexible with a high degree of intrinsic disorder making it difficult for use in classic crystal structure-based drug design. The Company is not currently aware of any clinical-stage NTD AR inhibitors that are in development by other drug development companies. The nature of the highly specific binding of the Aniten compounds to the NTD, and the biological consequences of that binding, have been defined in scientific studies. The selectivity of the binding, based on
in vivo
imaging as well as
in vitro
studies, has been consistent with the favorable toxicological results observed in preclinical studies of the first-generation EPI-506 and the subsequent safety results observed in the Phase 1 trial of EPI-506. Subsequent to this trial and following the decision to pursue EPI-7386 as the Company’s lead product candidate, the Company completed a series of biophysical and biological studies revealing the interaction and binding of EPI-7386 to the NTD of the AR and presented these findings at several medical conferences in 2021.  See “ Completed Phase 1 Clinical Study of EPI-506 ” and “ Next generation Aniten molecules ” below. The incidence of both metastatic and non-metastatic CRPC continues to rise, and using a dynamic progression model, Scher et al. 1
projected a 2020 incidence of 546,955 and prevalence of 3,072,480. The Company believes that the Aniten series of compounds could ultimately hold potential benefit for many of those patients. In its early clinical development, the Company focused on patients who have failed second-generation antiandrogen therapies (i.e., abiraterone and/or lutamides) for the following reasons: ● CRPC treatment remains a prostate cancer market segment with an apparent and significant unmet therapeutic need and is a potentially large market; ● the Company believes that the unique mechanism of action of its Aniten compounds is well suited to treat those patients who have failed AR LBD focused therapies and whose biological characterization reveals that their tumors are still largely driven by AR biology; and ● the Company expects that the relatively large number of patients with an apparent unmet therapeutic need in this area will facilitate timely enrollment in its clinical trials. Furthermore, the Company believes that the successful Phase 1 clinical trial facilitates the study of the combination of EPI-7386 with second-generation antiandrogens. The Company and its collaborators have developed preclinical
in vitro
and
in vivo
evidence supporting further evaluation of the combination of NTD inhibitors together with the LBD inhibiting antiandrogens. The Company believes that the application of two independent, complementary mechanisms of AR transcription inhibition may result in greater suppression of androgen activity and the delay or prevention of drug resistance. Recent progress in the clinical treatment of prostate cancer has resulted from the earlier utilization of antiandrogens in combination with classic ADT, consistent with the premise that more effective androgen suppression may yield clinical benefit. The Company believes that the introduction of NTD inhibitors such as EPI-7386 therefore has the potential to improve androgen suppression, delay the emergence of resistance, and result in improved clinical benefit.
Completed Phase 1 Clinical Study of EPI-506 The Company conducted an initial proof-of-concept Phase 1 clinical study utilizing the first-generation Aniten compound, EPI-506 from 2015 to 2017. The objective of the EPI-506 Phase 1 clinical trial was to explore the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of EPI-506, in addition to anti-tumor activity in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with mCRPC who were no longer responding to either abiraterone or enzalutamide treatments, or both. Efficacy endpoints, such as PSA reduction, and other disease progression criteria were evaluated. Details relating to the design of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of EPI-506 are available on the U.S. National Institutes of Health clinical trials website (see https://clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT02606123). 1

Table of Contents The Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA for EPI-506, to begin a Phase 1 clinical trial, was allowed in September 2015, with the first clinical patient enrolled in November 2015. The Company’s Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) submission to Health Canada was subsequently also cleared. Based on allometric scaling, an initial dose level of EPI-506 of 80 mg was determined. However, following the enrollment of the initial cohorts, it became apparent that EPI-506 exposure was much lower in humans than projected. EPI-506 dosing was escalated aggressively to allow patients in the clinical study greater exposure to the drug. The highest dose patients ultimately received was 3600 mg of EPI-506, administered in a single dose or split into two doses daily. The initial data from the Phase 1 clinical trial was presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting in September 2017. Conducted at five sites in the United States and Canada, the open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum-tolerated dose and anti-tumor activity of EPI-506 in men with end-stage mCRPC who had progressed after prior enzalutamide and/or abiraterone treatment and who may have received one prior line of chemotherapy. Twenty-eight patients were available for analysis, with each patient having received four or more prior therapies for prostate cancer at the time of study entry. Patients self-administered oral doses of EPI-506 ranging from 80 mg to 3600 mg, with a mean drug exposure of 85 days (range of eight to 535 days). Four patients underwent prolonged treatment (with a median of 318 days; and a range of 219 to 535 days at data cut-off), following intra-patient dose escalation. PSA declines, a measure of potential efficacy, ranging from 4% to 37% were observed in five patients, which occurred predominantly in the higher dose cohorts (≥1280 mg). EPI-506 was generally well-tolerated with favorable safety results observed across all doses up to 2400 mg. At a dose of 3600 mg, gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) were observed in two patients: one patient in the once-daily (“QD”) dosing cohort and one patient in the 1800 mg twice-daily dosing cohort, leading to study discontinuation and a dose-limiting toxicity (“DLT”) due to more than 25% of doses being missed in the 28-day safety reporting period. A separate patient in the 3600 mg QD cohort experienced a transient Grade 3 increase in liver enzymes (AST/ALT), which also constituted a DLT, and enrollment was consequently concluded in this cohort. Although the Company believes that the safety results and possible signs of anti-tumor activity observed at higher dose levels support the concept that inhibiting the AR-NTD may provide a clinical benefit to mCRPC patients, the pharmacokinetic and metabolic studies revealed the limitations of the first generation agent EPI-506. Through its discovery research the Company had concluded that it should be feasible to develop a next generation of NTD inhibitor which would demonstrate greater potency, reduced metabolism and other improved pharmaceutical properties. As a result, the Company announced on September 11, 2017 its decision to discontinue the further clinical development of EPI-506 and to implement a corporate restructuring plan to focus research and development resources on its next-generation Anitens targeting the AR-NTD. This next generation Aniten compound includes significantly more potent drugs designed to exhibit increased resistance to metabolism and therefore a longer predicted circulating half-life. The Company’s lead product candidate EPI-7386 has demonstrated these and other favorable characteristics in extensive preclinical characterization studies which the Company has presented in a series of poster presentations at scientific meetings. Next generation Aniten molecules The Company’s family of next-generation investigational Aniten compounds incorporate multiple chemical scaffold changes to the first-generation drugs which in preclinical studies retain NTD inhibition of the AR. In addition, they have shown improvement in a range of attributes when compared to the first-generation compound, EPI-506, in preclinical studies. In
in vitro
assays measuring inhibition of AR transcriptional activity, these product candidates demonstrated 20 times higher potency than EPI-506 or its active metabolite, EPI-002. In addition, the compounds have demonstrated increased metabolic stability in preclinical studies, suggesting the potential for longer half-lives in humans. Lastly, the compounds have demonstrated more favorable pharmaceutical properties relative to EPI-506. The Company believes that these product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may offer advancements in ease and cost of large-scale manufacture, drug product stability, and suitability for commercialization globally. Of these next-generation Anitens, EPI-7386 was selected for IND filing and a Phase 1 clinical trial.

Table of Contents Our Strategy In developing possible therapeutics that involve binding to the NTD, the Company’s strategic approach involves: ● pursuing the clinical development of EPI-7386 as a monotherapy treatment for patients with mCRPC resistant to the current standard of care, as a safe and effective therapy for those prostate cancer patients whose tumors have progressed on current antiandrogen therapy while remaining prevalently driven by the AR pathway; ● combining Aniten compounds with second-generation antiandrogens in earlier lines of therapy. The Company, with industry partners, has been conducting clinical trials of combinations of EPI-7386 and second-generation antiandrogens in patients with mCRPC in earlier lines of treatment; ● advancing the preclinical development of Aniten and Aniten-related compounds from the Company’s study of NTD degraders as a new approach to AR pathway inhibition. The Company's first generation of AR ANITen bAsed Chimera (“ANITAC”) demonstrates the feasibility of this new approach to AR pathway inhibition for patients with mCRPC; and ● continuing to further explore, preclinically, other potential applications for AR-NTD inhibitors. The identification and characteristics of EPI-7386 The purpose of the next-generation program has been to identify drug candidates with increased potency, reduced metabolic susceptibility and superior pharmaceutical properties compared to ESSA’s first-generation compounds. Structure-activity relation studies conducted on the chemical scaffold of ESSA’s first-generation compounds have resulted in the generation of a new series of compounds that have demonstrated higher potency and predicted longer half-lives. Multiple changes in the chemical scaffold have also been incorporated with the goal of improving ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and pharmaceutical properties of the chemical class. Several next-generation Aniten molecules met prespecified preclinical target product profile goals regarding potency, stability, selectivity and pharmaceutical properties. On March 26, 2019, the Company announced the nomination of EPI-7386 as its lead clinical candidate for the treatment of mCRPC through inhibition of the NTD of the androgen receptor. In preclinical studies, EPI-7386 has displayed activity
in vitro
in numerous AR-dependent prostate cancer models including models where second-generation antiandrogens are inactive. In addition, EPI-7386 is significantly more potent, metabolically stable and more effective in preclinical studies compared to ESSA’s first-generation compound, EPI-506. Lastly, EPI-7386 has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile in all animal studies of the compound conducted to date. From this series of next-generation compounds, EPI-7386 was selected as the lead candidate for clinical development in mCRPC. An IND was submitted to the FDA on March 30, 2020 and was allowed by the FDA on April 30, 2020. A CTA was filed with Health Canada in April 2020 and clearance was subsequently received. Clinical testing of EPI-7386 commenced in July 2020, allowing for accommodations to the planned timeline as a result of the impact of COVID-19 at clinical trial sites (see “ Risk Factors - Risks Relating to COVID-19 ” in our Annual report on Form 10-K). 28
Table of Contents Advancing EPI-7386 through clinical development
The Phase 1 clinical trial of EPI-7386 “Oral EPI-7386 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (EPI-7386)” is currently actively enrolling nmCRPC patients (“window of opportunity cohort”) and mCRPC patients who are refractory to standard of care treatments at clinical sites in the U.S. and Canada (www.clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT04421222). In September 2021, the Company amended the protocol to allow testing in the Phase 1a for a 800 mg/day and 1200 mg/day dosages, administered as either 400 mg or 600 mg dosed twice daily (“BID”), respectively. In addition, the protocol amendment focused further monotherapy development in less heavily pretreated patients with mCRPC, i.e., patients who have received a maximum of three prior approved systemic therapies for mCRPC, including at least one second-generation anti-androgen and excluded patients with visceral metastasis. The Company filed a further protocol amendment in July 2022 for Part 1b of the study. Specifically, the Part 1b study contains two components: Cohort A (dose expansion) which will further evaluate the safety and tolerability and anti-tumor activity of EPI-7386 in a patient population of chemo-naïve mCRPC patients whose diseases have progressed after two lines of treatment including at least one line of second-generation anti-androgens, and Cohort B “window of opportunity with clinical endpoints”, evaluating the anti-tumor activity of EPI-7386 for a limited window of time (up to 12 weeks prior to the start of standard of care therapy) in nmCRPC patients whose disease has been unperturbed by previous second-generation antiandrogen therapies or chemotherapy. ​ Part 1a – Safety and tolerability of EPI-7386 The open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1a clinical trial was designed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose and/or a recommended Phase 2 range of doses in line with the FDA’s Project
Optimus, and to access preliminary anti-tumor activity of the drug. The design of the Phase 1 clinical trial included the standard 3+3 design per dose cohort for the Part 1a dose escalation phase, with subjects receiving a daily oral dose of EPI-7386 once a day (QD) until there is objective evidence of clinical disease progression, and or occurrence of an unacceptable toxicity. The dose escalation Part 1a of the study has completed enrollment. Patients enrolled in the Part 1a of the study were selected clinically, on the basis of having progressive mCRPC as exemplified by rising PSA values and/or radiological disease progression despite latest generation antiandrogen treatment. However, all patients were also retrospectively biologically characterized for underlying tumor genomic characteristics, for evidence of AR pathway activation as well as non-AR oncogenic pathways and during the conduct of the trial, for dose-related biological, pharmacological and pharmacodynamic effects. Patients are currently being dosed at 1,000 mg QD and at 1,200 mg/day, administered as 600 mg dosed twice daily (BID), to enhance patient drug exposures, with each of these dose levels being cleared as safe and tolerable .The protocol amendments filed with the FDA in September 2021 and July 2022 allow for monotherapy development in less heavily pretreated patients (as described above) in whom the androgen receptor pathway is more likely to be the primary driver of tumor growth. The Company’s goal has been to establish, one or more doses/schedules to be tested in the expansion Phase 1b study in alignment with the FDA Project Optimus guidance, based on multiple inputs, including pharmacokinetic and biological observations, in addition to clinical experience. Two dose levels have been advanced to Phase 1b dose expansion testing: 600 mg QD and 600 mg BID. ​ The Part 1b component of the study, as described above, will have two cohorts enrolling in parallel: Part 1b Cohort A – Dose Expansion The primary objective of Cohort A is to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity (as measured by changes in tumor burden measured by imaging and changes in PSA levels over time) of EPI-7386 at 600 mg BID and 600 mg QD in a patient population enrolled under eligibility criteria similar to the one adopted for the Phase 1a with the exception of prior chemotherapy (not allowed for patients enrolled in this cohort). ​ 29
Table of Contents Part 1b Cohort B – Window of opportunity with clinical endpoints The primary objective of Cohort B is to assess the anti-tumor activity (as measured by changes of PSA over time) of EPI-7386 administered at 600 mg BID for a limited window of time (up to 12 weeks before patients start standard of care therapy) in nmCRPC patients whose disease is unperturbed by previous second-generation antiandrogen therapies or chemotherapy. Once the Phase 1 clinical trial is complete, the Company plans to review the totality of the data, including the safety, tolerability, evidence of efficacy and pharmacological and biomarker data. This overall experience will inform the final size, design, and timing of a Phase 2 clinical trial, and importantly, the clinical as well as biological characteristics of the patients with mCRPC considered most likely to benefit from this therapeutic approach despite the late stage of their disease. Subsequent Phase 2 and additional clinical trials, including trials of combination Aniten/lutamide therapy in earlier lines of treatment, should benefit from this initial clinical trial experience. ​ Combination studies – developing a new standard of care for the treatment of prostate cancer An activated AR is required for the growth and survival of most prostate cancer. Unlike current antiandrogen therapies which can only inhibit full-length AR, NTD inhibition of AR-directed biology occurs both in full length AR and splice variant ARs. Therefore, the Company believes that the AR-NTD is an ideal target for next-generation antiandrogen hormone therapy. If ESSA’s product candidate is successful in treating CRPC patients, it is reasonable to expect that such clinical candidate may be effective in treating earlier stage patients. Preclinical studies suggest particular value to the use of Anitens in combination with the currently widely used second-generation antiandrogens. The Company has announced a number of collaborative studies in line with this strategy. The first collaboration, with Janssen Research & Development, LLC (“Janssen”), to study in clinical trials the safety and potential benefit of combination of EPI-7386 with abiraterone acetate with prednisone as well as the combination of EPI-7386 with apalutamide in patients with mCRPC, was announced on January 13, 2021. Under the collaboration agreement with Janssen, Janssen would pay for and conduct a clinical trial with EPI-7386 and in separate cohorts each of their antiandrogens, apalutamide and abiraterone acetate. This combination trial was initiated in March 2022. Enrollment was suspended by Janssen in October 2022 due to operational recruitment challenges. ESSA has announced its intention to revise the collaboration, with ESSA conducting a study of the combinations, potentially in an earlier patient population, and Janssen supplying apalutamide and abiraterone acetate. A second collaboration and supply agreement with Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”) to evaluate EPI-7386 in combination with Astellas and Pfizer Inc.’s androgen receptor inhibitor, enzalutamide, in patients with mCRPC was announced on February 24, 2021. ESSA is paying for and is operationally conducting this trial, with an initial Phase 1 dose equilibration followed by a randomized Phase 2 trial involving a planned 120 patients. The enzalutamide for this trial is supplied by Astellas. The first patient in this Phase 1/2 study was dosed in January 2022 and the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and initial PSA responses were originally reported in the June 2022 clinical update and more recently in a poster presentation at the Prostate Cancer Foundation Retreat 2022. A third collaboration and supply agreement with Bayer Consumer Care AG (“Bayer”) to evaluate EPI-7386 in combination with Bayer’s androgen receptor inhibitor, darolutamide, in patients with mCRPC was announced on April 28, 2021. Under the collaboration with Bayer, Bayer will pay for and conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial with EPI-7386 to evaluate EPI-7386 in combination with darolutamide in earlier line mCRPC patients and ESSA will provide EPI-7386 for the combination trial being conducted by Bayer. This clinical trial has not yet been initiated. The Company continues to evaluate potential collaborations that could enhance the value of its prostate cancer program and allow it to leverage the expertise of such strategic collaborators such as those with Janssen,Astellas, and Bayer. Preclinical Development of Anitens, Degraders, and other indications 30
Table of Contents As part of the continued preclinical work on Aniten compounds, the Company has studied NTD degraders and presented data for its first generation of AR ANITAC NTD degraders at the AACR annual meeting on April 10, 2022 in a poster titled “Androgen receptor (AR) N-Terminal Domain degraders can degrade AR full length and AR splice variants in CRPC preclinical models”.   The preclinical data demonstrate the potential of ESSA’s ANITAC degraders as a new approach to AR pathway inhibition. The intrinsically disordered nature of the NTD region of the AR has meant it has generally been considered undruggable.  The preclinical studies have shown that through their unique ability to bind to the NTD of AR, ANITACs have the ability to inhibit NTD-mediated AR transcription while also degrading AR protein including resistant forms of AR which are commonly associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer. The Company continues to design and test ANITAC degraders with a focus on improving selectivity. The preclinical results demonstrate that ANITAC degraders utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system and can degrade many forms of AR including full length, mutant, and splice variants which are often expressed in CRPC patients. Specifically, the ANITAC degraders show robust potency in inhibiting AR transcriptional activity driven by AR-FL, AR-V7, or AR-V567es.  In addition, the orally-bioavailable ANITAC degraders exhibit high potency in inhibiting AR-dependent transcription and reducing viability of AR-dependent prostate cancer cells. The Company continues preclinical work on other emerging potential clinical applications for NTD inhibitors. Recent
Developments The Company has presented preclinical and clinical scientific data relative to EPI-7386 in a number of presentations at scientific meetings and other forums.
2022 On October 31, 2022, the Company announced that Janssen Research and Development is suspending enrollment into the Phase 1 clinical study of EPI-7386 with apalutamide and EPI-7386 with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in mCRPC patients as a result of operational recruitment challenges. Initial clinical activity was observed in some patients, with two of the three patients achieving a PSA reduction of 90% (“PSA90”) within 12 weeks. The Company is in discussions with Janssen to supply abiraterone acetate and apalutamide for an ESSA-sponsored combination study. On October 26, 2022, the Company announced the presentation of preclinical data for its lead first generation AR ANITen bAsed Chimera (“ANITAC”™) NTD degrader in a poster session at the 34th EORTC-NCI-AACR Annual Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. On October 26, 2022, the Company announced the presentation of updated clinical data from the first two cohorts of the Phase 1/2 study of ESSA's lead candidate EPI-7386 in combination with enzalutamide at the 2022 Prostate Cancer Foundation Scientific Retreat. In the multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 dose escalation study, seven mCRPC patients naïve to second generation antiandrogens were enrolled in the first two cohorts, with escalating doses of EPI-7386 and a fixed 120 mg once a day (QD) dose of enzalutamide. The study permitted one prior line of chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic results from these first two cohorts demonstrated that enzalutamide exposure was minimally impacted by EPI-7386 while exposures of EPI-7386 were reduced by coadministration with enzalutamide, but remained in the clinically relevant range as suggested by preclinical xenograft studies. The safety of the combination was favorable with a safety profile consistent with second-generation antiandrogens and no dose limiting toxicities were observed. One of the patients in the first cohort discontinued after one cycle of dosing due to a strong CYP3A inducer concomitant medication which lowered exposures to both EPI-7386 and enzalutamide and was therefore not evaluable for efficacy. Anti-tumor activity in the remaining six patients enrolled demonstrated that four of six of these patients achieved a PSA90 by 12 weeks of dosing and five of six patients to date have achieved a PSA90. On September 13, 2022, the Company appointed Philip Kantoff to its Board of Directors (the “Board”). On June 30, 2022, the Company announced the establishment of Automatic Securities Disposition Plans for its President and Chief Executive Officer, David R. Parkinson and its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Peter Virsik. 31
Table of Contents On June 27, 2022, the Company presented, by conference call and webcast, a clinical update on EPI-7386 monotherapy and combination therapy clinical development. The update on the Phase 1a dose escalation study showed initial data from 36 patients that demonstrated that EPI-7386 was well-tolerated, exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and demonstrated initial anti-tumor activity in a heavily pretreated group of patients. The Company believes the favorable safety and tolerability profile, good pharmaceutical characteristics together with both antiandrogen biological and anti-tumor activity support the Company’s decision to move into earlier lines of therapy and study EPI-7386 in combination with second-generation antiandrogens. The update also noted that ctDNA molecular analysis in the heavily pretreated population has provided a detailed profile of genetic alterations, which reveals the biological complexity of late-stage mCRPC patients and also allows for the continued refinement of the population of prostate cancer patients whose tumors are still primarily driven by the androgen receptor, and therefore most likely to respond to an androgen receptor inhibitor. The update detailed that in the multi-center, open-label Phase 1a dose escalation study, 31 patients received EPI-7386 as oral tablets once a day (QD) in cohorts with 200 milligram increments from 200 milligrams up to 1000 milligrams. Patients in this QD group were heavily pretreated, with a median of seven lines of prior therapy for prostate cancer and four lines of therapy for mCRPC. Almost 60% of patients had been treated with prior chemotherapy. Patients entered the trial with rapidly progressive disease, as evidenced by a median PSA doubling time of only 2.1 months and a median ctDNA percent of 29%. Almost a third of the patients had lung, liver, or brain metastases, and an overlapping third of patients had overt neuroendocrine differentiation. The ctDNA analysis revealed that tumors in these patients had extensive non-AR associated genomic changes denoting the presence of multiple non-AR oncogenic drivers associated with late-stage prostate cancer. Subsequent to a protocol amendment, the experience was also presented for the five initial patients enrolled in a twice daily dose regimen in 400 mg and 600 mg BID cohorts. The amendment excluded patients who had been treated with more than three prior lines of therapy, excluded patients with visceral metastases, and permitted only one prior line of chemotherapy. The key safety results from both QD and BID patients, as of June 1, 2022, showed that EPI-7386 was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels and schedules tested, with no dose-limiting toxicities, treatment related adverse events were limited to Grade 1 or Grade 2, with one Grade 3 occurrence of anemia ultimately deemed unlikely to be treatment related, and that there was no apparent dose dependency in any of the side effects. Antiandrogen response was assessed by changes in circulating PSA levels, changes in ctDNA levels, and radiographic changes in disease burden measured by both traditional RECIST criteria as well as by total lesion volumetric quantification using the AIQ Solutions platform.
​ The key response findings in both QD and BID patients, as of June 1, 2022, demonstrated that tumor volume decreased in five patients out of 10 patients who had measurable disease and were on therapy for more than 12 weeks. PSA decrease or  PSA stabilization was observed in a clinical subset of patients with no visceral disease, fewer DNA genomic aberrations in non-AR oncogenic pathways, and fewer than 3 lines of therapy. This provides further information to support refining the monotherapy development program patient population. In 17 patients with measurable ctDNA levels at baseline, ctDNA declines were observed in patients harboring AR point mutations, AR gain/amplification and AR truncations, suggesting EPI-7386’s potential activity against these tumors. The Company update also described the planned Phase 1b study, the planned window of opportunity cohort and the status of the combination study of EPI-7386 with enzalutamide. The Phase 1b study will evaluate a patient population of mCRPC similar to the one treated under the Phase 1a BID cohort but with the additional exclusion of prior chemotherapy. Up to 12 patients per each dose/schedule (600 mg QD and either 400mg or 600 mg BID) will be evaluated to gain additional information about safety, tolerability, exposure and anti-tumor activity of EPI-7386 in a less heavily pretreated patient population. The update also described the planned window of opportunity cohort as part of the Phase 1b expansion in which a separate group of non-metastatic CRPC will be enrolled into a 12-week study with a clinical endpoint (i.e. PSA changes) to assess the anti-tumor activity of EPI-7386 in a patient population in which the disease is mainly AR-driven and the tumor biology has not been affected by second-generation antiandrogen therapy. 32
Table of Contents The clinical update also provided the status of the combination studies evaluating EPI-7386 in earlier lines of therapy in Phase 1/2 trials which combine EPI-7386 with approved second-generation antiandrogens. In the Phase 1/2 study being conducted by the Company of EPI-7386 in combination with Astellas Pharma Inc.'s and Pfizer Inc.'s AR inhibitor, enzalutamide, in patients with mCRPC who have not been treated with second-generation antiandrogens, the first cohort had cleared the 28 day DLT period with no safety issues and when reported the trial was currently enrolling the second cohort of patients. The preliminary data from the first cohort in the Phase 1/2 combination trial with enzalutamide suggests that the drugs can be combined safely and based upon clinical and preclinical data predicted to be active. The early data, in addition to preclinical studies, support EPI-7386’s potential in combination with second-generation antiandrogens to suppress androgen receptor biology and induce a potent anti-tumor response. The Company also described the anticipated initiation later in 2022 of a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored neoadjuvant study which will evaluate darolutamide compared to EPI-7386 + darolutamide in patients undergoing prostatectomy for high-risk localized prostate cancer. At the AACR annual meeting on April 10, 2022, in a poster titled “Androgen receptor (AR) N-Terminal Domain degraders can degrade AR full length and AR splice variants in CRPC preclinical models”, the Company presented preclinical data for its first generation of androgen receptor (AR) ANITen bAsed Chimera (ANITAC™) N-terminal domain (NTD) degraders. The preclinical data demonstrated the potential of ESSA’s ANITAC degraders as a new approach to AR pathway inhibition. The intrinsically disordered nature of the NTD region of the AR has meant it has generally been considered undruggable. The preclinical studies have shown that through their unique ability to bind to the NTD of AR, ANITACs have the ability to inhibit NTD-mediated AR transcription while also degrading AR protein including resistant forms of AR which are commonly associated with CRPC. The preclinical results demonstrate that ANITAC degraders utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system and can degrade many forms of AR including full length, mutant and splice variants which are often expressed in CRPC patients. Specifically, the ANITAC degraders show robust potency in inhibiting AR transcriptional activity driven by AR-FL, AR-V7, or AR-V567es. In addition, the orally-bioavailable ANITAC degraders exhibit high potency in inhibiting AR-dependent transcription and reducing viability of AR-dependent prostate cancer cells. The Company continues to design and test ANITAC degraders with a focus on improving selectivity. On January 19, 2022, the Company announced the first patient dosed in the Company-sponsored Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ESSA’s lead product candidate, EPI-7386, a first-in-class N-terminal domain androgen receptor inhibitor, in combination with Astellas and Pfizer Inc.’s ligand-binding domain androgen receptor inhibitor, enzalutamide, in patients with mCRPC. This combination trial investigates the potential clinical benefit of inhibiting the androgen receptor through two independent pathways in the treatment of patients with mCRPC who have not yet received treatment with a second-generation antiandrogen drug. In preclinical models, the combination of EPI-7386 with lutamides by simultaneously targeting both ends of the AR resulted in deeper and broader inhibition of androgen biology. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT05075577) is a two part study. Phase 1 evaluates the safety and tolerability of the drug combination to establish the recommended Phase 2 range of doses for EPI-7386 and enzalutamide when dosed in combination. This Phase of the study is expected to enroll up to 30 mCRPC patients who have not yet been treated with second-generation antiandrogen therapies. As described below on June 27, 2022 the results of the initial experience with the first cohort were presented, demonstrating the safety and tolerability of the combination in this first cohort, along with the accompanying pharmacokinetic and PSA reduction information. In Phase 2, single agent enzalutamide is compared to the combination of enzalutamide and EPI-7386 in the same patient population. The goal of Phase 2 is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of EPI-7386 in combination with a fixed dose of enzalutamide compared with enzalutamide as a single agent. This part of the study is expected to enroll 120 mCRPC patients who have not yet been treated with second-generation antiandrogen therapies. 2021 In October 2021 the company disclosed the development of a collaboration with Caris Life Sciences, involving the incorporation of Caris’ newly developed cNAS (“circulating nucleic acid sequencing”) assay in the characterization of patients receiving EPI-7386. The Company believes that the characterization of real time individual patient biology will
33
Table of Contents contribute significantly to understanding the extent to which individual patient’s tumors are still AR driven and what mechanisms of resistance exist. At the October AACR, National Cancer Institute, and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Virtual International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, the Company presented preclinical data characterizing the mechanism of action of EPI-7386, including the results of NMR studies which confirm the binding of the compound to the NTD of the AR, a region not currently targeted by other antiandrogen therapies. The data also demonstrated that the combination of EPI-7386 with enzalutamide results in complete inhibition of genome-wide androgen-induced AR binding, supporting the rationale for Phase 1 / 2 combination trials of EPI-7386 with approved antiandrogens in patients with mCRPC. On February 11, 2021, the Company presented preclinical and clinical pharmacology data from ESSA’s Phase 1 clinical trial of EPI-7386 for the treatment of patients with mCRPC at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in an oral poster presentation titled, “Preclinical and clinical pharmacology of EPI-7386, an androgen receptor N-terminal domain inhibitor for castration-resistant prostate cancer.” The poster is available on the Company website.
Data on the poster included a comparison of preclinical projections of EPI-7386 clinical pharmacokinetic parameters to the pharmacokinetic, safety and preliminary clinical data from the initial 200 mg cohort of patients enrolled in ESSA’s multi-center, open-label, ascending multiple-dose Phase 1 study of EPI-7386 to treat patients with mCRPC who have become resistant to standard of care treatments. Patients participating in this trial have progressed on two or more approved systemic therapies for mCRPC, including at least one second-generation antiandrogen therapy not necessarily in the metastatic disease setting. In this initial cohort of patients receiving the 200 mg once-daily dose, EPI-7386 was well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects observed. The results from this cohort support ESSA’s preclinical projections regarding the pharmacologic properties of EPI-7386 in humans. EPI-7386 was well-absorbed, demonstrated high exposure levels and was confirmed to have a long half-life of at least 24 hours. The predicted exposures of EPI-7386 in patients at that 200 mg dose level were similar to the Company’s modeled projections and were still below optimal target exposures of EPI-7386 associated with anti-tumor activity in animal models. Although the 200 mg dose exposure was suboptimal, one out of three patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy experienced a PSA decline of more than 50 percent after three cycles of EPI-7386 therapy (12 weeks) with ongoing continued PSA declines continuing through seventeen cycles of therapy, despite previously having failed enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate. At the 2021 American Association of Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting, which took place virtually April 10-15, 2021, ESSA presented an e-poster presentation titled, “Comprehensive in vitro characterization of the mechanism of action of EPI-7386, an androgen receptor N-terminal inhibitor.” The content of this poster added to previously presented data that EPI-7386 binds to the full-length androgen receptor, inhibits the transcription of AR-regulated genes, and physically interacts with the splice variant form AR-V7, by demonstrating that EPI-7386 can prevent the androgen receptor from binding to genomic DNA and is active against additional androgen receptor splice variants, including AR-v567es. These preclinical data suggest EPI-7386 can potentially inhibit AR related transcription, a key driver of prostate cancer, and further supports the ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation study. The data also showed that EPI-7386, in combination with enzalutamide, may result in broader and deeper inhibition of the AR pathway, underscoring the potential clinical benefit of combining EPI-7386 with current standard-of-care antiandrogen therapies for prostate cancer patients at earlier stages of the disease. 2020 At the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR Annual Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (“ENA”) on October 24, 2020, an oral poster presentation titled, “The preclinical characterization of the N-terminal domain androgen receptor inhibitor, EPI-7386, for the treatment of prostate cancer,” presented new information about EPI-7386 including: (i) in an
in vitro
cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), EPI-7386 was shown to physically interact with the both the full-length and the splice variant (AR-V7) form of the AR (ii) in an
in vitro
full-length AR-driven cellular model (LNCaP), RNAseq data was analyzed by pathway enrichment analysis. EPI-7386 demonstrates largely similar modulation of AR-regulated genes compared to enzalutamide, but with additional unique elements; and (iii) EPI-7386 exhibits superior activity to
34
Table of Contents enzalutamide in the AR-V7-driven cellular models LNCaP95 and 22Rv1 by modulating AR-driven gene expression with or without the addition of an external androgen. Previously,
in vitro
data had been presented demonstrating that EPI-7386 binds to the full-length AR and can inhibit the transcription of AR-regulated genes. The new data demonstrates that EPI-7386 can also physically interact with the splice variant form of the androgen receptor, AR-V7, and inhibit its activity. The importance of this interaction with AR-V7 is seen through the superior transcriptional inhibition of AR-regulated genes by EPI-7386 compared to enzalutamide in the AR-V7-driven cell models LNCaP95 and 22Rv1. Together, these data provide insights into mechanistic aspects related to the binding and utility of EPI-7386 against AR-V7 splice-variant driven prostate cancer models. The data supports the Company’s rationale for studying EPI-7386 in men with prostate cancer resistant to current antiandrogens. Future Clinical Development Program Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial Design for treating CRPC patients Depending on the results of the Phase 1 study, a Phase 2 single arm clinical trial evaluating the activity of EPI-7386 single agent in a larger group of biologically-characterized mCRPC patients might be conducted. Considerations related to the decision to conduct such a trial relate to the company’s ability to identify those patients who, having progressed on one or another late generation anti-androgen, have tumors which are still predominantly AR-driven. Our experience during the conduct of the Phase 1 dose escalation trial has revealed that many such patients will have tumors driven predominantly by other oncogenic drivers. Those patients whose tumors remain predominantly AR-driven are the population most likely to benefit clinically from Aniten therapy, and the size of this population will weigh in the decision as to whether or not to pursue a single agent registration strategy. In order to ultimately obtain full single agent regulatory approval, the Company expects that at least one Phase 3 clinical trial will be required, most likely in patients similar to the population of mCRPC patients who will have been enrolled in the planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial. However, the results of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial may also suggest modification of the initial patient population based on anti-tumor response and biomarker assessment. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, the key end-point is expected to be progression-free survival or overall survival relative to patients receiving the standard of care. It is expected that such a Phase 3 clinical trial would be conducted at numerous sites around the world. ​ Competition The competition in the prostate cancer market is very high, many of the companies against which we compete or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Several pharmaceutical therapies already have approved and many new molecules are being tested for their effect in this patient population. In addition, generic forms of Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) and reformulations of abiraterone acetate are now approved and commercially available in the U.S. 35

Since Anitens have been shown to directly bind to AR-NTD and prevent AR-mediated transcription, they have the potential to bypass the AR-dependent resistance pathways (discussed above) that may develop as a result of treatment with current hormone-related therapies that target the AR LBD. If successful, ESSA believes this could represent a significant step forward in the treatment of prostate cancer. To ESSA’s knowledge, no other antagonist to the AR-NTD is currently undergoing clinical trials for prostate cancer or any other indication. Other approaches to interfering with AR signaling include potentially complementary strategies to degrade the AR such as that being pursued by Arvinas, Inc. 36
Table of Contents Patents and Proprietary Rights License Agreement with UBC and the BCCA ESSA has in-licensed intellectual property embodied in issued patents, pending patents applications and know-how relating to compounds that modulate AR activity. ESSA refers to these intellectual property rights as the “Licensed IP”. The Company is party to a license agreement with the British Columbia Cancer Agency and the University of British Columbia dated December 22, 2010, as amended on February 10, 2011, May 27, 2014, and May 25, 2021 (the “License Agreement”), which provides the Company with exclusive world-wide rights to develop and commercialize products based on the Licensed IP.
ESSA paid a minimum annual royalty of C$85,000 in 2017, 2018, and 2019 and must continue to pay a minimum of C$85,000 for each year thereafter. For a First Compound entering clinical development, an additional C$50,000 and C$900,000 must be paid upon enrollment of a patient in a Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trial, respectively. The Licensors may terminate the License Agreement upon ESSA’s insolvency, or the License Agreement may be terminated by either party for certain material breaches by the other party. ESSA has already spent more than C$5,000,000 in connection with the commercialization of products relating directly to the Licensed IP, as required under the License Agreement. ESSA is required to allocate reasonable time to the development and commercialization of the Licensed IP and to use reasonable efforts to promote, market and sell products covered by the Licensed IP. The terms of the License Agreement required ESSA to issue to the Licensors, 1,000,034 pre-Consolidation Common Shares, in lieu of payment of an initial license fee. If ESSA develops products covered by the Licensed IP in the future, it will be required to pay certain development and regulatory milestone payments up to an aggregate of C$2.4 million for the first drug product developed under the license and up to an aggregate of C$510,000 for each subsequent product. ESSA must also pay the Licensors low single-digit royalties based on aggregate worldwide net sales of products covered by the Licensed IP and a percentage of sublicensing revenue in the low teens. The License Agreement will expire on the later of 20 years after the date of the License Agreement or the expiry of the last issued patent included in the Licensed IP. ESSA’s Intellectual Property Strategy The Company currently retains all commercial rights for its Aniten series drug portfolio and believes it has developed a strong and defensive intellectual property position for the Aniten structural classes. ESSA has licensed certain patent rights, with respect to some of its compounds that modulate AR activity, from the Licensors. ESSA has the right to acquire ownership of the licensed patents and patent applications upon specified payment to the Licensors, and providing that payments required under the License Agreement continue to be made. As of November 2022, ESSA owns rights to 62 issued patents, including 17 issued U.S. patents, that are in force and cover multiple EPI- and Aniten structural classes of compounds with different structural motifs/analogues. As of November 2022, 6 of these issued patents cover the EPI-7386 compound and are expected to provide protection until the expiration dates, ranging from 2036 to 2042. Patent applications are also pending in the United States and in contracting states to the Patent Cooperation Treaty for the Aniten next-generation NTD inhibitors, with expected expiration dates between 2036-2042. Both ESSA and the broader pharmaceutical industry attach significant importance to patents for the protection of new technologies, products and processes. Accordingly, ESSA’s success depends, in part, on its ability to obtain patents or rights thereto, to protect commercial secrets and carry on activities without infringing the rights of third parties. See “ Risk Factors ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Where appropriate, and consistent with management’s objectives, ESSA will continue to seek patents in relation to components or concepts of its technology that it perceives to be important. 37
Table of Contents Regulatory Environment The production and manufacture of ESSA’s product candidate and potential future product candidates and its R&D activities are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy, quality and ethics by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, drugs and biological products are subject to regulation by the FDA. In Canada, these activities are regulated by the Food and Drugs Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, which are enforced by the TPD. Drug approval laws require registration of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of product candidates, government review and approval of experimental results prior to giving approval to sell drug products. Regulators also require that rigorous and specific standards such as cGMP, good laboratory practices (“GLP”) and current good clinical practices (“GCP”) are followed in the manufacture, testing and clinical development respectively of any drug product. See “ Risk Factors ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the corresponding compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. Drug Products Development Process An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: ● completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical laboratory tests, and preclinical animal trials in compliance with applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies, including GLPs; ● submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; ● approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; ● performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as GCP regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its intended use; ● preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); ● review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; ● satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; ● payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and ● compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) and post-approval studies required by the FDA. Preclinical Studies Preclinical studies are conducted
in vitro
and in animals to evaluate pharmacokinetics, metabolism and possible toxic effects to provide evidence of the safety of the product candidate prior to its administration to humans in clinical studies and throughout development. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part
38
Table of Contents of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. Initiation of Human Testing Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. In Canada, this application is called a CTA. An IND/CTA application must be filed and accepted by the FDA or TPD, as applicable, before human clinical trials may begin. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Two key factors influencing the rate of progression of clinical trials are the rate at which patients can be enrolled to participate in the research program and whether effective treatments are currently available for the disease that the drug is intended to treat. Patient enrollment is largely dependent upon the incidence and severity of the disease, the treatments available and the potential side effects of the drug to be tested and any restrictions for enrollment that may be imposed by regulatory agencies. Phase 1 Clinical Trials Phase 1 clinical trials for cancer therapeutics are typically conducted on a small number of patients to evaluate safety, dose limiting toxicities, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and to determine the dose for Phase 2 clinical trials in humans. Phase 2 Clinical Trials Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve a larger patient population than Phase 1 clinical trials and are conducted to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of a product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Phase 3 Clinical Trials Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve testing an experimental drug on a much larger population of patients suffering from the targeted condition or disease – in ESSA’s case, CRPC. These studies involve testing the experimental drug in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed test sites (multi-center trials) to establish clinical safety and effectiveness. These trials also generate information from which the overall risk-benefit relationship relating to the drug can be determined. 39
Table of Contents In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. New Drug Application Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, or the TPD as part of a New Drug Submission (“NDS”), requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. The NDS or NDA is then reviewed by the applicable regulatory body for approval to market the drug. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within nine months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,500,000 and the manufacturer or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to significant annual program and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. 40
Table of Contents On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or nine months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Post-Approval Requirements Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, significant changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: ● restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; ● fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; ● refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; ● product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or ● injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 41
Table of Contents The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Orphan Designation and Exclusivity ESSA may, in the future, seek orphan drug designation for its product candidates. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 42

206,202,601 ​ ESSA has never been profitable and has incurred net losses since inception. ESSA’s comprehensive losses were $6,712,455 and $9,097,919 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 respectively. ESSA expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and it expects these losses to increase as it continues the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, its product candidate. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, ESSA is unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, it will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. ​ 43
Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 There was no revenue in any of the periods ended as reported.

R&D expense in the three month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 reflects the ongoing clinical trial of EPI-7386 which commenced in July 2020. The share-based payments expense of $791,192 (2021 - $1,259,351), which is a non-cash expense, relates to the value assigned to stock options and employee share purchase rights granted to key management and consultants of the Company. The expense is recognized in relation to the grant and vesting of these equity instruments, net of expiries and forfeitures, and allocated to research and development, general and administration and financing expenditures relative to the activity of the underlying optionee. Clinical costs of $1,379,393 (2021 - $859,646) were generated in relation to expenditures associated with the Company’s clinical research organizations conducting the Phase 1 clinical trial of EPI-7386. Preclinical and data analysis costs of $1,492,268 (2021 – $1,774,205) were generated in relation to expenditures for pharmacokinetic data analysis on data from the clinical trial related to the Phase 1 study and work on preclinical pipeline and Anitac compounds.   Manufacturing costs of $843,151 (2021 - $1,028,035) includes amount for cGMP manufacturing of EPI 7386 drug supply to support the ongoing clinical trial as well as costs incurred in formulation and chemistry work around the Company’s pharmaceutical characteristics of EPI-7386. ​ Consulting costs were $89,573 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 (2021 - $142,596) relating to contract project management services. ​ 44
Table of Contents Legal patents and license fees for the period totaled $105,061 (2021 - $306,640). The Company has adopted a tiered patent strategy to protect its intellectual property as the pharmaceutical industry places significant importance on patents for the protection of new technologies, products and processes. The costs reflect that ongoing investment and the timing of associated maintenance costs. The Company anticipates that there will be continued investment into patent applications. ​ General and Administration Expenditures General and administrative expenses include the following major expenses by nature: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has working capital of $161,652,689 (September 30, 2022 - $166,748,942). Operational activities during the three months ended December 31, 2022 were financed mainly by proceeds from the financings completed in July 2020 and February 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company had available cash reserves and short-term investments of $163,071,497 (September 30, 2022 - $167,237,504) to settle current liabilities of $2,935,144 (September 30, 2022 - $2,310,399). At December 31, 2022, the Company believed that it had sufficient capital to satisfy its obligations as they became due and execute its planned expenditures for more than twelve months. ​ 45
Table of Contents ESSA’s future cash requirements may vary materially from those now expected due to a number of factors, including the costs associated with future preclinical work and to take advantage of strategic opportunities, such as partnering collaborations or mergers and acquisitions activities. In the future, it may be necessary to raise additional funds. These funds may come from sources such as entering into strategic collaboration arrangements, the issuance of shares from treasury, or alternative sources of financing. However, there can be no assurance that ESSA will successfully raise funds to continue its operational activities. See “ Risk Factors ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company makes estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The effect of a change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in comprehensive income in the period of the change, if the change affects that period only, or in the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.
The critical accounting policies are those polices that require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated interim financial statements. A summary of the critical accounting policies is presented in Note 3 of the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the SEC and with the securities commissions in Alberta and Ontario on December 13, 2022. Trend Information ESSA is a clinical development stage company and does not currently generate revenue. The Company is focused on the development of small molecule drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. The Company has acquired a license to certain Licensed IP. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, no products are in commercial production or use. The Company’s financial success will be dependent upon its ability to continue development of its compounds through preclinical and clinical stages to commercialization. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement ESSA has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Table of Contents Item 3.     Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10Q, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Any such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on our evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurances. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the internal control – integrated framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO framework) to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ 47
