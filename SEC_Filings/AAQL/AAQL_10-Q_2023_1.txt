NOTE
ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements
regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations,
are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and
trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business
operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not
possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which
any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements
we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking
statements.
We
undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required
by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Achison,” “company,” “we,” “us,”
and “our” in this document refer to Achison Inc, a New York corporation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
In
the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. However, the results of operations included
in such financial statements may not necessary be indicative of annual results.
The
Company uses the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on June 28, 2022
(“2021 Form 10-K.”)
9
Use
of Estimates
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The
preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those
estimates and assumptions.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents include cash in banks, bank deposits, and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the
date of origination.
Intangible
assets, net
The
Company’s intangible asset with definite useful lives consists of a website. The Company typically amortizes its intangible asset
with definite useful lives on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the contractual terms or the estimated useful lives. The Company
estimate the useful lives of the website is
10
years.
The
website -
www.Dazhong368.com
(the “Website”) was acquired from entities under common control by issuing
10
million
shares of Class A common stock in September 2019, and the
zero
carry value of the website at the related party’s book was transferred
for the assets purchase. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had
nil
intangible assets.
Impairment
of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
Management
reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets with finite lives for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization
are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other,” or more often
if there are indications of possible impairment.
The
analysis to determine whether or not an asset is impaired requires significant judgment that is dependent on internal forecasts, including
estimated future cash flows, estimates of long-term growth rates for our business, the expected life over which cash flows will be realized
and assumed royalty and discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair
value and any impairment charge. While the fair value of these assets exceeds their carrying value based on management’s current
estimates and assumptions, materially different estimates and assumptions in the future in response to changing economic conditions,
changes in the business, increased competition or loss of market share, product innovation or obsolescence, product claims that result
in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life or for other reasons could result in the recognition of impairment
losses.
Revenue
Recognition
Revenue
is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration
we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company determines revenue recognition by applying the following
steps: 1) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Advertising
revenue is generated by displaying advertising products on the Website. The Company recognizes revenue from the display of impression-based
advertisements in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an advertisement
is displayed to users. In general, the Company presents advertising revenue on a gross basis, since the Company controls the advertising
inventory before it is transferred to its customers. Control of advertisement inventory is evidenced by the Company’s sole ability
to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Pricing for our services is generally a fixed amount
and is typically due within 30 days upon signing the contract with customers. Unsatisfied performance obligations under advertising contracts
are recorded as contract liabilities.
10
Income
Taxes
The
Company records income tax expense using the asset-and-liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred
taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence,
it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
When
tax returns are filed, it is likely some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others
are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The
benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management
believes it is more-likely-than-not the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation
processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement
with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount described
above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest
and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits is
classified as interest expense and penalties are classified in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.
Earnings
Per Share
The
Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments
to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings
of the Company.
As
of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the Company does not have any potentially dilutive instrument.
Contingencies
Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which could result in a loss to the Company which will be resolved
when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such
assessment inherently involves judgment. In assessing loss contingencies arising from legal proceedings pending against the Company or
unasserted claims that may rise from such proceedings, the Company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings
or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.
If
the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable a material loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated, then the estimated loss is accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a material loss
contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability,
together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
Fair
Value Measurements
Fair
value accounting establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. Fair value, which
is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. This framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:
●
Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
●
Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.
●
Level
3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.
The
Company’s financial instruments consisted of cash, accounts payable, contract liability and loan from a shareholder. The estimated
fair value of those balances approximates its carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments.

Accounting
Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted
Credit
Losses
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, (Topic 326), Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments which amends the current accounting guidance and requires the use of the new forward-looking “expected loss”
model, rather than the “incurred loss” model, which requires all expected losses to be determined based on historical experience,
current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This guidance amends the accounting for credit losses for most financial
assets and certain other instruments including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments.
In
November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10 to postpone the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for public business entities eligible
to be smaller reporting companies (SRCs) as defined by the SEC. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for SRCs for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13
on its financial position and results of operations.
There
were other updates recently issued. The management does not believe that other than disclosed above, accounting pronouncements the recently
issued but not yet adopted will have a material impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows.
NOTE

GOING CONCERN
The
Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred
a net loss of $ 29,397 . The Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 269,099
as of December 31, 2022 and negative working capital of $ 79,493 .
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve
its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely
basis, obtain additional working capital funds from the majority shareholder and President of the Company to eliminate inefficiencies
in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient
to fund the Company’s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements.
The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Lease
The
Company has been provided office space by its President at no cost. The management determined that such cost is immaterial and did not
recognize the rent expense in its financial statements.
Loan
from shareholder
In
August 2019, the Company borrowed $ 71,000
from the President of the Company, which bears no interest with a maturity in
December 2021 .
During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company repaid $ 17,000
to the President of the Company after the Company borrowed $ 5,000
in
May 2021. On December 29, 2022 and 2021, the Company and our President verbally amended the loan agreement and extend the maturity date
to
December 31, 2023 .
During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed additional $ 5,400
and $ 17,300
from the President of the Company to sustain its daily operation. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the outstanding balances of shareholder
loan were $ 76,300
and
59,000 ,
respectively.
NOTE

CONTRACT LIABILITIES
Contract
liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the advertisement contracts and will be realized when the
associated performance are performed, and revenue is recognized. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022,
contract liabilities were $ 4,000
and $ 5,600 ,
respectively.
NOTE
6 –
INCOME TAX
The
Company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to
generate taxable income in future periods. The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against
deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In
future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts
to be more likely than not.
Net
operation losses (“NOLs”) can be carried forever based on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . As of March 31, 2022 and December
31, 2022, deferred tax assets resulted from NOLs of approximately $ 31,323
and $ 39,778 , which was fully off-set by valuation allowance
reserved.

Overview
Achison
Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on December 29, 2014.
On
July 1, 2019, Lansdale Inc, the principal stockholder of the Company (“Seller”) and controlled by the Company’s prior
President, Mr. Wanjun Xie, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Dazhong 368 Inc, (the “Buyer”),
pursuant to which, a total of 9,000,000 shares of Class A common stock of the Company were transferred to the Buyer, representing approximately
90% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock, resulting in a change of the control of the Company.
Mr. Dingshan Zhang was appointed as the President and CEO of the Company at the same date.
Prior
to July of 2019 the Company primarily engaged in trading spot gold and silver in Singapore Markets, crypto currency and US equity stocks.
Currently, the Company currently engages only in internet advertising through www.dazhong368.com (the “Website”) in the New
York area and has plans to seek other profitable business at the same time.
Results
of Operation for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company generated revenue in the amount of $4,000 and $1,400, respectively. The
increase was mainly due to our growing online advertising business. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
incurred operating expenses of $10,772 and $20,210, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to the decreasing in professional fees.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net loss was ($6,772) and ($19,310), respectively. The decrease in net loss
was mainly due to the increase in our total revenues together with the decrease in our total operating expenses for the three months
ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021.
Results
of Operation for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company generated revenue in the amount of $12,400 and $5,000, respectively. The
increase was mainly due to our growing online advertising business. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
incurred operating expenses of $41,797 and $45,253, respectively. The decrease was due to the decrease in professional fee. For the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net loss was $29,397 and $39,779, respectively. The decrease in net loss was mainly due
to the increase in sales and decrease in operating expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021.
Equity
and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $269,099. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash of $901 and negative working capital
of $79,493, compared to cash of $14,269 and a negative working capital of $50,331 on March 31, 2022. The decrease in the working capital
was primarily due to cash used to pay for operating expenses. These factors and our ability to raise additional capital to accomplish
our objectives, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
14
Going
Concern Assessment
The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated
deficit and other adverse key financial ratios.
Management’s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve
its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely
basis, obtain additional working capital funds from the majority shareholder and the President of the Company to eliminate inefficiencies
in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient
to fund the Company’s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements.
The
unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going
concern.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The
critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere in
this 10-Q report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable
financial information about our operating results and financial condition

As

4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order
to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures.
The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls’ objectives and design,
the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject
to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that there were material weakness in
our internal controls over Financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and they were therefore not as effective as they could be to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
The material weakness in our controls and procedure were lack of US GAAP knowledge and segregation duties. Management does not believe
that any of these material weaknesses materially affected the results and accuracy of its financial statements. However, in view of this
discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d)
of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
