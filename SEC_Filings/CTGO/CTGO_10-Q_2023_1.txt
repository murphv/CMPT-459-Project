CONTANGO ORE, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.
Organization and Business
Contango ORE, Inc. (“CORE” or the “Company”) engages in exploration for gold ore and associated minerals in Alaska.  The Company conducts its operations through
three
primary means:
●
a
30.0 % membership interest in Peak Gold, LLC (the “Peak Gold JV”), which leases approximately
675,000
acres from the Tetlin Tribal Council and holds approximately
13,000
additional acres of State of Alaska mining claims (such combined acreage, the “Peak Gold JV Property”) for exploration and development, including in connection with the Peak Gold JV's plan to mine ore from the Peak and North Peak deposits within the Peak Gold JV Property (the “Manh Choh Project”);
●
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alaska Gold Torrent, LLC, an Alaska limited liability company (“AGT”), which leases the mineral rights to approximately
8,600
acres of State of Alaska and patented mining claims for exploration from Alaska Hard Rock, Inc., located in
three
former producing gold mines located on the patented claims in the Willow Mining District about
75
miles north of Anchorage, Alaska (the “Lucky Shot Property”) (See Note
10  - Acquisition of Lucky Shot Property); and
●
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Contango Minerals Alaska, LLC (“Contango Minerals”), which separately owns the mineral rights to approximately
145,280
acres of State of Alaska mining claims for exploration, including (i) approximately
69,780
acres located immediately northwest of the Peak Gold JV Property (the “Eagle/Hona Property”), (ii) approximately
14,800
acres located northeast of the Peak Gold JV Property (the “Triple Z Property”), (iii) approximately
52,700
acres of new property in the Richardson district of Alaska  (the “Shamrock Property”) and (iv) approximately
8,000
acres located to the north and east of the Lucky Shot Property (the “Willow Property” and, together with the Eagle/Hona Property,  the Triple Z Property, and the Shamrock Property, collectively the “Minerals Property”).  The Company relinquished approximately
69,000
acres located on the Eagle/Hona prospect in
November 2022.
The Lucky Shot Property and the Minerals Property are collectively referred to in these Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as the “Contango Properties”.
The Company’s Manh Choh Project is in the development stage.  All other projects are in the exploration stage.
The Company has been involved, directly and through the Peak Gold JV, in exploration on the Manh Choh Project for  twelve  years, which has resulted in identifying  two  mineral deposits (Main and North Manh Choh) and several other gold, silver, and copper prospects.  The Peak Gold JV plans to mine ore from the Main and North Manh Choh deposits and then process the ore at the existing Fort Knox mining and milling complex located approximately  240  miles ( 400
km) away. The use of the Fort Knox facilities is expected to accelerate the development of the Peak Gold JV Property and result in reduced upfront capital development costs, smaller environmental footprint, a shorter permitting and development timeline and less overall execution risk for the Peak Gold JV to advance the Main and North Manh Choh deposits to production.  The Peak Gold JV will be charged a toll for using the Fort Knox facilities.  A toll milling agreement is expected to be finalized during the current calendar year.
The Management Committee of the Peak Gold JV (the "Management Committee") approved a calendar year
2022
budget which covered the following areas of work: feasibility study, permitting, on-going environmental monitoring, community engagement, engineering, road and camp construction, and exploration.  Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”) released a combined feasibility study for the Fort Knox mill and the Peak Gold JV in
July 2022.
Also, in
July 2022,
Kinross announced that its board of directors (the “Kinross Board”) made a decision to proceed with development of the Manh Choh project.  Effective
December 31, 2022,
CORE Alaska, KG Mining and the Peak Gold JV executed the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Peak Gold JV (the “A&R JV LLCA Amendment”). The A&R JV LLCA Amendment provides that, beginning in
2023,
the budget of the Peak Gold JV shall be determined on a quarterly basis.  The Management Committee has approved a budget of $ 13.6
million for the
first
calendar quarter of
2023,
of which the Company's share is $ 2.7
million.  To date the Company, has funded $ 1
million of the approved
first
calendar quarter budget.  This budget primarily relates to access road construction and costs incurred for the refurbishment and expansion of the Manh Choh Camp.   The Manh Choh camp facilities, located in Tok, Alaska, have now been completed and construction work on the road will continue through the winter months.  The Mine Operating permit issued by the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources has been submitted.  Once issued mine site construction and mine development of the Manh Choh project site can be undertaken so that the project remains on schedule for
first
gold production in the
second
half of
2024.
At the Lucky Shot Property, the Company engaged Atkinson Construction and Major Drilling as contractors to execute the  2022  exploration/development program.  The Company completed
29
exploration drill holes on the property.  Drilling began in late
June 2022,
and ended in
November
when activities ceased  in preparation for the winter months. All
29
holes intersected the Lucky Shot vein structure. The Company has engaged a
third -party structural geologist from Oriented Targeted Solutions Inc. to complete a structural analysis of the vein structure based on underground mapping and drill core logging. The Company will release all assay results once the results have been finalized and quality assurance and quality control has been completed.  The Company anticipates completing an initial resource estimate, and then making plans for a follow up program to continue exploration of the Lucky Shot vein structure.  Once a sufficient size and quality of mineralized material has been defined the Company expects to initiate a technical study to determine if commercial mining is viable.
On the Shamrock Property, the Company conducted soil and surface rock chip sampling during  2021.  Follow up trenching and detailed geologic mapping is planned for the summer of  2023.   At the Eagle/Hona Property, the Company carried out a detailed reconnaissance of the northern and eastern portions of the large claim block that had  not  previously been detail sampled. Due to the steep topography, a helicopter was used to execute the program safely.  Follow up geologic mapping and sampling is planned for the summer of  2023.
The Company’s  30.0 % membership interest in the Peak Gold JV, its ownership of AGT and Contango Minerals, and cash on hand constitute substantially all of the Company’s assets.
The Company’s fiscal year end is
June 30.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) for interim financial information, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including instructions to Form
10 -Q and Article
8
of Regulation S- X.
Accordingly, they do
not
include all the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements and notes included in the Company ’s Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
June  30, 2022.
The results of operations for the
three
and
six
months  ended
December 31, 2022  are
not
necessarily indicative of the results that
may
be expected for the fiscal year ending
June  30, 2023.
3.   Liquidity
The Company’s cash needs going forward will primarily relate to capital calls from the Peak Gold JV, exploration of the Contango Properties, and general and administrative expenses of the Company.  If a large budget is undertaken by the Peak Gold JV, and
no
additional financing is obtained, the Company
may
elect
not
to fund its portion of the approved budget and dilute its interest in the Peak Gold JV, in which case management believes the Company would maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital requirements for the next
twelve
months from the date of this report.  If the Company's interest in the Peak Gold JV is diluted, the Company
may
not
be able to fully realize its investment in the Peak Gold JV.  Also, if
no
additional financing is obtained, the Company
may
not
be able to fully realize its investment in the Contango Properties.

The Company’s share of the Peak Gold JV’s results of operations for the
three  and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
was a loss of approximately $ 0.8  million and $ 1.2
million, respectively.   The Company’s share in the results of operations for the
three  and
six
months ended December
31 , 2021  was a loss of approximately $ 0.8
million and $ 1.8
million respectively .   The Peak Gold JV loss does
not
include any provisions related to income taxes as the Peak Gold JV is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes. As of  December 31, 2022  and
June 30, 2022,
the Company’s share of the Peak Gold JV’s inception-to-date cumulative loss of approximately $ 43.2  million and $ 42.0  million, respectively, exceeded the historical book value of our investment in the Peak Gold JV, of $ 28.7
million. Therefore, the investment in the Peak Gold JV had a balance of
zero
as of  each December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022.
The Company is currently obligated to make additional capital contributions to the Peak Gold JV in proportion to its percentage membership interest in the Peak Gold JV in order to maintain its ownership in the Peak Gold JV and
not  be diluted.  Therefore, the Company only records losses up to the point of its cumulative investment, which was approximately $ 28.7  million as of December
31,
2022.
The portion of the cumulative loss that exceeds the Company’s investment will be suspended and recognized against earnings, if any, from the Company’s investment in the Peak Gold JV in future periods.
The suspended losses for the period from inception to
December 31, 2022  are approximately $ 14.5  million.

Prepaid Expenses and other assets
The Company has prepaid expenses and other assets of $ 816,596  and $ 453,353  as of
December 31, 2022  and
June  30,
2022,
respectively. Prepaid expenses primarily relate to prepaid insurance and prepaid annual claim rentals.

Private Placement
On
December 23, 2022
the Company completed the issuance and sale of an aggregate of
283,500
shares (the
“December  2022
Shares”) of the Company’s Common Stock, for $ 20.00
per share, and warrants (the
“December  2022
Warrants”) entitling each purchaser to purchase shares of Common Stock for $ 25.00
per share (the
“December  2022
Warrant Shares” and together with the
December  2022
Shares and the
December  2022
Warrants, the
“December  2022
Securities”), in a private placement (the
“December  2022
Private Placement”) to certain accredited investors (the
“December  2022
Investors”) pursuant to Subscription Agreements (the
“December  2022
Subscription Agreements”), dated as of
December 23, 2022
between the Company and each of the
December  2022
Investors. The
December  2022
Subscription Agreements include customary representations, warranties, and covenants by the
December  2022
Investors and the Company.
Pursuant to the
December  2022
Warrants between the Company and each of the
December  2022
Investors, the
December  2022
Warrants will be exercisable, in full or in part, at any time until the
second
anniversary of their issuance, at an exercise price of $ 25.00
per share of Common Stock. The
December  2022
Warrants will also provide for certain adjustments that
may
be made to the exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise due to future corporate events or otherwise.  The
December 2022
Warrants were classified within equity and the proceeds from the capital raise were allocated to the  warrants based on their relative fair value.   The fair value of each of the
December  2022
Warrants was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level
2  of the fair value hierarchy) with the following weighted average assumptions used: (i) risk-free interest rate of
4.66%;
(ii) expected life of
1
year; (iii) expected volatility of
37.73%;
and (iv) expected dividend yield of
0 %.
Petrie Partners Securities, LLC (“Petrie”) assisted the Company with the
December  2022
Private Placement and will be entitled to receive compensation equal to
3.25
percent for the
December  2022
Investors solicited by Petrie.  Net proceeds from the
December  2022
Private Placement totaled approximately $ 5.6
million. The Company will use these proceeds to fund its exploration and development program and for general corporate purposes. The
December  2022
Securities sold were
not
registered under the Securities Act of
1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act”), but the
December  2022
Shares and the
December  2022
Warrant Shares are subject to a Registration Rights Agreement allowing the shares to be registered by the holders at a future date.
Rights Plan   Termination and Rights Agreement
On
September 23, 2020,  the Company adopted a limited duration stockholder rights agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) to replace the Company’s prior stockholder rights plan, which was terminated upon adoption of the Rights Agreement.
Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the Board declared a dividend of  one  preferred stock purchase right (a “Right”) for each share of the Company’s Common Stock held of record as of
October 5, 2020.   The Rights will trade with the Company’s Common Stock and  no  separate Rights certificates will be issued, unless and until the Rights become exercisable. In general, the Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of  18.0 % (or  20.0 % for certain passive investors) or more of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in beneficial ownership of  18.0%  (or  20.0%  for certain passive investors) or more of Common Stock. Each Right will entitle the holder to buy  one one -thousandth ( 1/1000 ) of a share of a series of junior preferred stock at an exercise price of $ 100.00  per Right, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.
The Rights Agreement had an initial term of  one  year, expiring on
September 22, 2021.   On
September 21, 2021,  the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Rights Agreement, extending the term of the Rights Agreement by an additional year to
September 22, 2022.
On
August 31, 2022,
the Board of Directors approved an amendment the Rights Agreement, extending the term of the Rights Agreement by an additional year to

Sales Transaction with KG Mining
On
September 29, 2020,
the Company, CORE Alaska, LLC and KG Mining, entered into the CORE Purchase Agreement pursuant to which CORE Alaska sold a
30.0 % membership interest in the Peak Gold JV, to KG Mining. The CORE Transactions closed on
September 30, 2020.   In consideration for the CORE JV Interest, the Company received $ 32.4
million in cash and
809,744
shares of Common Stock. The
809,744
shares of Common Stock were acquired by KG Mining from Royal Gold, as part of the Royal Gold Transactions and were subsequently canceled by the Company. Of the $ 32.4
million cash consideration, $ 1.2
million constituted a reimbursement prepayment to the Company relating to its proportionate share of silver royalty payments that the Peak Gold JV
may
be obligated to pay to Royal Gold, with the understanding that KG Mining will bear the entire economic impact of those royalty payments due from the Peak Gold JV.
Concurrently with the Purchase Agreement, KG Mining, in a separate transaction, acquired from Royal Gold (i)
100 % of the equity of Royal Alaska, LLC , which held a
40.0 % membership interest in the Peak Gold JV and (ii)
809,744
shares of Common Stock held by Royal Gold.  After the consummation of the Kinross Transactions, CORE Alaska retains a
30.0 % membership interest in the Peak Gold JV. KG Mining now holds a
70.0 % membership interest in the Peak Gold JV and serves as the manager and operator of the Peak Gold JV. KG Mining and CORE Alaska entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Peak Gold JV (“A&R JV LLCA”) on
October 1, 2020
to address the new ownership arrangements and to incorporate additional terms that will permit the Peak Gold JV to further develop and produce from its properties.
The Company recorded the $ 32.4
million cash proceeds and the
809,744
shares of Common Stock, received from the CORE Transactions, at fair value and recognized a gain on sale of $ 39.6
million.   The Company valued the Common Stock consideration from the CORE Transactions consistent with the accounting guidance for non-monetary exchanges.  The stock consideration was valued based on the implied fair value of the CORE Transactions in total less the cash proceeds.  The total value of the CORE Transactions was equated to the value of the Company's
30.0 % ownership in the Peak Gold JV, post the
30.0%
membership interest transferred to KG Mining.  The Common Stock consideration received in the CORE Transactions is classified within Level
3
of the fair value hierarchy.  As of the date of the CORE Transactions, the Company's investment in the Peak Gold JV had a
zero
balance, therefore the $ 39.6
million gain approximates the full fair value of the CORE JV Interest surrendered in the CORE Transactions.
The Company recorded a non-current liability totaling $ 1.2
million associated with the cash received for the reimbursement prepayment to the Company of its proportionate share of certain silver royalty payments that the Peak Gold JV
may
be obligated to pay Royal Gold.  The liability arises, because pursuant to Article IV of the A&R JV LLCA, if the Peak Gold JV terminates, or the Company’s membership interest falls below
5%
prior to when the prepaid royalty is paid out, the $ 1.2
million (less any portion already paid out) is refundable to KG Mining.
Prior to the CORE Transactions, the Peak Gold JV was a variable interest entity as defined by FASB ASU
No.
2015 - 02,
Consolidation (Topic
810 ): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The Company was  not
the primary beneficiary since it did
not
have the power to direct the activities of the Peak Gold JV. The Company’s ownership interest in the Peak Gold JV has therefore historically applied the equity method of accounting for its investment.   After the Kinross Transactions, the Company retained a
30.0 % membership interest in the Peak Gold JV.  The Company continues to have significant influence in the Peak Gold JV pursuant to its right to designate  one
of the
three
seats on the Management Committee.  Therefore, the Company will continue to account for its investment in the Peak Gold JV under the equity method.

10.   Acquisition of Lucky Shot Property
On
August 24, 2021
the Company completed the purchase of all outstanding membership interests (the “Interests”) of AGT from CRH Funding II PTE. LTD, a Singapore private limited corporation (“CRH”) (the “Lucky Shot Transaction”). AGT holds rights to the Lucky Shot Property.  The Company agreed to purchase the Interests for a total purchase price of up to $ 30
million. The purchase price included an initial payment at closing of $ 5
million in cash and a promissory note in the original principal amount of $ 6.25
million, payable by the Company to CRH (the “Promissory Note”), with a maturity date of
February 28, 2022 ( the “Maturity Date”).  The Promissory Note was secured by the Interests.  The Company had the option to pay the Promissory Note through the issuance to CRH of shares of the Company’s common stock if the Company completed an offering and obtained a listing of its shares on the NYSE American prior to the Maturity Date.  In
November 2021,
the Company’s common stock commenced listing on the NYSE American. Since the Company did
not
complete the required offering, it paid the Promissory Note in cash on
February 25, 2022.
The Company will be obligated to pay CRH additional consideration if production on the Lucky Shot Property meets  two  separate milestone payment thresholds. If the  first  threshold of ( 1 ) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to  500,000  ounces of gold or ( 2 ) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of  30,000  ounces of gold (including any silver based on a  1:65  gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $ 5  million in cash and $ 3.75  million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock. If the  second  threshold of ( 1 ) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to  1,000,000  ounces of gold or ( 2 ) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of  60,000  ounces of gold (including any silver based on a  1:65  gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $ 5  million in cash and $ 5  million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock. If payable, the additional share consideration will be issued based on the  30 -day volume weighted average price for each of the  thirty  trading days immediately prior to the satisfaction of the relevant production goal.  If the milestones are
not
met,
no
additional payments would be made to CRH.
The Company also agreed to make $ 10,000,000  in expenditures during the  36 -month period following closing toward the existence, location, quantity, quality or commercial value of mineral deposits in, under and upon the Lucky Shot Property.   As of
December 31, 2022,
the Company had exceeded the required $ 10,000,000
in expenditures.
The Company evaluated this acquisition under ASC  805,  Business Combinations.  ASC  805  requires that an acquirer determine whether it has acquired a business. If the criteria of ASC  805  are met, a transaction would be accounted for as a business combination and the purchase price is allocated to the respective net assets assumed based on their fair values and a determination is made whether any goodwill results from the transaction.  In evaluating the criteria outlined by this standard, the Company concluded that the acquired set of assets did  not  meet the US GAAP definition of a business (the assembled workforce does  not  currently perform a substantive process).  Therefore, the Company accounted for the purchase as an asset acquisition, and allocated the total consideration transferred on the date of the acquisition, approximately $ 13.5  million, to the assets acquired on a relative fair value basis.  The total consideration transferred was comprised of $ 5.1  million in cash, a $ 6.25  million promissory note, $ 0.3  million in direct transactions costs, plus the fair value of the contingent liability (described above), net of cash received.  The Company accounted for the share portion of the contingent liability in accordance with ASC  480  and measured at fair value at inception, approximately $ 1.85  million. The fair value of this liability was calculated using management’s projected timing of mining activities and mineral resources being defined and an estimate of the probability of achieving those targets.  The share portion of the contingent consideration is classified within Level  3  of the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in value in subsequent periods, based on management’s ongoing assessment of probability, will be recorded in earnings. There was
no
change in probability, and thus
no
change in value of the liability during the current period.  The Company’s accounting policy is to recognize the contingent consideration associated with cash contingent payments related to the asset acquisitions when the contingency is resolved. Any amounts issued in excess of the contingent consideration initially recognized as a liability would be an additional cost of the asset acquisition allocated to increase the eligible assets on a relative fair value basis.  Amounts issued that are less than the contingent consideration initially recognized as a liability would be a reduction of the cost of the asset(s) acquired and would reduce the eligible assets on a relative value basis.

Related Party Transactions
On
January 1, 2022,  our non-executive directors realized a vesting of  160,000  restricted shares of Common Stock, which resulted in federal and state income tax obligations.  Consistent with the Company’s treatment of employees who experience similar tax obligations in connection with their vesting of restricted shares, the Company purchased a total of  60,100  shares of Common Stock from the non-executive directors on
January 5, 2022,  at a price of $ 25.60  per share (the applicable closing price per share of Common Stock for vesting on
January 1, 2022),  resulting in aggregate payments of $ 1.5  million that will be used by the non-executive directors to pay their tax obligations on the vested shares.

Equity Compensation Plan (as amended, the “Amended Equity Plan”) which increased the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company may issue under the Amended Equity Plan by
600,000
shares.   Under the Amended Equity Plan, the Board
may
issue up to
2,600,000
shares of Common Stock and options to officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Company. Awards made under the Amended Equity Plan are subject to such restrictions, terms and conditions, including forfeitures, if any, as
may
be determined by the Board.
As of  December 31, 2022,
there were
348,210
shares of unvested restricted Common Stock outstanding and
100,000  options to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding issued under the Equity Plan. Stock-based compensation expense for the
three  and
six
months ended  December 31, 2022   was $ 810,547  and $ 1,598,421 , respectively.    Stock-based compensation expense for the
three  and
six
months ended  December 31, 2021   was $ 1,256,309
and $ 2,278,160 , respectively.  The amount of compensation expense recognized does
not
reflect cash compensation actually received by the individuals during the current period, but rather represents the amount of expense recognized by the Company in accordance with US GAAP.  All restricted stock grants are expensed over the applicable vesting period based on the fair value at the date the stock is granted.  The grant date fair value
may  differ from the fair value on the date the individual’s restricted stock actually vests.
Restricted Stock.
On
December 1, 2020,  the Company granted an aggregate  20,000
shares of Common Stock to
two  new employees.  The restricted stock granted to such employees vests in equal installments over
three
years on the anniversary of the grant date.
As of  December 31, 2022,
6,668
shares of restricted stock granted in
December 2020  remained unvested.
On
August 16, 2021,
the Company granted
10,000
shares of Common Stock to a new employee.  The restricted stock granted to the employee vests in equal installments over
three
years on the anniversary of the grant date.  As of
December 31, 2022,
6,667
shares of restricted stock granted in
August 2021
remain unvested.
On
November 11, 2021,
the Company granted  123,500
restricted shares of Common Stock to its executives and non-executive directors. The restricted stock granted to the executives and non-executive directors vests between
January 2023
and
January 2024.     As of
December 31, 2022,
all
113,500  shares of such restricted stock granted remained unvested.
On
February 2, 2022
the Company also granted to
four
employees a total of  12,000
shares of restricted stock.  These restricted shares will vest between
January 2023
and
January 2025.   As of
December 31, 2022,
all
12,000  shares of such restricted stock granted remained unvested.
In
December 2022,
the Company cancelled
167,500
shares of unvested restricted stock held by executives and the non-executive directors that were set to vest in
January 2023.
The Company also granted
209,375
restricted shares of common stock to its executives and non-executive directors. The restricted shares cancellation and the subsequent new grants were accounted for as modification to the original restricted stock grants.  The incremental fair value will be recognized over the vesting period.  The impact of the modification to the current quarter was immaterial.  All of the restricted stock granted in
December 2022
vest in
January 2025.  As of
December 31, 2022,
there were
209,375
shares of such restricted stock that remained unvested.
As of
December 31, 2022 , the total compensation cost related to unvested awards
not
yet recognized was $ 2,487,376 .  The remaining costs will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the awards.
15
Stock options.   There were
no
stock option exercises during the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022 .  There were also no stock option exercises during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021.    The Company applies the fair value method to account for stock option expense. Under this method, cash flows from the exercise of stock options resulting from tax benefits in excess of recognized cumulative compensation cost (excess
tax benefits) are classified as financing cash flows.
All employee stock option grants are expensed over the stock option’s vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted. The fair value of each option is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model (Level
2  of the fair value hierarchy).   As of
December 31, 2022,
the stock options had a weighted-average remaining life of
2.02
years. All of the compensation cost related to these stock options had been recognized as of
December 31, 2022.
A summary of the status of stock options granted under the Equity Plan as of
December 31, 2022
and changes during the
six  months then ended, is presented in the table below:

Commitments and Contingencies
Tetlin Lease . The Tetlin Lease had an initial ten-year term beginning
July 2008
which was extended for an additional
ten
years to
July 15, 2028,
and for so long thereafter as the Peak Gold JV initiates and continues to conduct mining operations on the Tetlin Lease.
Pursuant to the terms of the Tetlin Lease, the Peak Gold JV was required to spend $ 350,000
per year until
July   15,
2018
in exploration costs. The Company’s exploration expenditures through the
2011
exploration program have satisfied this requirement because exploration funds spent in any year in excess of
$350,000
are credited toward future years’ exploration cost requirements. Additionally, should the Peak Gold JV derive revenues from the properties covered under the Tetlin Lease, the Peak Gold JV is required to pay the Tetlin Tribal Council a production royalty ranging from
3 .0%
to
5.0 %, depending on the type of metal produced and the year of production. The Company previously paid the Tetlin Tribal Council $ 225,000
in exchange for reducing the production royalty payable to them by
0.75 %. These payments lowered the production royalty to a range of
2 .25%
to
4.25 %. The Tetlin Tribal Council had the option to increase their production royalty by (i)
0.25 % by payment to the Peak Gold JV of $ 150,000 , (ii)
0.50 % by payment to the Peak Gold JV of $ 300,000 , or (iii)
0.75 % by payment to the Peak Gold JV of
$450,000.  The Tetlin Tribal Council exercised the option
to increase its production royalty by
0.75%
by payment to the Peak Gold JV of $ 450,000
on
December 30, 2020.
In lieu of a cash payment, the
$450,000
will be credited against future production royalty and advance minimum royalty payments due by the Peak Gold JV to the Tetlin Tribal Council under the lease once production begins.  The exercise of this option by the tribe did
not
have an accounting impact to the Company.  Until such time as production royalties begin, the Peak Gold JV must pay the Tetlin Tribal Council an advance minimum royalty of $ 50,000
per year. On
July  15,
2012,
the advance minimum royalty increased to $ 75,000
per year, and subsequent years are escalated by an inflation adjustment.
Gold Exploration.
The Company’s Triple Z, Eagle/Hona, Shamrock, Willow, and Lucky Shot claims are all located on State of Alaska lands.  The Company released its Bush and West Fork claims in
November 2020.
The annual claim rentals on these projects vary based on the age of the claims, and are due and payable in full by
November  30
of each year. Annual claims rentals for the
2022 - 2023  assessment year totaled
$ 355,805 . The Company paid the current year claim rentals in November
2022.   The associated rental expense is amortized over the rental claim period, September
1
- August
31  of each
year.  As of
December 31, 2022,
the Peak Gold JV had met the annual labor requirements for the State of Alaska acreage for the next
four
years, which is the maximum period allowable by Alaska law.  The Company obtained
100%
ownership of these claims in conjunction with the Separation Agreement.
Lucky Shot Acquisition .  With regard to the Lucky Shot Acquisition, in addition to the cash at closing and the Promissory Note, the Company will be obligated to pay CRH additional consideration if production on the Lucky Shot Property meets
two
separate milestone payment thresholds.  If the
first
threshold of ( 1 ) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to
500,000
ounces of gold or ( 2 ) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of
30,000
ounces of gold (including any silver based on a
1:65
gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $ 5
million in cash and $ 3.75
million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock.  If the
second
threshold of ( 1 ) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to
1,000,000
ounces of gold or ( 2 ) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of
60,000
ounces of gold (including any silver based on a
1:65
gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $ 5
million in cash and $ 5
million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock. If payable, the additional share consideration will be issued based on the
30 -day volume weighted average price for each of the
thirty
trading days immediately prior to the satisfaction of the relevant production goal.
Royal Gold Royalties . Initially, the Peak Gold JV was obligated to pay Royal Gold (i) an overriding royalty of
3.0 % should the Peak Gold JV derive revenues from the Tetlin Lease, the Additional Properties and certain other properties and (ii) an overriding royalty of
2.0 % should the Peak Gold JV derive revenues from certain other properties.  In conjunction with the Separation Agreement (described in Note
9 ), the Peak Gold JV  granted a new
28.0 % net smelter returns silver royalty on all silver produced from a defined area within the Tetlin Lease and transferred an additional
1.0 % net smelter returns royalty on the state mining claims to Royal Gold.  Therefore, Royal Gold currently holds a
3.0 % overriding royalty on the Tetlin Lease and the state mining claims that were transferred to the Company in conjunction with the Separation Agreement.
16
Retention Agreements.  In
February 2019,
the Company entered into Retention Agreements with its then Chief Executive Officer, Brad Juneau, its Chief Financial Officer, Leah Gaines, and
one
other employee providing for payments in an aggregate amount of $ 1,500,000
upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Retention Agreements are triggered upon a change of control (as defined in the applicable Retention Agreement), provided that the recipient is employed by the Company when the change of control occurs. On
February 6, 2020,
the Company entered into amendments to the Retention Agreements to extend the term of the change of control period from
August 6, 2020
until
August 6, 2025.
Mr. Juneau and Ms. Gaines will receive a payment of $ 1,000,000
and $ 250,000 , respectively, upon a change of control that takes place prior to
August 6, 2025.
On
June 10, 2020,
the Company entered into a Retention Payment Agreement with Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, providing for a payment in an amount of $ 350,000
upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Retention Payment Agreement is triggered upon a change of control (as defined in the Retention Payment Agreement) which occurs on or prior to
August 6, 2025,
provided that Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse is employed by the Company when the change of control occurs.
Short Term Incentive Plan . The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Compensation Committee”) adopted a Short-Term Incentive Plan (the “STIP”) effective as of
June 10, 2020,
for the benefit of Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse. Pursuant to the terms of the STIP, the Compensation Committee will establish performance goals each year and evaluate the extent to which, if any, Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse meets such goals. The STIP provides for a payout equal to
25.0 % of Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse’s annual base salary if the minimum performance target established by the Compensation Committee is met,
100.0 % of his annual base salary if all performance goals are met, and up to
200.0 % of his annual base salary if the maximum performance target is met. Amounts due under the STIP will be payable
50.0 % in cash and
50.0 % in the form of restricted stock granted under the Equity Plan, vesting in
two
equal annual installments on the
first
and
second
anniversaries of the grant date, and subject to the terms of the Equity Plan.  In addition, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Equity Plan) during the term of the STIP, the Compensation Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion,
may
make a payment to Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse in an amount up to
200.0 % of his annual base salary, payable in cash, shares of Common Stock of the Company under the Equity Plan or a combination of both, as determined by the Compensation Committee,
not
later than
30
days following such Change of Control.  In conjunction with STIP plan, in
December 2020,
Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse received a $ 350,000
cash bonus and
23,333
restricted shares of Common Stock, which vested on
January 1, 2022.   In conjunction with the STIP plan, in
January 2022,  Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse received a $ 300,000  cash bonus and  15,000  restricted shares of Common Stock, which will vest on
January 15, 2023.    These
15,000
restricted shares were cancelled in
December 2022,
and
18,750
shares were issued to Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse under the STIP plan which will vest in
January 2025.
Roc Global   Financing Fees.
The Company has engaged ROC Global, LLC (“ROC Global”) as a financial advisor and investment banker.  The current term of the engagement is through
March 31, 2023.
If the Company completes or enters into a definitive agreement to complete a debt financing with a party introduced to the Company by ROC Global during the term of the agreement or within the
eighteen
months following the term of the agreement, the Company will pay ROC Global
3.25 % of the gross proceeds received by the Company, before any expenses and fees of the loan transaction and/or the securities of the Company being offered and sold in such a debt financing.
15.   Income Taxes
The Company recognized a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset as of
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022  and has recognized
zero  income tax expense for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022.
The Company recognized
zero
income tax expense for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2021.  The effective tax rate was
0 % for the
three
and
six
months ending
December 31, 2022
and
2021.   The Company has historically had a full valuation allowance, which resulted in
no
net deferred tax asset or liability appearing on its statement of financial position. The Company recorded this valuation allowance after an evaluation of all available evidence (including the Company's history of net operating losses) that led to a conclusion that, based upon the more-likely-than- not
standard of the accounting literature, these deferred tax assets were unrecoverable. The Company is forecasting a book and taxable net loss for its fiscal year end,
June 30, 2023.   The Company reviews its tax positions quarterly for tax uncertainties. The Company did
not
have any uncertain tax positions as of  December 31, 2022
or
June 30, 2022.
On
March 27, 2020,
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES” Act) was enacted which is aimed at providing emergency assistance due to the impact of the COVID- 19
pandemic. The CARES Act includes provisions related to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax deprecation methods for qualified improvement property. The Company does
not
expect to be materially impacted by the CARES Act and does
not
anticipate the CARES Act to have a material effect on its ability to realize deferred tax assets with the exception of the relief from the
80%
limitation on some of its net operating losses that were fully utilized for the tax year ended
June 30, 2021.
16.
Debt
On
April 26, 2022 ,  the Company closed on a $ 20,000,000  unsecured convertible debenture to Queen’s Road Capital Investment, Ltd. (“QRC”).  The Company will use the proceeds from the sale of the debenture to fund commitments to the Peak Gold JV, the exploration and development at its Lucky Shot properties, and for general corporate purposes.
The debenture bears interest at  8 % per annum, payable quarterly, with  6 % paid in cash and  2 % paid in shares of Common Stock issued at the market price at the time of payment based on a  20 -day volumetric weighted average price (“VWAP”). The debenture is unsecured, with a maturity of  four  year s
after issuance. The holder
may  convert the debenture into Common Stock at any time at a conversion price of $ 30.50  per share (equivalent to
655,738
shares), subject to adjustment. The Company
may  redeem the debenture after the  third  anniversary of issuance at  105 % of par, provided that the market price (based on a  20 -day VWAP) of the Company's Common Stock is at least  130 % of the conversion price. The Company
may  also redeem the debenture, and the holder will have rights to put the debenture to the Company, upon a change of control of the Company, with the redemption or put price being  130 % of par for the  first   three  years following issuance and  115 % of par thereafter and accrued interest at the time of redemption or put being paid in the same form as other interest payments.  Upon the completion of a secured financing the holder has the right to require the Company to redeem the debenture.  Additionally, upon announcement of a change of control, the Company has the right to require the holder to convert some or the whole principal amount of the debenture into shares at the conversion price, subject to certain conditions.
In connection with the issuance of the debenture, the Company agreed to pay an establishment fee of  3 % of the debenture face amount. In accordance with the investment agreement, QRC elected to receive the establishment fee in shares of Common Stock valued at $ 24.82  per share, for a total of  24,174  shares. The establishment fee shares were issued to QRC pursuant to an exemption from registration under Regulation S.  QRC entered into an investor rights agreement with the Company in connection with the issuance of the debenture. The investor rights agreement contains provisions that require QRC and its affiliates, while they own  5 % or more of our outstanding Common Stock, to standstill,  not  to participate in any unsolicited or hostile takeover of the Company,  not  to tender its shares of Common Stock unless the Company’s board recommends such tender, to vote its shares of Common Stock in the manner recommended by the Company’s board to its stockholders, and  not  to transfer its shares of Common Stock representing more than  0.5 % of outstanding shares without notifying the Company in advance, whereupon the Company will have a right to purchase those shares.
The debt carried an original issue discount of $ 0.6
million and debt issuance costs of approximately $ 0.2
million.  As of
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022,
the unamortized discount and issuance costs were $ 0.5  million and $ 0.1  million, respectively.  The carrying amount of the debt at
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022,
net of the unamortized discount and issuance costs, was $ 19.4  million and $ 19.2
million, respectively.  The fair value of the note (Level
2 ) as of
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022
was $ 20.0
million.  The company recognized interest expense totaling $ 0.4  million related to this debt for the quarter ended
December 31, 2022 ( inclusive of approximately $ 400,000
of contractual interest, and approximately $ 47,000
related to the amortization of the discount and issuance fees).  The company recognized interest expense totaling $ 0.9  million related to this debt for the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022 ( inclusive of approximately $ 800,000
of contractual interest, and approximately $ 96,000
related to the amortization of the discount and issuance fees).  The interest paid in stock during the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
was issued from shares held in the Company's Treasury account.  The effective interest rate of the note is the same as the stated interest rate,
8.0 %.  The effective interest rate for the amortization of the discount and issuance costs as of
June 30, 2022
was
1.0 %.  The Company reviewed the provisions of the debt agreement to determine if the agreement included any embedded features.  The Company concluded that the change of control provisions within the debt agreement met the characteristics of a derivative and required bifurcation and separate accounting.  The fair value of the identified derivative was determined to be de minimus at
April 26, 2022,
June 30, 2022,
and
December 31, 2022
as the probability of a change of control was negligible as of those dates.   For each subsequent reporting period, the Company will evaluate each potential derivative feature to conclude whether or
not
they qualify for derivative accounting. Any derivatives identified will be recorded at the applicable fair value as of the end of each reporting period.

17.   Subsequent Events

Petrie assisted the Company with the
January  2023
Private Placement and will be entitled to receive compensation equal to
3.25

You should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements in this report, as they speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  All forward-looking statements included herein are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.
Overview
The Company engages in exploration for gold ore and associated minerals in Alaska.  The Company conducts its operations through three primary means:
●
a 30.0% membership interest in Peak Gold, LLC (the “Peak Gold JV”), which leases approximately 675,000 acres from the Tetlin Tribal Council and holds approximately 13,000 additional acres of State of Alaska mining claims (such combined acreage, the “Peak Gold JV Property”) for exploration and development, including in connection with the Peak Gold JV's plan to mine ore from the Peak and North Peak deposits within the Peak Gold JV Property (the “Manh Choh Project”);
●
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alaska Gold Torrent, LLC, an Alaska limited liability company (“AGT”), which leases the mineral rights to approximately 8,600 acres of State of Alaska and patented mining claims for exploration from Alaska Hard Rock, Inc., located in three former producing gold mines located on the patented claims in the Willow Mining District about 75 miles north of Anchorage, Alaska (the “Lucky Shot Property”) (See Note 10 - Acquisition of Lucky Shot Property); and
●
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Contango Minerals Alaska, LLC (“Contango Minerals”), which separately owns the mineral rights to approximately 145,280 acres of State of Alaska mining claims for exploration, including (i) approximately 69,780 acres located immediately northwest of the Peak Gold JV Property (the “Eagle/Hona Property”), (ii) approximately 14,800 acres located northeast of the Peak Gold JV Property (the “Triple Z Property”), (iii) approximately 52,700 acres of new property in the Richardson district of Alaska  (the “Shamrock Property”) and (iv) approximately 8,000 acres located to the north and east of the Lucky Shot Property (the “Willow Property” and, together with the Eagle/Hona Property,  the Triple Z Property, and the Shamrock Property, collectively the “Minerals Property”).  The Company relinquished approximately 69,000 acres located on the Eagle/Hona prospect in November 2022.   The Company retained essentially all of the acreage where drilling work was performed in 2019 and 2021, and used sampling data to determine which acreage should be released.
The Lucky Shot Property and the Minerals Property are collectively referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as the “Contango Properties”.
The Company’s Manh Choh Project is in the development stage.  All other projects are in the exploration stage.
The Company has been involved, directly and through the Peak Gold JV, in exploration on the Manh Choh Project for twelve years, which has resulted in identifying two mineral deposits (Main and North Manh Choh) and several other gold, silver, and copper prospects.  The Peak Gold JV plans to mine ore from the Main and North Manh Choh deposits and then process the ore at the existing Fort Knox mining and milling complex located approximately 240 miles (400 km) away. The use of the Fort Knox facilities is expected to accelerate the development of the Peak Gold JV Property and result in reduced upfront capital development costs, smaller environmental footprint, a shorter permitting and development timeline and less overall execution risk for the Peak Gold JV to advance the Main and North Manh Choh deposits to production.  The Peak Gold JV will be charged a toll for using the Fort Knox facilities.  A toll milling agreement is expected to be finalized during the current calendar year.
The Management Committee of the Peak Gold JV (the "Management Committee") approved a calendar year 2022 budget which covered the following areas of work: feasibility study, permitting, on-going environmental monitoring, community engagement, engineering, road and camp construction, and exploration.  Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”) released a combined feasibility study for the Fort Knox mill and the Peak Gold JV in July 2022.  Also, in July 2022, Kinross announced that its board of directors (the “Kinross Board”) made a decision to proceed with development of the Manh Choh project.  Effective December 31, 2022, CORE Alaska, KG Mining and the Peak Gold JV executed the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Peak Gold JV (the “A&R JV LLCA Amendment”). The A&R JV LLCA Amendment provides that, beginning in 2023, the budget of the Peak Gold JV shall be determined on a quarterly basis.  The Management Committee has approved a budget of $13.6 million for the first calendar quarter of 2023, of which the Company's share is $2.7 million.  To date the Company, has funded $1 million of the approved first calendar quarter budget.  This budget primarily relates to access road construction and costs incurred for the refurbishment and expansion of the Manh Choh Camp.   The Manh Choh camp facilities, located in Tok, Alaska, have now been completed and construction work on the road will continue through the winter months.  The Mine Operating permit issued by the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources has been submitted.  Once issued mine site construction and mine development of the Manh Choh project site can be undertaken so that the project remains on schedule for first gold production in the second half of 2024.
At the Lucky Shot Property, the Company engaged Atkinson Construction and Major Drilling as contractors to execute the 2022 exploration/development program.  The Company completed 29 exploration drill holes on the property.  Drilling began in late June 2022, and ended in November when activities ceased  in preparation for the winter months. All 29 holes intersected the Lucky Shot vein structure. The Company has engaged a third-party structural geologist from Oriented Targeted Solutions Inc. to complete a structural analysis of the vein structure based on underground mapping and drill core logging. The Company will release all assay results once the results have been finalized and quality assurance and quality control has been completed.  The Company anticipates completing an initial resource estimate, and then making plans for a follow up program to continue exploration of the Lucky Shot vein structure.  Once a sufficient size and quality of mineralized material has been defined the Company expects to initiate a technical study to determine if commercial mining is viable.
On the Shamrock Property, the Company conducted soil and surface rock chip sampling during 2021. Follow up trenching and detailed geologic mapping is planned for the summer of 2023.  At the Eagle/Hona Property, the Company carried out a detailed reconnaissance of the northern and eastern portions of the large claim block that had not previously been detail sampled. Due to the steep topography, a helicopter was used to execute the program safely.  Follow up geologic mapping and sampling is planned for the summer of 2023.
The Company’s 30.0% membership interest in the Peak Gold JV, its ownership of AGT and Contango Minerals, and cash on hand constitute substantially all of the Company’s assets.

Kinross Transaction
On September 29, 2020, the Company, CORE Alaska, LLC and KG Mining (Alaska), Inc. (“KG Mining”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Kinross Gold Corporation, a corporation formed under the laws of Ontario, Canada (“Kinross”), entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “CORE Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which CORE Alaska sold a 30.0% membership interest (the “CORE JV Interest”) in the Peak Gold JV, to KG Mining (the “CORE Transactions”). The CORE Transactions closed on December 31, 2020.  In consideration for the CORE JV Interest, the Company received $32.4 million in cash and 809,744 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”). The 809,744 shares of Common Stock were acquired by KG Mining from Royal Gold, as part of the Royal Gold Transactions (described below) and were subsequently canceled by the Company. Of the $32.4 million cash consideration, $1.2 million constituted a reimbursement prepayment to the Company by KG Mining of amounts relating to CORE Alaska’s proportionate share of certain silver royalty payments that the Peak Gold JV may be obligated to pay to Royal Gold, with the understanding that as a result of such reimbursements, KG Mining would bear the entire economic impact of those silver royalty payments due from the Peak Gold JV.  Concurrently with the CORE Purchase Agreement, KG Mining, in a separate transaction, acquired from Royal Gold (i) 100% of the equity of Royal Alaska, LLC (“Royal Alaska”), which held a 40.0% membership interest in the Peak Gold JV (the “Royal Gold Transactions” and, together with the CORE Transactions, the “Kinross Transactions”).  Therefore, as of December 31, 2022, the Company holds a 30.0% membership interest in the Peak Gold JV, and KG Mining holds a 70.0% membership interest in the Peak Gold JV and serves as the manager and operator of the Peak Gold JV. KG Mining and CORE Alaska entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Peak Gold JV (the “A&R JV LLCA”) on October 1, 2020 to address the new ownership arrangements and to incorporate additional terms that will permit the Peak Gold JV to further develop and produce from its properties.
The Peak Gold JV had also historically held certain State of Alaska unpatented mining claims for the exploration of gold ore and associated minerals.  Prior to the Kinross Transactions, the Peak Gold JV, Contango Minerals Alaska, LLC, an Alaska limited liability company formed by the Peak Gold JV (“Contango Minerals”), the Company, CORE Alaska, Royal Gold and Royal Alaska entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Peak Gold JV formed Contango Minerals, contributed approximately 167,000 acres of Alaska State mining claims to it, subject to the Option Agreement (described below), and retained an additional 1.0% net smelter returns royalty interest on certain of the Alaska state mining claims that were contributed. After the formation and contribution to Contango Minerals, the Peak Gold JV made simultaneous distributions to Royal Alaska and CORE Alaska by (i) granting a new 28.0% net smelter returns silver royalty on all silver produced from a defined area within the Tetlin Lease and transferring the additional 1.0% net smelter returns royalty described above to Royal Gold and (ii) assigning 100.0% of the membership interests in Contango Minerals to CORE Alaska, which were in turn distributed to the Company, resulting in Contango Minerals becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Separation Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants.
In connection with the Separation Agreement, the Peak Gold JV and Contango Minerals entered into an Option Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Option Agreement”). Under the Option Agreement, Contango Minerals granted the Peak Gold JV an option, subject to certain conditions contained in the Option Agreement, to purchase approximately 13,000 acres of the Alaska state mining claims which were contributed to Contango Minerals pursuant to the Separation Agreement, together with all extralateral rights, water and water rights, and easements and rights of way in connection therewith, that are held by Contango Minerals.  Subject to the conditions in the Option Agreement, the Peak Gold JV had the right to exercise the option to purchase the Alaska state mining claims, in whole or in part, at an exercise price of $50,000. The Peak Gold JV exercised this option in whole in June 2021 and paid the Company $50,000.
Effective December 31, 2022, CORE Alaska, KG Mining and the Peak Gold JV executed the First Amendment to the A&R JV LLCA (the “A&R JV LLCA Amendment”). The A&R JV LLCA Amendment provides that, beginning in 2023, the budget of the Peak Gold JV shall be determined on a quarterly basis.
Kinross is a large gold producer with a diverse global portfolio and extensive operating experience in Alaska. The Peak Gold JV plans to mine ore from the Peak and North Peak deposits and then process ore at the existing Fort Knox mining and milling complex located approximately 250 miles away. The use of the Fort Knox mill is expected to accelerate the development of the Peak Gold JV Property and result in reduced upfront capital development costs, smaller environmental footprint, a shorter permitting and development timeline and less overall risk for Peak Gold JV Property.
Acquisition of Lucky Shot Property
On August 24, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of all outstanding membership interests (the “Interests”) of AGT from CRH Funding II PTE. LTD, a Singapore private limited corporation (“CRH”) (the “Lucky Shot Transaction”). AGT holds rights to the Lucky Shot Property.  The Company agreed to purchase the Interests for a total purchase price of up to $30 million. The purchase price included an initial payment at closing of $5 million in cash and a promissory note in the original principal amount of $6.25 million, payable by the Company to CRH (the “Promissory Note”), with a maturity date of February 28, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”).  The Promissory Note was secured by the Interests.  The Company had the option to pay the Promissory Note through the issuance to CRH of shares of the Company’s common stock if the Company completed an offering and obtained a listing of its shares on the NYSE American prior to the Maturity Date.  In November 2021, the Company’s common stock commenced listing on the NYSE American. Since the Company did not complete the required offering, it paid the Promissory Note in cash on February 25, 2022.
In addition to the cash at closing and the Promissory Note, the Company will be obligated to pay CRH additional consideration if production on the Lucky Shot Property meets two separate milestone payment thresholds.  If the first threshold of (1) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to 500,000 ounces of gold or (2) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of 30,000 ounces of gold (including any silver based on a 1:65 gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $5 million in cash and $3.75 million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock.  If the second threshold of (1) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to 1,000,000 ounces of gold or (2) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of 60,000 ounces of gold (including any silver based on a 1:65 gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $5 million in cash and $5 million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock. If payable, the additional share consideration will be issued based on the 30-day volume weighted average price for each of the thirty trading days immediately prior to the satisfaction of the relevant production goal.
The Company also agreed to make $10,000,000 in expenditures during the 36-month period following closing toward the existence, location, quantity, quality or commercial value of mineral deposits in, under and upon the Lucky Shot Property.  On August 16, 2021, the Company hired Chris Kennedy, who has prior experience in underground mine operations management, to serve as the Company's Mine General Manager. In his role, Mr. Kennedy will manage the Company's underground exploration and development program on the Lucky Shot Property.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company had exceeded the $10.0 million in required expenditures.

Strategy
Retaining Proven Executive Leadership .  Effective as of January 6, 2020, Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse was appointed to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse will perform the functions of the Company’s principal executive officer.  Also effective on January 6, 2020, the size of the Board was increased from four to five directors with Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse appointed to the Board to fill the vacancy created by the increase.  Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse, 65, previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Trilogy Metals Inc. from January 2012 until December 2019. Between May 1999 and January of 2012, he served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of NOVAGOLD Resources, Inc.
Partnering with strategic industry participants to expand future exploration work.   As of October 1, 2020, in conjunction with the Kinross Transactions and the signing of the A&R JV LLCA, KG Mining became the manager of the Peak Gold JV (the “Manager”).  KG Mining may resign as Manager and can be removed as Manager for a material breach of the A&R JV LLCA, a material failure to perform its obligations as the Manager, a failure to conduct the Peak Gold JV operations in accordance with industry standards and applicable laws, and other limited circumstances.  Except as expressly delegated to the Manager, the A&R JV LLCA provides that the Management Committee has exclusive authority to determine all management matters related to the Company. The Management Committee currently consists of one appointee designated by the Company and two appointees designated by KG Mining.  The Representatives designated by each member of the Peak Gold JV vote as a group, and in accordance with their respective membership interests in the Peak Gold JV. Except in the case of certain actions that require approval by unanimous vote of the Representatives, the affirmative vote of a majority of the membership interests in the Peak Gold JV constitutes the action of the Management Committee.
Structuring Incentives to Drive Behavior . The Company believes that equity ownership aligns the interests of the Company’s executives and directors with those of its stockholders. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s directors and executives beneficially own approximately 22.3% of the Company’s Common Stock.
Acquiring exploration properties .  The Company anticipates from time to time acquiring additional properties in Alaska for exploration, subject to the availability of funds. The acquisitions may include leases or similar rights from Alaska Native corporations or may include filing Federal or State of Alaska mining claims by staking claims for exploration. Acquiring additional properties will likely result in additional expense to the Company for minimum royalties, minimum rents and annual exploratory work requirements.  The Company is open to strategic partnerships or alliances with other companies as a means to enhance its ability to fund new and existing exploration and development opportunities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Contractual Obligations
The Tetlin Lease had an initial ten year term beginning July 2008 which was extended for an additional ten years to July 15, 2028, or so long as the Peak Gold JV initiates and continues to conduct mining operations on the Tetlin Lease. The Peak Gold JV was required to spend $350,000 per year annually until July  15, 2018 in exploration costs pursuant to the Tetlin Lease. Exploration expenditures to date under the Tetlin Lease have satisfied this work commitment requirement for the full lease term, through 2028, because exploration funds spent in any year in excess of $350,000 are credited toward future years’ exploration cost requirements. The Tetlin Lease also provides that the Peak Gold JV will pay the Tetlin Tribal Council a production royalty ranging from 3.0% to 5.0% should the Peak Gold JV deliver to a purchaser on a commercial basis precious or non-precious metals derived from the properties under the Tetlin Lease. The Company had previously paid the Tetlin Tribal Council $225,000 in exchange for reducing the production royalty payable to them by 0.75%. These payments lowered the production royalty to a range of 2.25% to 4.25%. On or before December 30, 2020, the Tetlin Tribal Council had the option to increase its production royalty by (i) 0.25% by payment to the Peak Gold JV of $150,000, (ii) 0.50% by payment to the Peak Gold JV of $300,000, or (iii) 0.75% by payment to the Peak Gold JV of $450,000.  The Tetlin Tribal Council exercised the option
to increase its production royalty by 0.75% by payment to the Peak Gold JV of $450,000
on December 30, 2020.  In lieu of a cash payment, the $450,000 will be credited against future production royalty and advance minimum royalty payments due by the Peak Gold JV to the Tetlin Tribal Council under the lease once production begins.
On January 8, 2015, the Company assigned the Tetlin Lease to the Peak Gold JV in connection with the formation of the Peak Gold JV.
Until such time as production royalties begin, the Peak Gold JV will pay the Tetlin Tribal Council an advance minimum royalty of approximately $75,000 per year, plus an inflation adjustment. Additionally, the Peak Gold JV will pay Royal Gold an overriding royalty of 3.0% should it deliver to a purchaser on a commercial basis gold or associated minerals derived from the Tetlin Lease, and a 28.0% net smelter returns silver royalty on all silver produced from a defined area within the Tetlin Lease.  The Company will pay Royal Gold an overriding royalty of 3.0% on certain State of Alaska mining claims should it deliver to a purchaser on a commercial basis precious metals, non-precious metals or hydrocarbons. The Company pays claim rentals on State of Alaska mining claims which vary based on the ages of the claims. For the 2022–2023 assessment year, claims rentals totaled $355,805. Also, if the minimum work requirement is not performed on the property, additional minimum labor payments are due on certain state of Alaska acreage.
In February 2019, the Company entered into Retention Agreements with its then-Chief Executive Officer, Brad Juneau, its Chief Financial Officer, Leah Gaines, and one other employee providing for payments in an aggregate amount of $1,500,000 upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Retention Agreements, as amended, are triggered upon a change of control (as defined in the applicable Retention Agreement), that takes place prior to August 6, 2025, provided that the recipient is employed by the Company when the change of control occurs.  Mr. Juneau and Ms. Gaines will receive a payment of $1,000,000 and $250,000, respectively, upon a change of control.
On June 10, 2020, the Company entered into a Retention Payment Agreement with Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, providing for a payment in an amount of $350,000 upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Retention Payment Agreement is triggered upon a change of control (as defined in the Retention Payment Agreement) which occurs on or prior to August 6, 2025, provided that Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse is employed by the Company when the change of control occurs.
The Company received $32.4 million in cash consideration in conjunction with the Kinross Transactions.  Of the $32.4 million, $1.2 million constituted a reimbursement prepayment to the Company relating to its proportionate share of certain silver royalty payments that the Peak Gold JV may be obligated to pay to Royal Gold, with the understanding that KG Mining will bear the entire economic impact of those royalty payments due from the Peak Gold JV.  Pursuant to Article IV of the A&R JV LLCA, if the Peak Gold JV terminates, or the Company’s membership interest falls below 5% prior to when the prepaid royalty is paid out, the $1.2 million (less any portion already paid out) is refundable to KG Mining.
With regard to the Lucky Shot Acquisition, in addition to the cash at closing and the Promissory Note, the Company will be obligated to pay CRH additional consideration if production on the Lucky Shot Property meets two separate milestone payment thresholds.  If the first threshold of (1) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to 500,000 ounces of gold or (2) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of 30,000 ounces of gold (including any silver based on a 1:65 gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $5 million in cash and $3.75 million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock.  If the second threshold of (1) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to 1,000,000 ounces of gold or (2) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of 60,000 ounces of gold (including any silver based on a 1:65 gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $5 million in cash and $5 million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock. If payable, the additional share consideration will be issued based on the 30-day volume weighted average price for each of the thirty trading days immediately prior to the satisfaction of the relevant production goal.  The Company also agreed to make $10,000,000 in expenditures during the 36-month period following closing toward the existence, location, quantity, quality or commercial value of mineral deposits in, under and upon the Lucky Shot Property.   The Company has exceeded the required $10,000,000 in expenditures as of December 31, 2022.

Critical Accounting  Estimates
The discussion and analysis of the Company ’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company has identified below the policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. The Company analyzes its estimates, including those related to its mineral reserve estimates, on a periodic basis and bases its estimates on historical experience, independent third party engineers and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements:
Stock-Based Compensation.
The Company applies the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. Under this method, the Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payments at fair value at the date of grant and amortize the amount over the employee’s service period. Management is required to make assumptions including stock price volatility and employee turnover that are utilized to measure compensation expense.
Investment in the Peak Gold JV.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the investment in the Peak Gold JV, which is accounted for under the equity method. The Company has designated one of the three members of the Management Committee and on December 31, 2022 held a 30.0% ownership interest in the Peak Gold JV. KG Mining serves as the manager of the Peak Gold JV and manages, directs, and controls operations of the Peak Gold JV. The Company recorded its investment at the historical cost of the assets contributed. The cumulative losses of the Peak Gold JV exceed the historical cost of the assets contributed to the Peak Gold JV; therefore, the Company’s investment in the Peak Gold JV as of December 31, 2022 is zero. The portion of the cumulative loss that exceeds the Company’s investment will be suspended and recognized against earnings, if any, from the investment in the Peak Gold JV in future periods.
Business Combinations.   In determining whether an acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition, the Company first determines whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this is the case, the single identifiable asset or the group of similar assets is not deemed to be a business, and is instead deemed to be an asset. If this is not the case, the Company then further evaluates whether the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If so, the Company concludes that the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities is a business.  The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Application of this method of accounting requires that (i) identifiable assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed generally be measured and recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and (ii) the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually.  The Company measures and recognizes asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the assets, which includes transaction costs. Goodwill is not recognized in asset acquisitions. Contingent consideration in asset acquisitions payable in the form of cash is recognized when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable, unless the contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the asset acquisition cost when acquired. Contingent consideration payable in the form of a fixed number of the Company’s own shares is measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and recognized when the issuance of the shares becomes probable. Upon recognition of the contingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets.
Convertible Debenture .  The Company accounts for its convertible debenture in accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options ("ASC 470-20"), which requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.  Debt discount created by the bifurcation of embedded features in the convertible debenture are reflected as a reduction to the related debt liability.  The discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective-interest method.
Derivative Asset/Liability for Embedded Conversion Features.   The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks.  The Company evaluates convertible notes to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be accounted for separately. In circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are evaluated and accounted for separately. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is recorded as either an asset or a liability and marked-to-market each balance sheet date, with the change in fair value recorded in the statements of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. The fair value of the embedded conversion features are estimated using several probability weighted binomial lattice models. The Company estimated the fair value of the convertible notes conversion feature at the time of issuance and subsequent remeasurement dates, utilizing the with-and without method, where the value of the derivative feature is the difference in values between a note simulated with the embedded conversion feature and the value of the same note simulated without the embedded conversion feature. Estimating fair values of embedded conversion features requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors.
Results of Operations
Neither the Company nor the Peak Gold JV has commenced mining or producing commercially marketable minerals. To date, neither the Company nor the Peak Gold JV has generated any revenue from mineral sales or operations. Neither the Company nor the Peak Gold JV has any recurring source of revenue other than  contributions
by the Company and KG Mining to the Peak Gold JV, and, in addition to the consideration received
in the Kinross Transactions, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise capital to fund its future exploration and working capital requirements. In the future, the Peak Gold JV may generate revenue from a combination of mineral sales and other payments resulting from any commercially recoverable minerals from the Peak Gold JV Property. The Company does not expect the Peak Gold JV to generate revenue from mineral sales until at least the second half of 2024 based on KG Mining's current schedule. If the Peak Gold JV Property fails to contain any proven reserves, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected. Other potential sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include external debt, the sale of shares of our stock, joint ventures, or alternative methods such as mergers or sale of our assets. No assurances can be given, however, that the Company will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash. The Company will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and it may never do so.
Three Months Ended December 31, 2022
Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Claim Rentals Expense.   Claim rental expense primarily consists of State of Alaska rental payments and annual labor payments. We recognized claim rental expense of $126,451 compared to $157,163 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.   The Company relinquished approximately 69,000 acres located on the Eagle/Hona prospect in November 2022.
Exploration Expense.
Exploration expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $2.2 million compared to $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.  Current year exploration expense relates primarily to exploration work performed on our Lucky Shot Property.  Lucky Shot was acquired in August 2021, and the development and exploration program did not begin until late 2021.
General and Administrative Expense.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The Company’s general and administrative expense primarily relates to legal fees, management fees, payroll and stock-based compensation expense. The current year decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to the reduction in stock-based compensation expense.   The stock-based compensation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $0.8 million, compared to $1.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.

Loss from Equity Investment in the Peak Gold JV .  The loss from the Company’s equity investment in the Peak Gold JV for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $9.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively.  Pursuant to the terms of the A&R JV LLCA, the Company and KG Mining are required to jointly fund the joint venture operations in proportion to their membership interests in the Peak Gold JV to avoid dilution.  The Company invested $9.3 million in the Peak Gold JV during the current quarter.  The Company invested $0.7 million in the Peak Gold JV during the three months ended December 31, 2021.   The current quarter cash needs of the Peak Gold JV were higher compared to prior year, because the Peak Gold JV moved into the development phase in early 2022, and has been incurring costs related to Manh Choh camp and access roads in preparation for first production in 2024.   The portion of the cumulative loss that exceeds the Company’s cumulative investment will be suspended and recognized against earnings, if any, from the Company’s investment in the Peak Gold JV in future periods. The suspended losses for the period from inception to December 31, 2022 are $14.5 million.
Interest Expense.   On April 26, 2022 ,  the Company closed on a $20,000,000 unsecured convertible debenture to QRC.  The debenture bears interest at 8% per annum, payable quarterly, with 6% paid in cash and 2% paid in shares of Common Stock (See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company acquired AGT in August 2021 for an initial payment at closing of $5 million (plus a working capital adjustment of $0.1 million) in cash and a Promissory Note (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).  Interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 of $0.4 million includes the interest related to the convertible debenture.  Interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 of relates to accrued interest related to the Promissory Note.   The Promissory Note was paid in full with cash on February 25, 2022.
Six Months Ended December 31, 2022
Compared to Six Months Ended December 31, 2021
Claim Rentals Expense.   Claim rental expense primarily consists of State of Alaska rental payments and annual labor payments. We recognized claim rental expense of $273,376 compared to $306,973 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.   The Company relinquished approximately 69,000 acres located on the Eagle/Hona prospect in November 2022.
Exploration Expense.
Exploration expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $6.6 million compared to $2.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021.  Current year exploration expense relates primarily to exploration work performed on our Lucky Shot Property.  Lucky Shot was acquired in August 2021, and the development and exploration program did not begin until late 2021.  Prior year exploration expense also relates to work completed on the Company's Eagle/Hona and Shamrock prospects.
General and Administrative Expense.
General and administrative expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $4.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The Company’s general and administrative expense primarily relates to legal fees, management fees, payroll and stock-based compensation expense. The current year decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to the reduction in stock-based compensation expense.   The stock-based compensation expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $1.6 million, compared to $2.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Loss from Equity Investment in the Peak Gold JV .  The loss from the Company’s equity investment in the Peak Gold JV for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $9.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively.  Pursuant to the terms of the A&R JV LLCA, the Company and KG Mining are required to jointly fund the joint venture operations in proportion to their membership interests in the Peak Gold JV to avoid dilution.  The Company invested $9.3 million in the Peak Gold JV during the six months ended December 31, 2022.  The Company invested $2.2 million in the Peak Gold JV during the six months ended December 31, 2021.   The current quarter cash needs of the Peak Gold JV were higher compared to prior year, because the Peak Gold JV moved into the development phase in early 2022, and has been incurring costs related to Manh Choh camp and access roads in preparation for first production in 2024.  The portion of the cumulative loss that exceeds the Company’s cumulative investment will be suspended and recognized against earnings, if any, from the Company’s investment in the Peak Gold JV in future periods. The suspended losses for the period from inception to December 31, 2022 are $14.5 million.
Interest Expense.   On April 26, 2022 ,  the Company closed on a $20,000,000 unsecured convertible debenture to QRC.  The debenture bears interest at 8% per annum, payable quarterly, with 6% paid in cash and 2% paid in shares of Common Stock (See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).

Insurance Recoveries.   In mid-February 2022 an avalanche occurred at the Lucky Shot Property.  The avalanche destroyed various vehicles and equipment at the site.  During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company received insurance recoveries totaling $0.3 million related to the avalanche.  There were no such recoveries during the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s primary cash requirements have been for general and administrative expenses, capital calls from the Peak Gold JV for the Manh Choh Property, and exploration expenditures on the Lucky Shot Property.  Besides the Kinross Transactions, the Company’s sources of cash have been from Common Stock offerings and the issuance of the $20 million unsecured convertible debenture to Queens Road Capital Investment, Ltd. (“QRC”). In conjunction with the Kinross Transactions, the Company received $32.4 million and 809,744 shares of the Company’s Common Stock.  The 809,744 shares of Common Stock were acquired by KG Mining from Royal Gold, as part of the Royal Gold Transactions and were subsequently canceled by the Company.  Of the $32.4 million cash consideration, $1.2 million constituted a reimbursement prepayment to the Company of its proportionate share of certain silver royalty payments that the Peak Gold JV may be obligated to pay to Royal Gold, with the understanding that KG Mining will bear the entire impact of those royalty payments due from the Peak Gold JV.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $9.0 million of cash.  The Management Committee has approved a budget of $13.6 million for the first calendar quarter of 2023, of which the Company's share is $2.7 million.  To date the Company, has funded $1 million of the approved first calendar quarter budget.  This budget primarily relates to access road construction and refurbishment and expansion of the Manh Choh camp.  On December 23, 2022 the Company completed the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 283,500 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, for $20.00 per share, and warrants  entitling each purchaser to purchase shares of Common Stock for $25.00 per share in a private placement  to certain accredited investors. Net proceeds from the December 2022 Private Placement totaled approximately $5.6 million. (See Note 8 - Stockholder's Equity for further discussion). On January 19, 2023, the Company completed the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 117,500 shares, for $20.00 per share, and warrants  entitling each purchaser to purchase shares of Common Stock for $25.00 per share in a private placement  to certain accredited investors. Net proceeds from the January 2023 Private Placement totaled approximately $2.3 million. The Company will use the proceeds from the December 2022 and January 2023 private placements to fund its exploration and development program and for general corporate purposes.
On April 26, 2022, the Company closed on a $20,000,000 unsecured convertible debenture to QRC. The debenture was purchased at par.  The Company’s cash needs going forward will primarily relate to capital calls from the Peak Gold JV, exploration of the Contango Properties,  and general and administrative expenses of the Company.  If a large budget is undertaken, and no additional financing is obtained, the Company can elect not to fund its portion of the approved budget, in which case the Company would maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital requirements for the next twelve months; however, its membership interest in the Peak Gold JV would be diluted. If the Company's interest in the Peak Gold JV is diluted, the Company may not be able to fully realize its investment in the Peak Gold JV.  Also, if no additional financing is obtained, the Company may not be able to fully realize its investment in the Contango Properties.
25
KG Mining became the Manager of the Peak Gold JV in conjunction with the Kinross Transactions and the signing of the A&R JV LLCA.  Pursuant to the terms of the A&R JV LLCA, the Company and KG Mining are required to jointly fund the joint venture operations in proportion to their membership interests in the Peak Gold JV. If a member elects not to contribute to an approved program and budget or contributes less than its proportionate membership interest, its percentage membership interest will be reduced. The Company’s ability to contribute funds sufficient to retain its membership interests in the Peak Gold JV may be limited. To date, neither the Company nor the Peak Gold JV has generated any revenue from mineral sales or operations. In the future, the Peak Gold JV may generate revenue from a combination of mineral sales and other payments resulting from any commercially recoverable minerals from the Peak Gold JV Property. The Company currently does not have any recurring source of revenue. The Peak Gold JV currently does not  have any recurring source of revenue, and its only source of cash inflows are contributions received from KG Mining and the Company.  As a result, the Company’s ability to contribute funds to the Peak Gold JV and retain its membership interest will depend on its ability to raise capital. The Company has limited financial resources and the ability of the Company to arrange additional financing in the future will depend, in part, on the prevailing capital market conditions, the exploration results achieved at the Peak Gold JV Property, as well as the market price of metals. The Company cannot be certain that financing will be available to the Company on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company were unable to fund its contributions to the approved programs and budgets for the Peak Gold JV, its membership interest in the Peak Gold JV would be diluted.
Further financing by the Company may include issuances of equity, instruments convertible into equity (such as warrants) or various forms of debt. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and or debt securities in the next six months for purposes of funding its proportionate share of future Peak Gold JV exploration and for the Company’s operating costs. The Company has issued Common Stock and other instruments convertible into equity in the past and cannot predict the size or price of any future issuances of Common Stock or other instruments convertible into equity, and the effect, if any, that such future issuances and sales will have on the market price of the Company’s securities. Any additional issuances of Common Stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock may ultimately result in dilution to the holders of Common Stock, dilution in any future earnings per share of the Company and may have a material adverse effect upon the market price of the Common Stock of the Company.
