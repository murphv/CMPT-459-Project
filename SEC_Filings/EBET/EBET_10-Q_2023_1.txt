CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other
than statements of historical fact, contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future
operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking
statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,”
“project,” “should,” “target,” “would,” and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.
The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include,
but are not limited to those described under the “Risk Factors” section and include, among other things:
·
our ability to successfully integrate our asset acquisitions;
·
our ability to introduce new enhancements to our website on the timeline we have indicated;
·
our ability to obtain additional funding to develop additional services and offerings and to service our debt obligations;
·
our ability to achieve and maintain compliance with the covenants in our debt obligations or to obtain
additional waivers until we are able to do so;
·
compliance with obligations under intellectual property licenses with third parties;
·
market acceptance of our new offerings;
·
competition from existing online offerings or new offerings that may emerge;
·
our ability to establish or maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;
·
our ability and third parties’ abilities to protect intellectual property rights;
·
our ability to adequately support future growth; and
·
our ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively.
We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed
in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events
could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. In addition,
statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements
are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information
forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to
indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information.
We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in the “Risk Factors” section, that we believe could cause actual results
or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time
to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect
the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, collaborations, joint ventures or investments we may make or enter
into.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 –
ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF OPERATIONS
AND GOING CONCERN
Organization
EBET, Inc. (“EBET” or “the Company”)
was formed on September 24, 2020 as a Nevada corporation. EBET is a technology company operating platforms focused on igaming including
casino, sportsbook and esports events. The Company operates under a Curacao gaming sublicense and under a strategic partnership with Aspire
Global plc (“Aspire”) allowing EBET to provide online betting services to various countries around the world.
Acquisition of the B2C business of Aspire Global
plc
On October 1, 2021, the Company, and Esports Product
Technologies Malta Ltd. (“Esports Malta”) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”)
with Aspire and various Aspire group companies to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Karamba Limited. The total acquisition
price was € 65,000,000
paid as follows: (i) cash amount of € 50,000,000 ; (ii) € 10,000,000 , payable in accordance with the
terms of an unsecured subordinated promissory note (the “Note”); and (iii) shares of Company common stock, which are valued
at € 5,000,000
(based on the weighted-average per-share price of the ten days prior to the execution date of the Acquisition Agreement
(the “Exchange Shares”). See Notes 3, 4 and 5 for additional information.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent
upon the ability of the Company to obtain equity or debt financings to continue operations. The Company has a history of and expects to
continue to report negative cash flows from operations and a net loss. The Company's forecasts for 2023 and beyond indicate that
it we will need additional funding in order to have sufficient financial resources to continue to settle its debts as they fall due. The
Company has taken significant measures to increase the profitability of its business in the short term. These actions include optimizing
the efficiency of marketing campaigns, reducing the total number of employees and contractors, terminating software and other immaterial
contracts as well as generally reducing the operating costs of the business. These efforts have also resulted in an increased focus on
the Company’s i-gaming business and a significant reduction in the investment of the Company’s esports products and technologies,
which resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss on certain intangible assets and fixed assets. As a result of the Company’s
actions as referenced above, it does not expect to launch its esports products in the short or medium term. These factors raise substantial
doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt
financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations,
strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash outlays or a combination thereof. Management cannot be certain that
such events or a combination thereof can be achieved.
Impact of COVID-19
The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease
(“COVID-19”), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the related responses
by public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat its outbreak and spread, has severely impacted the U.S. and world
economies. Economic recessions, including those brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak may have a negative effect on the demand for the Company’s
products and the Company’s operating results. The range of possible impacts on the Company’s business from the coronavirus
pandemic could include: (i) changing demand for the Company’s online betting products; and (ii) increasing contraction in the capital
markets.
8
A significant or prolonged decrease in consumer
spending on entertainment or leisure activities would also likely have an adverse effect on demand for the Company’s products, reducing
cash flows and revenues, and thereby materially harming the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, a materially disruptive resurgence of COVID-19 cases or the emergence of additional variants or strains of COVID-19 could cause
other widespread or more severe impacts depending on where infection rates are highest. As steps taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19
necessitated a shift away from a traditional office environment for many employees, the Company implemented business continuity programs
to ensure that employees were safe and that the business continued to function with minimal disruptions to normal work operations while
employees worked remotely. The Company will continue to monitor developments relating to disruptions and uncertainties caused by COVID-19.
NOTE 2 –
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
The significant accounting policies followed in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements of
the Company, include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim unaudited financial information. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
The unaudited financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary in order to make the condensed financial statements not misleading. Operating results for the three months ended December 31,
2022, are not necessarily indicative of the final results that may be expected for the year ended September 30, 2023. For more complete
financial information, these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
for the year ended September 30, 2022 included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which
would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal period,
as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted. All intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
period amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivables are recorded at amortized cost, less any allowance
for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from our platform provider. The receivable balance as of
September 30, 2022 owed to the Company represents the net amount owed to the Company by Aspire related to the strategic agreement for
the Company’s i-gaming platform and is stated at historical cost less any allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful
accounts was $ 0  as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Intangible Assets
The Company’s intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships,
trademarks and internet domain names. Certain intangible assets have a defined useful life and others are classified as indefinite-lived
intangible assets. Other intangible assets with a defined useful life are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives on a straight-line
basis. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when
events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment
exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is more likely than
not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to
perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the
asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.
9
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets consist of software and equipment,
finite-lived acquired intangible assets, such as license agreements, and indefinite-lived assets such as internet domain names. Long-lived
assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
may not be fully recoverable. Impairment expense is recognized to the extent an asset’s expected undiscounted future cash flows
are less than the asset’s carrying amount.
Leases
The Company accounts for leases under ASC
842. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease on its execution date. If the contract contains a lease, lease
classification is assessed upon its commencement date under ASC 842. For leases that are determined to qualify for treatment as
operating leases, rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases that are determined to qualify for
treatment as finance leases recognize interest expense as determined using the effective interest method with corresponding
amortization of the right-of-use assets. For leases with terms of 12 months and greater, an asset and liability are initially
recorded at an amount equal to the present value of the unpaid lease payments over the lease term. In determining the lease term for
each lease, the Company includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.
The Company uses the interest rate implicit in the lease, when known, or its estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived
from information available at the lease commencement date including prevailing financial market conditions, in determining the
present value of the unpaid lease payments.
The Company’s
only significant lease is for office space in Malta, which has a two-year lease term beginning August 1, 2021, and is classified as
an operating lease. The lease has an option to extend the term for an additional two years with a 10% increase in annual rent. The
Company paid €176,001 at commencement and owed an additional €160,001 in August 2022. The Company has been making
monthly payments of € 13,335
on this annual payment. The Company recognized a right of use asset and lease liability of $ 381,346
at commencement based on the present value of lease payments at commencement and utilizing an estimate incremental borrowing rate
of  10 %.
The following table summarizes the lease-related
assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022:

10
Liabilities to Users
The Company records liabilities for user account balances
at a given reporting period based on deposits made by players either to the Company or the sales affiliate, less any losses on wagers
and payout made to players. Liabilities to users amounts are not required to be backed by cash reserves of the Company. The user balances
are maintained by the Company’s third-party platform provider, and the Company has an asset of an equivalent amount included within  Prepaid
expense and other current assets  on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
ASC Topic 606,
Revenue From Contracts With Customers , which requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized based on the following five step model:
·
Identification of the contract with a customer
·
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
·
Determination of the transaction price
·
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
·
Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. In addition, no disaggregation of revenue is required because all current revenue is generated
from gaming revenue.
i-gaming, or online casino, typically includes
digital versions of wagering games available in land-based casinos, such as blackjack, roulette and slot machines. For these offerings,
the Company functions similarly to land-based casinos, generating revenue through casino hold, as users play against the house. i-gaming
revenue is generated from user wagers net of payouts made on users’ winning wagers and incentives awarded to users.
Sportsbook or sports betting involves a user wagering
money on an outcome or series of outcomes occurring. When a user’s wager wins, the Company pays the user a pre-determined amount
known as fixed odds. Sportsbook revenue is generated by setting odds such that there is a built-in theoretical margin in each sports wagering
opportunity offered to users. Sportsbook revenue is generated from users’ wagers net of payouts made on users’ winning wagers
and incentives awarded to users.
Performance Obligations
The Company operates an online betting platform allowing users to place
wagers on a variety of live sporting events, i-gaming and esports events. Each wager placed by users create a single performance obligation
for the Company to administer each event wagered. The performance obligation is satisfied once the event wagered on has been completed.
Gross gaming revenue is the aggregate of gaming wins and losses based on results of each event that customers wager bets on.
11
Transaction Price Considerations
Variability in the transaction price arises primarily
due to market-based pricing, cash discounts, revenue sharing and usage-based fees. The Company offers loyalty programs, free plays, deposit
bonuses, discounts, rebates and other rewards and incentives to its customers. Revenue for Sportsbook and i-gaming is collected prior
to the contest or event and is fixed once the outcome is known. Prizes paid and payouts made to users are recognized when awarded to the
player.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of third-party costs associated
with the betting software platform and gaming taxes.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
expenses associated with amounts paid to affiliates, advertising and related software, strategic league and team partnerships and costs
related to free to play contests, and the compensation of sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expenses.
Variable commission fees are paid to sales affiliates based on a percentage of revenue generated from the affiliate. The commissions rebated
to affiliates are recorded as a component of marketing expense. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs incurred
was $ 3,737,017
and $ 2,721,899
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Product and Technology Expenses
Product and technology expenses consist primarily
of expenses which are not subject to capitalization or otherwise classified within Cost of Revenue. Product and Technology expenses include
software licenses, depreciation of hardware and software and costs related to the compensation of product and technology personnel, including
stock-based compensation.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include costs
related to the compensation of the Company’s administrative functions, insurance costs, professional fees and consulting expense.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company discloses fair value measurements for
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Fair value is based on the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1
inputs.
Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs
not quoted on active markets but are corroborated by market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little
or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.
12
The following tables set forth the fair value of the Company’s
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 based on the three-tier fair value
hierarchy:

Derivative Instruments
The Company accounts for its derivative financial
instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging  (“ASC 815”) and ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”) .
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure
to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes
in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (a component
of Total shareholders' equity), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative
is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows
at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items.
The Company's derivative instruments do not
subject its earnings or cash flows to material risk, as gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset losses and gains
on the item being hedged. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and it does not have any non-derivative
instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. The Company manages the credit risk of its counterparties
by dealing only with institutions that it considers financially sound and considers the risk of non-performance to be remote.
13
The Company entered into foreign exchange forward
contracts to mitigate the change in fair value of specific liabilities and cash flows on the Consolidated Balance Sheets that were denominated
in Euros related to the acquisition of the Aspire B2C business in November 2021. These undesignated hedging instruments are recorded at
fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized
in Other income (expense), net. The cash flows related to the gains and losses are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows
as part of cash flows from operating activities. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $ 16,050,000
as of September 30, 2022. The Company recognized a gain on derivative instruments of $ 1,239,510
during the year ended September 30, 2022.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled all of its foreign exchange forward contracts, receiving cash proceeds
of $ 973,965
and recognized a loss of $ 142,187 .
Foreign Currency
The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S.
Dollar. Certain subsidiaries of the Company have a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, and are translated to the Company’s
reporting currency at each reporting date. Non-monetary items are translated at historical rates. Monetary assets and liabilities are
translated from British pounds and Euro into U.S. Dollars, at the period-end exchange rate, while foreign currency expenses are translated
at the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. The net effect of translation is reflected as other comprehensive income.
The gains or losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are included in the consolidated
statement of operations.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company uses
qualitative and if necessary, quantitative methods in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350,
Goodwill . The Company also considers
its enterprise value and if necessary, discounted cash flow model, which involves assumptions and estimates, including the Company’s
future financial performance, weighted average cost of capital and interpretation of currently enacted tax laws.
Circumstances that could indicate impairment and require
the Company to perform a quantitative impairment test include a significant decline in the Company’s financial results, a significant
decline in the Company’s enterprise value relative to its book value, an unanticipated change in competition of the Company’s
market share and a significant change in the Company’s strategic plans.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are
issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that the Company adopts as of
the specified effective date. The Company does not believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will
have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

Senior Notes
On November 29, 2021, the Company entered into a credit
agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with CP BF Lending, LLC (“Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender agreed to
make a single loan to the Company of $ 30,000,000
(the “Loan”). The Loan bears interest on the unpaid principal amount at a
rate per annum equal to 15.0% as follows: (1) cash interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Loan at a rate equal to 14.0% per annum,
plus (2) payable-in-kind interest (“PIK Interest”) on the unpaid principal amount of the Loan at a rate equal to 1.0% per
annum. The Company paid to Lender on the closing date a non-refundable origination fee in an amount equal to $ 750,000 .
The Senior Note matures in 36 months, provided that
the Company may receive two 12-month extensions of the maturity date by paying to the Lender (1) an extension fee equal to 1.0% of the
unpaid principal balance of the Loan as of the date of such extension, and (2) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
paid or incurred by Lender, in each case in connection with the extension request, including but not limited to fees and expenses for
appraisals, collateral exams and audits, and legal counsel. The foregoing extension right is subject to, among other items, (i) the Loan
not being in default, (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Credit Agreement being true and correct; and (iii) the Lender
granting its written approval thereof in its sole discretion.
The Senior Note may be prepaid by the Company
at any time. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides that in the event there shall be excess cash flow from the Aspire Business (as
such concept is defined in the Credit Agreement) for any calendar month, commencing with the month ended December 31, 2022, the Company
shall apply a portion of such excess cash flow amount to prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Loan; provided that no such prepayment
shall be required once the unpaid principal balance of the Loan has been reduced to $15,000,000.
The Credit Agreement requires the Company to meet
certain financial covenants commencing June 30, 2022. The Loan is secured by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
Loan may be accelerated by the Lender upon an event of default, which in addition to customary events of default include: (i) if (1) any
of the Company or its subsidiaries shall fail to maintain in full force and effect any gaming approval (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
required for the operation of its business or (2) any gaming regulator shall impose any condition or limitation on any of the foregoing
entities that could be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect; or (ii) the suspension from trading or failure of the Company’s
common stock to be trading or listed on the Nasdaq exchange for a period of three consecutive trading days.
As of March 31, 2022, the Company had not maintained
compliance with the covenants of the Senior Notes and obtained a waiver from its lender which waiver is contingent on the completion of
an equity raise of $3.5 million, which was completed in June 2022. In consideration for obtaining a waiver from the compliance with certain
covenants, the Company agreed to amend the Senior Notes such that $5 million of principal loan balance becomes convertible at $3.58 per
share commencing after the Company raises the $5,000,000 of common equity (including the foregoing $3.5 million).
In connection with the Loan, the Company issued the
Lender a warrant (the “Lender Warrant”) to purchase
1,567,840
shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $25.00
per share expiring on the earlier to occur of (i) five years following the issue date or (ii) the second anniversary of the satisfaction
of all obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement. The exercise price is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of
certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the Company’s
common stock. In addition, the exercise price of the Lender Warrant is subject to “weighted-average” anti-dilution protection
for issuances by the Company below the exercise price (other than certain defined exempt issuances), and, upon shareholder approval, which
was received on February 9, 2022, the number of shares underlying the Lender Warrant shall also be adjusted for issuances to which the
“weighted-average” anti-dilution protection applies. Pursuant to the foregoing anti-dilution provision, in connection with
the $ 3.5
million
offering completed in June 2022, the number of shares underlying the warrant increased to
1,654,538
and the exercise
price was reduced to $ 23.69 . The Lender will not have the right to exercise any portion of the Lender Warrant if the Lender (together
with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of Company common stock outstanding immediately
after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Lender Warrant, which
beneficial ownership amount, at the election of the Lender may be increased to any other percentage not in excess of 19.99% as specified
by the Lender. If a fundamental transaction occurs, then the successor entity will succeed to, and be substituted for the Company, and
will assume all of the Company’s obligations under the Lender Warrant with the same effect as if such successor entity had been
named in the Lender Warrant itself.
16
On September 2, 2022, the Lender provided the Company with a limited
waiver of these covenants until September 30, 2022 in exchange for a one-time payment of $ 151,158
to be added to the principal amount
of the Senior Note. In addition, the Senior Note required the Company to maintain a minimum balance of $4.0 million in the account utilized
to collect the revenues from the Company’s i-gaming business. On September 30, 2022, the Lender provided the Company with a limited
waiver of these covenants until October 31, 2022 in exchange for a one-time payment of $ 152,032
to be added to the principal amount of
the Senior Note. In addition, the Senior Note required the Company to maintain a minimum balance of $5.0 million in the account utilized
to collect the revenues from the Company’s i-gaming business.
On October 6, 2022, the Lender provided the Company with an additional
limited waiver allowing the foregoing minimum balance to be reduced to $4.0 million until October 31, 2022, in exchange for a one-time
payment of $ 76,409
to be added to the principal amount of the Senior Note. On October 31, 2022, the Lender provided the Company with a
limited waiver of these covenants until November 30, 2022 in exchange for a one-time payment of $ 229,959
to be added to the principal
amount of the Senior Note. On November 30, 2022, the Lender provided the Company with a limited waiver of these covenants until December
16, 2022. On December 16, 2022, the Lender provided the Company with a limited waiver of these covenants until January 9, 2023.
On January 9, 2023, the Lender provided the Company with a limited
waiver of these covenants until January 31, 2023 and required a principal payment of $ 3,000,000
which was made on January 10, 2023. This
waiver and principal payment reduced the minimum balance in the account to $ 1,500,000 . On January 31, 2023, the Lender provided the Company
with a limited waiver of these covenants until February 17, 2023. On February 1, 2023, the Lender provided the Company with a further
limited waiver of these covenants until April 28, 2023. The Company does not expect to satisfy certain of these covenants prior to April
28, 2023 and is currently in discussions with the Lender on modifying the financial covenants, although there is no assurance that the
Company will be successful in making such modifications to the Senior Note.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
Company recognized interest expense of $ 1,264,933
and $ 207,389 , respectively, from the amortization debt discount and debt issuance
costs related to the Senior Note.
Note due to Aspire
The Note provides for an interest rate of 10% per
annum. The maturity date of the Note will be the earlier of that date which is four years from the issuance date or a liquidity event.
The Note will require repayment of the principal amount plus any accrued interest in three equal installments, payable annually starting
on the second anniversary after issuance. No interest payment shall be due until that date which is the last day of the end of the second-year
anniversary of issuance should the Note remain unpaid at such time. Should the Note remain unpaid at the second-year anniversary, the
total accrued interest due at that time shall be paid at the second year anniversary for accrued interest for the period from the issuance
date through the second year anniversary date. Thereafter, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter, the interest due for the prior
annual period shall be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company owes greater than $15,000,000 under the Credit Agreement, then
the parties agree that the Company shall repay any principal amount plus any accrued interest due through the issuance of Company common
stock in lieu of any cash payment and the amount of said common stock shares to be issued by the Company shall be determined by using
the Conversion Price as defined below. Should an event of default occur on the Note, then at the election of Aspire, either (i) the Operator
Services Agreement will be amended such that the fees payable shall increase by 5% during the continuation of the event of default, or
(ii) Aspire may elect to convert the entire outstanding principal amount plus any accrued interest into shares of common stock of the
Company at a price per share based on the weighted-average per-share price for the ten trading days prior to the date of the occurrence
of the event of default (“Conversion Price”). In no event shall the Conversion Price be lower than $18.00 per share (as adjusted
for stock splits, stock dividends, or similar events occurring after the date hereof) and the total maximum number of shares of common
stock that may be issued to Aspire upon any such conversion in the aggregate shall be 650,000 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, or similar events occurring after the date hereof).
17
Convertible Notes and other
On September 1, 2020, ESEG entered into three promissory
notes, with a combined principal amount of $ 2,100,000 . The notes bore interest at the rate of
10 % per annum and matured on
March 1, 2022
and are now convertible at the noteholder’s option. The Company also agreed to pay two of the lenders a total of $ 675,000
on September
1, 2025, bearing no interest. The Company issued each of the lenders a conversion option at a fixed price of $0.50 per share and issued
2,015,000
warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share, each with a term of
five years. The convertible notes bear interest at 10% per annum and matured on March 1, 2022. The holder may convert the note into shares
of common stock at any time throughout the maturity date, to the extent and provided that no holder of the notes was or will be permitted
to convert such notes so long as it or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the Company’s common stock
after such conversion.
The Company evaluated the conversion option and concluded
a beneficial conversion feature was present at issuance. The Company recognized the beneficial conversion feature and relative fair value
of the warrants as a debt discount and additional paid in capital. The fair value of the warrants at the grant date was estimated using
a Black-Scholes model and the following assumptions: 1) volatility of approximately 85% based on a peer group of companies; 2) dividend
yield of 0%; 3) risk-free rate of 0.26%; and 4) an expected term of five years. The $ 2,100,000
debt discount will be amortized through
the maturity date of the convertible notes payable. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, a total of $ 187,500
of principal
was converted into
375,000
shares of common stock. During the year ended September 30, 2022, a total of $ 305,609
of principal and $ 106,891
of accrued interest was converted into
825,000
shares of common stock. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, a total of $ 300,000
of principal was converted into
600,000
shares of common stock.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, the Company recorded a charge of $ 12,083
and $ 320,823 , respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations from
the amortization of its debt discount related to the convertible notes payable and other liabilities described above.

Acquisition of the B2C segment of Aspire Global
plc
On October 1, 2021, in connection with the Acquisition,
the Company entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “Investors”).
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and the Company agreed to issue and sell
to such Investors, simultaneous with the closing of the Acquisition Agreement, an aggregate of
37,700
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) for a purchase price of $ 1,000.00
per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 37,700,000
(the
“Private Placement”). For each share of Preferred Stock issued, the Company issued the Investor a warrant to purchase 150%
of the shares of Company common stock underlying the Preferred Stock (the “Warrants”).
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Company
has obtained shareholder approval of the conversion of the Preferred Stock and Warrants into Company common stock in compliance with the
rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Shareholder Approval”).
18
The Preferred Stockholders are entitled to receive
dividends, at a rate of 14.0% per annum, which shall be payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, beginning
on the first such date after the issuance date. With limited exceptions, the Preferred Stockholders will have no voting rights. The dividends
can be paid in either cash or in the issuance of additional preferred shares. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company,
the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets, whether capital or surplus, of the Company available
to shareholders, an amount equal to the greater of: (i) the purchase price for each share of Preferred Stock then held, or (ii) the amount
the holders would have received had the holders fully converted the Preferred Stock to Company common stock, in each case, before any
distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of the Company’s common stock. The Preferred Stock is convertible into Company
common stock at an initial conversion price of $28.00 per share (“Conversion Price”); provided that the Conversion Price is
subject to anti-dilution protection upon any subsequent transaction at a price lower than the Conversion Price then in effect. In addition,
on April 28, 2023, July 31, 2023, and October 31, 2023 (each an “Adjustment Date”), the Conversion Price was to be adjusted
to the lesser of: (i) the Conversion Price in effect on the Adjustment Date, or (ii) 85% of the average closing price of the Company’s
common stock for the fifteen trading days prior to the Adjustment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjusted Conversion Price may
not be less than $0.71, unless the terms of the new adjustment dates are approved by our shareholders, as required pursuant to applicable
rules and regulations of NASDAQ.
The Warrants are exercisable and expire on the fifth
anniversary thereafter. The Warrants were initially to be exercisable at an exercise price of $30.00 per share, provided that the exercise
price is subject to anti-dilution protection upon any subsequent transaction at a price lower than the exercise price then in effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing anti-dilution provision, in connection with the $3.5 million offering completed in June 2022, the exercise
price was reduced to $5.00. The Warrants can be exercised on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement registering,
or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the ordinary shares underlying the Warrants.
The holders of the Preferred Stock and Warrants will
not have the right to convert or exercise any portion of the Preferred Stock and Warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such
conversion, such holder (together with certain related parties) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the Company’s common
stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or exercise.
Warrants

stock warrants in connection with its fundraising activities to preference shareholders, its lender and convertible notes issued during

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Financial Advisor’s Claims
The Company’s previous financial advisor,
Boustead Securities LLC (“Advisor”) has alleged a breach by the Company over the termination of their engagement and the timing
of the payment and amount of the fees owed to the Advisor among other claims (collectively the “Claims”). The fees the Company
expects to pay are accrued in the accompanying balance sheet. On June 2, 2022, the Advisor named EBET in an arbitration proceeding with
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) in connection with the Claims. The statement of claim alleges damages of
$ 5.7
million
and seeks a declaration that the Company be required to utilize the Advisor for a certain follow-on offering pursuant to
an alleged right of first refusal between the parties. On August 4, 2022, EBET, Inc. counterclaimed against Boustead Securities, LLC for
tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and demanded damages and attorneys’ fees in an amount to be determined.
The case is ongoing, with a hearing before a 3-arbitrator panel currently scheduled for July 2023. Arbitration is inherently unpredictable.
However, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to a portion of the alleged fee claim asserted and to the claim that the
Company has any obligations pursuant to a right of first refusal between the parties. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations
could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of this matter. At this time, any estimated loss potentially arising
from the Claims cannot be reasonably estimated and no liability has been recognized.
NOTE 8 –
LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
The basic net loss per common share is calculated
by dividing the Company's net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The
diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the basic
weighted number of common shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Common shares issuable under convertible debt,
stock options and common stock warrants were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share due to their antidilutive effect.

NOTE 10
– SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS
On February 2, 2023 the Company
entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”) with several institutional and accredited investors
to issue, in an offering (the “February Offering”): (i) 6,372,530 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and (ii) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,372,530
shares of Common Stock (the “Warrants”). The combined purchase price of one share of Common Stock and accompanying Warrant
is $1.02. The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering are expected to be approximately $6.5 million, before deducting fees and
other offering expenses, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Warrants. The Company intends to use the net proceeds
for general corporate purposes.
Subject to certain ownership
limitations, the Warrants are exercisable commencing six months after issuance. Each Warrant is exercisable into one share of Common Stock
at a price per share of $1.02 (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof) and will expire  five
and one-half years from the issuance date . The closing of the sales of these securities under the Purchase Agreements was on February
6, 2023.
On February 2, 2022, the
Company entered into a Placement Agent Agreement (the “Placement Agent Agreement”) with WestPark Capital, Inc. (the “WestPark”),
pursuant to which the Company has agreed to pay WestPark an aggregate fee equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds received by the Company
from the sale of the securities in the transaction. In addition, the Company agreed to pay to WestPark on the Closing Date a cash fee
equal to 1.0% of gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the securities in the transaction for non-accountable expenses.
The Company will also pay WestPark up to $50,000 of fees and other expenses.
In connection with the offering described above,
the exercise price of a total of 2,019,672 warrants issued in connection with the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
and a total of 977,659 warrants issued in connection with the June 2022 Private Placement were adjusted to $1.02 per share. No adjustments
will be made to the number of shares underlying the Warrants. Additionally, the exercise price of the Lender Warrant issued in connection
with the Senior notes was reset to $16.95 and the number of shares underlying the Lender Warrant became 2,312,449, and $5,000,000 of the
principal balance of the Senior Note became convertible at $3.58 per share.
Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company issued
6,250 shares of common stock pursuant to restricted stock unit exercises. Additionally, on February 6, 2023 two holders of the convertible
notes converted a total of $625,000 in principal and $107,661 of accrued interest into 1,465,322 shares of common stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section of this report includes forward-looking statements that
reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are often identified by
words like, believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions or words which, by their nature, refer to future
events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. These
forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
results or our predictions.
Overview
We operate platforms to provide
a real money online gambling experience focused on i-gaming including casino, sportsbook and esports events. The Company operates under
a Curacao gaming sublicense and under a strategic partnership with Aspire Global plc (“Aspire”) allowing EBET to provide online
betting services to various countries around the world.
Acquisition of Aspire Global Plc’s (“Aspire”)
Business to Consumer (“B2C”) Business
In order to accelerate the growth and expand
market access for our esports product offerings, on November 29, 2021, we acquired Aspire’s B2C Business, for €65,000,000 payable
as follows: (i) a cash amount of €50,000,000; (ii) €10,000,000, payable in accordance with the terms of an unsecured subordinated
promissory note; and (iii) 186,838 shares of our common stock, which were valued at €5,000,000.
The acquisition of Aspire’s B2C business
provides the following strategic benefits:
·
ownership of Aspire’s portfolio of B2C proprietary online casino and sportsbook brands consisting of Karamba, Hopa, Griffon Casino, BetTarget, Dansk777, and GenerationVIP;
·
market access for our esports products in key regulated markets including the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Malta, and Denmark, among others, allowing us to cross-sell esports wagering opportunities;
·
enhanced strategic partnership with Aspire who provides the on-line gaming platform and a managed services offering, including customer service, customer on-boarding and payment processing ensuring operational stability and continuity.
Our gaming sub-license from the Curacao Gaming
Authority and the licenses made available to us from the acquisition of the Aspire B2C business allows us to accept esports and sports
wagers from residents of more than 160 jurisdictions.
Focus on I-Gaming Operations
During the quarter ending September 30, 2022,
we took significant measures to increase the profitability of our business in the short term. These actions include optimizing the efficiency
of marketing campaigns, reducing the total number of employees and contractors by approximately 45 positions, terminating software and
other immaterial contracts as well as generally reducing the operating costs of the business. While these efforts focus on the goal of
attaining profitability of our business, it is likely to reduce overall revenue growth in the short to medium term. In addition, even
after these efforts, we are not currently generating sufficient cash from our operations to settle our debts as they fall due and continue
to require near term financing to fund our operations and continue our business. These efforts have also resulted in an increased focus
on our i-gaming business and the halting of investment in the Company’s esports products and technologies. As a result of these
actions as referenced above, we do not expect to launch our esports products in the foreseeable future.

Revenue
For the three months ended December 31,
2022, we generated $14,407,964 in revenue compared to $7,139,927 in revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase
in revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2022, when compared with the same period in the prior year, was driven by the full quarter
of operations from the acquisition of the Aspire B2C business in November 2021 which continues to generate significant revenue in the
UK, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Austria and other regulated markets, and accounted for all of the increase in revenue for the three months
ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result of the Company’s restructuring of the business
to improve its immediate profitability, certain inefficient sales and marketing efforts will be curtailed, which may adversely impact
revenue growth in the short to medium term.
25
Cost of Revenue
During the three
months ended December 31, 2022, cost of sales was $8,518,622 as compared with $4,609,087 in the same period in the prior year. The increase
in cost of sales is due entirely to a full quarter of operations from the acquisition of the Aspire B2C business in November 2021 and
is consistent with the increase in revenue and consists of third-party costs associated with the betting software platform and gaming
taxes.
Sales and Marketing Expense
Sales and marketing expense was $4,367,395
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $3,974,784 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $392,611.
The increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily driven by two additional months of operations from the acquisition of the Aspire
B2C business. Sales and marketing expenses also included $225,564 and $877,759 of stock-based compensation costs to employees and consultants
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, payroll costs of $373,094 and $461,893, respectively, for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as our marketing
campaigns increase in both number and volume.
Product and Technology Expense
Product and technology expense
was $294,073 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,015,248 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease
of $721,175. The decrease is due to decreased spending related to development of the esports operations that were abandoned in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2022. Product and technology expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, included payroll-related costs of
$166,932, stock-based compensation of $43,571 and other development costs of $83,570 consisting primarily of consulting and other development
costs. Product and technology expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2021, included payroll-related costs of $568,159, stock-based
compensation of $328,951 and other development costs of $118,138 consisting primarily of consulting and other development costs.
Acquisition Costs
Acquisition costs
were $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $2,238,957 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Acquisition
costs in the comparable period included a non-cash hedging loss of $1,570,000 from executing a forward contract on the purchase price
of the acquisition of the Aspire B2C business to hedge exposure to fluctuations in the Euro. Acquisition costs also included various legal
and consultant fees associated with completing the acquisition.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative
expense was $3,382,793 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $3,144,420 for the same period in the prior year.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 included amortization of intangible assets of $1,623,448,
payroll-related costs of $523,633, stock-based compensation cost of $225,564, and professional fees of $150,736 including legal, accounting,
investor relations and other professional fees, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. General and administrative expense
for the three months ended December 31, 2021 included payroll-related costs of $461,894, stock-based compensation cost of $877,759 (of
which $573,750 was to outside consultants) and professional fees of $799,160. The increase in payroll is due to a full quarter of Aspire
B2C business related payroll costs.
Interest and Other Expenses
During the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized interest expense of $3,031,348 and $976,418, respectively, which included amortization of debt discounts
and deferred finance costs of $1,277,016 and $528,212 related to the Senior Notes issued to acquire the Aspire business, and convertible
debt issued to acquire certain intangible assets in the previous year. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 we also incurred
a foreign currency loss of $2,229,311 due to fluctuations in the Euro compared to the US dollar.
26
Net Income/Loss
Net loss for the three months ended December
31, 2022, was $7,548,137 compared to a net loss of $8,881,038 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net loss was primarily
due to the increased revenue and gross profit from a full quarter of operations with the Aspire B2C business in the current period, and
decreased operating expenses from the lack of acquisition costs in the current period, partially offset by the increase in interest expense
as described above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $5,825,984, and had a working capital deficit of $28,856,810. We have historically funded our operations from proceeds from debt and
equity sales, and funds received from customers. Our forecasts for fiscal year 2023 indicate that we will need near term additional funding
in order to have sufficient financial resources to satisfy our outstanding debts and to continue to settle our debts as they fall due.
On February 6, 2023, we sold 6,372,530 shares of common stock and an equal number of warrants for gross proceeds of approximately $6,500,000.
We do not have any commitments for additional funding and there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional financing on
favorable terms, if at all.
The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to obtain equity or debt financings to continue operations. We have a history of and expect to continue to report negative
cash flows from operations and a net loss.  Our forecasts for 2023 and beyond indicate that we will need additional funding in order
to have sufficient financial resources to continue to settle our debts as they fall due. We have taken significant measures to increase
the profitability of our business in the short term, but we are not currently generating sufficient cash from our operations to settle
our debts as they fall due and continue to require near term financing. These actions include optimizing the efficiency of marketing
campaigns, reducing the total number of employees and contractors, terminating software and other immaterial contracts as well as generally
reducing the operating costs of the business. These efforts have also resulted in an increased focus on our i-gaming business and a significant
reduction in the investment of our esports products and technologies, which resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss on certain
intangible assets and fixed assets. As a result of our actions as referenced above, we do not expect to launch our esports products in
the short or medium term. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. We may seek additional funding through a combination of equity
offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other
collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash outlays or a combination thereof. Management cannot
be certain that such events or a combination thereof can be achieved.
In order to accelerate the growth, on November
29, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Aspire Global’s B2C business for €65,000,000 payable as follows: (i) a cash amount
of €50,000,000; (ii) €10,000,000, payable in accordance with the terms of an unsecured subordinated promissory note; and (iii)
186,838 shares of our common stock, which were valued at €5,000,000.
On September 30, 2021, we entered into subscription
agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “Investors”). Pursuant to the Subscription
Agreements, the Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and we agreed to issue and sell to such Investors, simultaneous with the
closing of the Acquisition Agreement, shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) for a purchase
price of $1,000.00 per share (the “Private Placement”). For each share of Preferred Stock issued, we issued the Investor a
warrant to purchase 150% of the shares of common stock underlying the Preferred Stock (the “Warrants”). The aggregate Private
Placement, which was completed on the closing date of the Acquisition Agreement was $37,700,000.
27
On November 29, 2021, we entered
a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with CP BF Lending, LLC (“Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender agreed
to make a single loan to us of $30.0 million (the “ Senior Note ”). The
Senior
Note
bears interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum equal to 15.0% as follows: (1) cash interest on the unpaid
principal amount of the
Senior Note
at a rate equal to 14.0% per annum, plus (2) payable-in-kind
interest (“PIK Interest”) on the unpaid principal amount of the
Senior Note
at
a rate equal to 1.0% per annum. We paid to Lender on the closing date a non-refundable origination fee in an amount equal to $750,000.
To date, we have entered into multiple waiver agreements with the Lender to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants
pursuant to the Credit Agreement. On January 10, 2023, the Company repaid $3,000,000 on the Senior Notes pursuant to the most recent waiver
agreement with the Lender, which in turn reduced the minimum cash balance requirement under the Senior Notes to $1,500,000. On January
31, 2023, the Lender provided the Company with a limited waiver of these covenants until February 17, 2023. On February 1, 2023, the Lender
provided the Company with a further limited waiver of these covenants until April 28, 2023. The Company does not expect to satisfy certain
of these covenants prior to April 28, 2023 and is currently in discussions with the Lender on modifying the financial covenants, although
there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in making such modifications to the Senior Note.
On June 16, 2022, we
issued, in a private placement priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules: (i) 977,657 shares of common stock, and (ii) warrants to
purchase up to an aggregate of 977,657 shares of common stock. The combined purchase price of one share of common stock and accompanying
warrant is $3.58. The gross proceeds to us from the private placement were approximately $3.5 million, before deducting fees and
other offering expenses, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants.
As of March 31, 2022,
we had not maintained compliance with the covenants of the Senior Notes and obtained a waiver from the Lender which waiver was contingent
on the completion an equity raise of at least $3.5 million, which was completed in June 2022. In consideration for obtaining a waiver
from the compliance with certain covenants, we agreed to amend the Senior Notes such that $5 million of principal loan balance becomes
convertible at $3.58 per share commencing after we raised the $5,000,000 of common equity (including the foregoing $3.5 million).
As of December 31, 2022,
we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $71,922,478 since inception and have not yet generated any meaningful income from operations.
Cash used in operating activities
Net
cash used in operating activities was $1,820,902 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to cash used in operating activities
of $3,020,650 for the same period in the prior year. Net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended December 31,
2022, included payments made for employee costs, professional fees to our consultants, attorneys and accountants for services. Net cash
used in operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and were primarily impacted by the increase in Accounts Receivable
due to the growth in our business, which was collected in January 2022. Cash flow from operations were also included payments made for,
professional fees to our consultants, attorneys and accountants required to complete the Acquisition.
Cash used in investing activities
Net
cash used in investing activities was $8,204 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 related to the purchase of fixed assets.
Net cash used in investing activities was $57,021,505 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and
was
related to the completion of the Acquisition. Also contributing to the cash used in investing activities in the comparable period were
purchase of fixed assets of $492,564 due primarily to opening of our office in Malta and purchase of software assets to support the new
wagering platform.
Cash used provided by financing activities
Net cash provided by financing
activities was $973,965 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the settlement of derivative instruments. Net cash provided
by financing activities was $62,736,837 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and was related to the issuance of Preferred Shares
and Senior Notes of $35,606,000 and $27,130,837, respectively. Offsetting these amounts were the direct issuance costs.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the appropriate time periods,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We, under the supervisions of and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial
officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer
and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective
because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of segregation of duties and the lack
of formal documentation of our control environment.
In light of the material weakness described above,
we continue to perform additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
There were no changes to our internal control over
financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially
effect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
The Company’s previous financial
advisor, Boustead Securities LLC (“Advisor”) has alleged a breach by the Company over the termination of their engagement
and the timing of the payment and amount of the fees owed to the Advisor (collectively the “Claims”). The fees the Company
expects to pay are accrued in the accompanying balance sheet. On June 2, 2022, the Advisor named EBET in an arbitration proceeding with
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) in connection with the Claims. The statement of claim alleges damages of
$5.7 million and seeks a declaration that the Company be required to utilize the Advisor for a certain follow-on offering pursuant to
an alleged right of first refusal between the parties. Arbitration is inherently unpredictable. However, the Company believes that it
has meritorious defenses to a portion of the alleged fee claim asserted and to the claim that the Company has any obligations pursuant
to a right of first refusal between the parties. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any
particular period by the resolution of this matter.
On September 15, 2022, the Company
filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against its former CTO Jason Finch for: (1) Breach of
Contract; (2) Violation of Nevada Revised Statutes section 205.511; (3) Conversion; and (4) Misappropriation of Trade Secrets.  In
the subject matter, we seek injunctive relief and demand damages and attorneys’ fees in an amount to be determined.  In reply
to our Complaint, Mr. Finch filed a Motion to Dismiss the matter and such motion is currently pending decision before the court.
Other than as described above,
we are not at this time involved in any additional legal proceedings that we believe could have a material effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
For a discussion of potential risks or uncertainties,
see “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Except as set forth
below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in such annual report.
Future sales of shares by our preferred stockholders could cause our
stock price to decline.
On November 29, 2021, in connection
with the Acquisition, we issued an aggregate of 37,700 shares of Preferred Stock for a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share, for aggregate
gross proceeds of $37,700,000 (the “Private Placement”). The Preferred Stock is convertible into common stock at an initial
conversion price of $28.00 per share (“Conversion Price”); provided that the Conversion Price is subject to anti-dilution
protection upon any subsequent transaction at a price lower than the Conversion Price then in effect. In addition, on April 28, 2023,
July 31, 2023 and October 31, 2023 (each, an “Adjustment Date”), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted to the lesser of:
(i) the Conversion Price in effect on the Adjustment Date, or (ii) 85% of the average closing price of the Company’s common stock
for the fifteen trading days prior to the Adjustment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjusted Conversion Price may not be less
than $0.71, unless the terms of the new adjustment dates are approved by our shareholders, as required pursuant to applicable rules and
regulations of NASDAQ. We agreed to submit for a vote the approval the terms of the new adjustment dates at our next meeting of shareholders
and use our reasonable best efforts to solicit our shareholders’ approval of such vote. The trading price of our common stock could
be adversely impacted if these preferred stockholders sell, or if the market believes such holders may sell, substantial amounts of our
common stock in the public market.

We are party to a Credit Agreement which contains
restrictive covenants, and if we are unable to comply with these covenants then upon notice of an event of default and/or event of material
adverse effect to lender, the lender could declare a default of the Credit Agreement wherein we would be required to immediately repay
the amounts due under the Credit Agreement.
On November 29, 2021, we entered
into a Credit Agreement with CP BF Lending, LLC (“Lender”) to finance the acquisition of the Aspire assets that we purchased
on the same date, via a term loan in the maximum principal amount of $30.0 million with a maturity of 36 months. The Credit Agreement
imposes various restrictions and contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, without limitation, certain reporting
obligations and certain limitations on restricted payments; and limitations on liens, encumbrances and indebtedness. In addition, borrowings
under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on our assets. If we fail to comply with the covenants or payments specified
in the Credit Agreement, the Lender could declare an event of default, which would give it the right to declare all borrowings outstanding,
together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, since the borrowings under the Credit
Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on our assets, upon such an event of default, the Lender may foreclose on our assets. The
amount of our outstanding indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our operations and liquidity, including by, among other things:
(i) making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions,
because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; (ii) causing us to use a larger portion of our cash
flows to fund interest and principal payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures
and other business activities; (iii) making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as
acquisition opportunities or other strategic transactions, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and (iv) limiting
our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund the activities and expenditures described above and for other general corporate
purposes as and when needed, which could force us to suspend, delay or curtail business prospects, strategies or operations. To date,
the Company has entered into a series of a total of 14 waiver agreements with the Lender providing for the limited waivers of default
as to specific financial and other covenants. The waivers were provided under certain terms and conditions and sometimes included fees
accrued to the principal balance amount due Lender under the Credit Agreement, and required the Company to repay $3,000,000 in principal
on January 10, 2023. These waivers will expire on April 28, 2023. We do not expect to satisfy the financial covenants that are subject
to the current waiver prior to April 28, 2023 and are currently in discussions with the Lender on modifying the financial covenants which
are the subject of the waiver. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in making such modifications to the Credit Agreement
and as such, no assurance that the Company will not default certain covenants existing in the Credit Agreement.
