DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION News Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “News Corporation,” “News Corp,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is a global diversified media and information services company comprised of businesses across a range of media, including: digital real estate services, subscription video services in Australia, news and information services and book publishing. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company, which are referred to herein as the “Consolidated Financial Statements,” have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected in these Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating results for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which the Company exercises significant influence but does not exercise control and is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are measured at fair value, if the fair value is readily determinable. If an investment’s fair value is not readily determinable, the Company will measure the investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. The consolidated statements of operations are referred to herein as the “Statements of Operations.” The consolidated balance sheets are referred to herein as the “Balance Sheets.” The consolidated statements of cash flows are referred to herein as the “Statements of Cash Flows.” The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 12, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to June 30. Fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 include 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. All references to the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 relate to the three and six months ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively. For convenience purposes, the Company continues to date its Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31. NOTE 2.

The Repurchase Program replaces the Company’s $ 500  million Class A Common Stock repurchase program approved by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”) in May 2013. The manner, timing, number and share price of any repurchases will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend upon such factors as the market price of the stock, general market conditions, applicable securities laws, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. The Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining authorized amount under the Repurchase Program was approximately $ 643  million. Stock repurchases commenced on November 9, 2021. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired
1.9
million and
6.9
million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock for approximately $ 31  million and $ 115  million, respectively, and
1.0
million and
3.5
million shares, respectively, of Class B Common Stock for approximately $ 16  million and $ 59  million, respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired
1.4
million shares of Class A Common Stock for approximately $ 31
million and
0.7  million shares of Class B Common Stock for approximately $ 15
million.
Dividends In August 2022, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $ 0.10
per share for Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The dividend was paid on October 12, 2022 to stockholders of record as of September 14, 2022. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors’ decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. 14 Table of Contents NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 8.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS In accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” (“ASC 820”) fair value measurements are required to be disclosed using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which distinguishes market participant assumptions into the following categories:  • Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. The Company could value assets and liabilities included in this level using dealer and broker quotations, certain pricing models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. • Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. For the Company, this primarily includes the use of forecasted financial information and other valuation related assumptions such as discount rates and long term growth rates in the income approach as well as the market approach which utilizes certain market and transaction multiples. Under ASC 820, certain assets and liabilities are required to be remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The following table summarizes those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: As of December 31, 2022 As of June 30, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Assets: Interest rate derivatives - cash flow hedges $ —   $ 43   $ —   $ 43   $ —   $ 24   $ —   $ 24   Foreign currency derivatives - cash flow hedges —   1   —   1   —   1   —   1   Cross-currency interest rate derivatives - fair value hedges —   8   —   8   —   19   —   19   Cross-currency interest rate derivatives

Equity securities The fair values of equity securities with quoted prices in active markets are determined based on the closing price at the end of each reporting period. These securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy outlined above. The fair values of equity securities without readily determinable fair market values are determined based on cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy outlined above. 15 Table of Contents NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A rollforward of the Company’s equity securities classified as Level 3 is as follows: For the six months ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance - beginning of period $ 103   $ 116   Additions (a) 30   15   Sales ( 2 ) —   Returns of capital ( 1 ) ( 33 ) Measurement adjustments 1   28   Foreign exchange and other (b) 1   ( 23 ) Balance - end of period $ 132   $ 103   (a)    Primarily relates to Dow Jones’ investment in an artificial intelligence-focused data analytics company during the three months ended December 31, 2022. (b)     During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company reclassified its investment in an equity security from Level 3 to Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy as the investment became publicly traded in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Derivative Instruments The Company is directly and indirectly affected by risks associated with changes in certain market conditions. When deemed appropriate, the Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the potential impact of these market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments include: • foreign currency exchange rate risk: arising primarily through Foxtel Debt Group borrowings denominated in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights; and • interest rate risk: arising from fixed and floating rate Foxtel Debt Group and News Corporation borrowings. The Company formally designates qualifying derivatives as hedge relationships (“hedges”) and applies hedge accounting when considered appropriate. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current in the Balance Sheets based on their maturity dates. Refer to the table below for further details: Balance Sheet Location As of December 31, 2022 As of June 30, 2022 (in millions) Foreign currency derivatives - cash flow hedges Other current assets $ 1   $ 1   Cross currency interest rate derivatives - fair value hedges Other current assets —   11   Interest rate derivatives - cash flow hedges Other current assets 14   4   Cross currency interest rate derivatives Other current assets —   46   Interest rate derivatives - cash flow hedges Other non-current assets 29   20   Cross-currency interest rate derivatives - fair value hedges Other non-current assets 8   8   Cross-currency interest rate derivatives Other non-current assets 34   33   Cash flow hedges The Company utilizes a combination of foreign currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives to mitigate currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk in relation to future interest and principal payments and payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights. The total notional value of foreign currency contract derivatives designated for hedging was $ 41
million as of December 31, 2022. The maximum hedged term over which the Company is hedging exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is less than
16 Table of Contents NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS one year . As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates that approximately
nil
of net derivative losses related to its foreign currency contract derivative cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into the Statements of Operations within the next 12 months. The total notional value of interest rate swap derivatives designated for hedging was approximately A$ 250
million and $ 500
million as of December 31, 2022 for Foxtel Debt Group and News Corporation borrowings, respectively. The maximum hedged term over which the Company is hedging exposure to variability in interest payments is to March 2027. As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates that approximately $ 19
million of net derivative gains related to its interest rate swap derivative cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into the Statements of Operations within the next 12 months. Cash flow derivatives The Company utilizes cross-currency interest rate derivatives to mitigate currency exchange and interest rate risk in relation to future interest and principal payments. The Company determined that these cash flow hedges no longer qualified as highly effective as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. Amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss during the periods the hedges were considered highly effective will continue to be reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining term of the derivatives. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives will be recognized within Other, net in the Statements of Operations on a prospective basis. The total notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps for which the Company discontinued hedge accounting was approximately $ 120
million as of December 31, 2022. The maximum hedged term over which the Company is hedging exposure to variability in interest and principal payments is to July 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates that approximately $ 1
million of net derivative gains related to its cross-currency interest rate swap derivative cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into the Statements of Operations within the next 12 months. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values had on Accumulated other comprehensive loss and the Statements of Operations during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for both derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that continue to be highly effective and derivatives initially designated as cash flow hedges but for which hedge accounting was discontinued as of December 31, 2020: Gain (loss) recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for the three months ended December 31, (Gain) loss reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for the three months ended December 31, Income statement location 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) Foreign currency derivatives - cash flow hedges $ ( 2 ) $ —   $ 1   $ —   Operating expenses Cross-currency interest rate derivatives —   —   ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Interest expense, net Interest rate derivatives - cash flow hedges ( 1 ) 4   ( 3 ) ( 1 ) Interest expense, net Total $ ( 3 ) $ 4   $ ( 3 ) $ ( 2 ) Gain (loss) recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for the six months ended December 31, (Gain) loss reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for the six months ended December 31, Income statement location 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) Foreign currency derivatives - cash flow hedges $ ( 1 ) $ 1   $ —   $ —   Operating expenses Cross-currency interest rate derivatives —   —   ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Interest expense, net Interest rate derivatives - cash flow hedges 21   6   ( 3 ) ( 2 ) Interest expense, net Total $ 20   $ 7   $ ( 4 ) $ ( 4 ) 17 Table of Contents NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The amounts recognized in Other, net in the Statements of Operations resulting from the changes in fair value of cross-currency interest rate derivatives that were discontinued as cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness as of December 31, 2020 was a loss of approximately $ 1
million and a gain of approximately $ 2
million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and gains of approximately $ 8
million and $ 17
million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Fair value hedges Borrowings in Australia issued at fixed rates and in U.S. dollars expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk. The Company manages fair value interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk through the use of cross-currency interest rate swaps under which the Company exchanges fixed interest payments equivalent to the interest payments on the U.S. dollar denominated debt for floating rate Australian dollar denominated interest payments. The changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items are recognized in Other, net. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, such adjustments decreased the carrying value of borrowings by
nil . The total notional value of the fair value hedges was approximately $ 30
million as of December 31, 2022. The maximum hedged term over which the Company is hedging exposure to variability in interest payments is to July 2024. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount recognized in the Statements of Operations on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges related to the ineffective portion was
nil
and the Company excluded the currency basis from the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The following sets forth the effect of fair value hedging relationships on hedged items in the Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: As of December 31, 2022 As of June 30, 2022 (in millions) Borrowings: Carrying amount of hedged item $ 28   $ 68   Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount —   2   Other Fair Value Measurements As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company’s outstanding borrowings approximates the fair value. The 2022 Senior Notes, 2021 Senior Notes and U.S. private placement borrowings are classified as Level 2 and the remaining borrowings are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 18 Table of Contents NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 9.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (“firm commitments”) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the current and future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations.
In December 2022, the Company extended the lease at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in New York, New York through fiscal 2042. The location houses the Company’s corporate headquarters as well as the executive and editorial offices for Dow Jones and the
New York Post . In connection with this extension, the Company will pay average rent of approximately $ 33  million per year through the remaining term. During September and December 2022, the Company amended and extended certain sports programming rights agreements. As a result, the Company has presented its commitments associated with its sports programming rights in the table below. As of December 31, 2022 Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years (in millions) Sports programming rights 3,959   499   1,038   1,036   1,386   The Company’s remaining commitments as of December 31, 2022 have not changed significantly from the disclosures included in the 2022 Form 10-K. Contingencies The Company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed below. The outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. 19 Table of Contents NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. Except as otherwise provided below, for the contingencies disclosed for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, the Company was unable to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. News America Marketing In May 2020, the Company sold its News America Marketing business. In the transaction, the Company retained certain liabilities, including those arising from the legal proceedings with Insignia Systems, Inc. (“Insignia”) and Valassis Communications, Inc. (“Valassis”) described below. Insignia Systems, Inc. In July 2019, Insignia filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against News America Marketing FSI L.L.C.

The trial began on June 29, 2021, and in July 2021, the parties agreed to settle the litigation and Valassis’s claims were dismissed with prejudice. HarperCollins Beginning in February 2021, a number of purported class action complaints have been filed in the N.Y. District Court against Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) and certain publishers, including the Company’s subsidiary, HarperCollins Publishers, L.L.C. (“HarperCollins” and together with the other publishers, the “Publishers”), alleging violations of antitrust and competition laws. The complaints seek treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. In September 2022, the N.Y. District Court granted Amazon and the Publishers’ motions to dismiss the complaints but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed amended complaints in both cases in November 2022, and in January 2023, Amazon and the Publishers filed motions to dismiss the amended complaints. While it is not possible at this time to predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of these actions, HarperCollins believes it has been compliant with applicable laws and intends to defend itself vigorously. U.K. Newspaper Matters Civil claims have been brought against the Company with respect to, among other things, voicemail interception and inappropriate payments to public officials at the Company’s former publication,
The News of the World , and at  The Sun , and related matters (the “U.K. Newspaper Matters”). The Company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases. The Company also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme which was closed to new claims after April 8, 2013. In connection with the separation of the Company from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (“21st Century Fox”) on June 28, 2013, the Company and 21st Century Fox agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that 21st Century Fox would indemnify the Company for payments made after such date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the U.K. Newspaper Matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the previously concluded criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees (i) who are not directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, who are not co-defendants with the Company or 21st Century Fox. 21st Century Fox’s indemnification obligations with respect to these matters are settled on an after-tax basis. In March 2019, as
20 Table of Contents NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS part of the separation of FOX Corporation (“FOX”) from 21st Century Fox, the Company, News Corp Holdings UK & Ireland, 21st Century Fox and FOX entered into a Partial Assignment and Assumption Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, 21st Century Fox assigned, conveyed and transferred to FOX all of its indemnification obligations with respect to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The net expense related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters in Selling, general and administrative was $ 3
million and $ 4
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 9
million and $ 6
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has provided for its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed and costs incurred, including liabilities associated with employment taxes, and has accrued approximately $ 118
million. The amount to be indemnified by FOX of approximately $ 114
million was recorded as a receivable in Other current assets on the Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022. It is not possible to estimate the liability or corresponding receivable for any additional claims that may be filed given the information that is currently available to the Company. If more claims are filed and additional information becomes available, the Company will update the liability provision and corresponding receivable for such matters. The Company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims. It is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof could damage its reputation, impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. Other The Company’s tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company’s tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. However, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur. NOTE 11.
INCOME TAXES At the end of each interim period, the Company estimates the annual effective tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary quarterly earnings. The tax expense or benefit related to significant, unusual or extraordinary items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect are individually computed and recognized in the interim period in which those items occur. In addition, the effects of changes in enacted tax laws or rates or tax status are recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $ 61
million on pre-tax income of $ 155
million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $ 96
million on pre-tax income of $ 256
million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax expense of $ 99
million on pre-tax income of $ 361
million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by changes in valuation allowances. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax expense of $ 170
million on pre-tax income of $ 699
million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by changes in valuation allowances, offset by the lower tax impact related to the acquisition of an
18 % interest in PropertyGuru. 21 Table of Contents NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management assesses available evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets. Based on management’s assessment of available evidence, it has been determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established against those tax assets. The Company’s tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company’s tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. The Company is currently undergoing tax examinations in various U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently undergoing an audit with the Internal Revenue Service for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. However, the Company may need to accrue additional income tax expense and its liability may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as these tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur. The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA implements a 15% corporate minimum tax on corporations with over $1 billion of financial statement income, a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. On December 27, 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department provided additional guidance on the corporate minimum tax and the excise tax on stock repurchases. The Company is not expected to be subject to the corporate minimum tax and it will be subject to the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases.
The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting has agreed on a two-pillar approach to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the global economy by (1) allocating profits to market jurisdictions (“Pillar One”) and (2) ensuring multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax regardless of where the headquarters are located or the jurisdictions in which the company operates (“Pillar Two”). Pillar One targets multinational groups with global revenue exceeding 20 billion Euros and a profit-to-revenue ratio of more than 10%. Companies subject to Pillar One will be required to allocate profits and pay taxes to market jurisdictions. Based on the current proposed revenue and profit thresholds, the Company does not expect to be subject to tax changes associated with Pillar One. Pillar Two establishes a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% for multinational groups with annual global revenue exceeding 750 million Euros. On December 15, 2022, EU Member States unanimously adopted a directive implementing the global minimum tax rules of Pillar Two requiring members to enact the directive into their national laws by the end of 2023. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax proposals on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company paid gross income taxes of $ 81
million and $ 92
million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and received tax refunds of $ 1
million and $ 1
million, respectively. NOTE 12.

As a result of the letter, the Special Committee has been dissolved. Potential Disposition of Move In January 2023, the Company announced that it was engaged in discussions with CoStar Group, Inc. regarding a potential sale of its subsidiary, Move, Inc. However, there is no assurance regarding the timing or completion of any transaction. Russian and Ukrainian conflict The Company has taken steps to ensure the safety of its journalists and other personnel in Ukraine and Russia and will continue to monitor the situation in the region and provide support, as needed, to affected employees. The Company has extremely limited operations in, or direct exposure to, Russia or Ukraine, and the conflict has not had a material impact on its business, financial condition, or results of operations to date. However, the conflict has broadened inflationary pressures and a further escalation or expansion of its scope or the related economic disruption could impact the Company's supply chain, further exacerbate inflation and other macroeconomic trends and have an adverse effect on its results of operations. Announced Headcount Reduction In response to the macroeconomic challenges facing many of the Company’s businesses, the Company expects to continue to implement cost savings initiatives, including an expected 5% headcount reduction or around 1,250 positions, this calendar year. While it is still evaluating the cost savings opportunity from this action, the Company expects this to generate an annualized cost savings of at least $130 million. The Company expects the charges related to this action to pay back in a year. See Note 3—Acquisitions in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the acquisitions discussed above. 29 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations—For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 versus the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 The following table sets forth the Company’s operating results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021.

The revenue decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by decreases at the Book Publishing segment due to lower print and digital book sales in the U.S. market due to slowing consumer demand industry-wide, difficult frontlist comparisons and some logistical constraints at Amazon, at the Digital Real Estate Services segment due to lower real estate revenues at Move and REA Group, the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower financial services revenue at REA Group and at the News Media and Subscription Video Services segments primarily due to the negative impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. The decreases were partially offset by higher revenues at the Dow Jones segment primarily due to the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $171 million, or 6%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. The revenue decrease for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was driven by the decrease at the Book Publishing segment, primarily due to lower print and digital book sales in the U.S. market due to slowing consumer demand industry-wide, difficult frontlist comparisons and the impact of Amazon’s reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint, the negative impacts of foreign currency fluctuations at the News Media and Subscription Video Services segments and the decrease at the Digital Real Estate Services segment driven by the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, lower real estate revenues at Move and lower financial services revenue at REA Group. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues at the Dow Jones segment primarily due to the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $324 million, or 6%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. 30 Table of Contents The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period. Operating expenses — Operating expenses increased $15 million, or 1%, and $44 million, or 2%, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by higher expenses at the Dow Jones segment due to the impact from recent acquisitions and higher employee costs and at the News Media segment due to higher costs for TalkTV and other digital investments, primarily at News Corp Australia, and the $21 million impact of higher pricing on newsprint costs, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and cost savings initiatives. The increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses at the Subscription Video Services segment due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming rights costs, and at the Book Publishing segment primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as higher manufacturing, freight and distribution costs were largely offset by the impact of lower sales volumes. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in an Operating expense decrease of $84 million, or 7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. The increase in operating expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by higher expenses at the Dow Jones segment due to the impact from recent acquisitions and higher employee costs and at the News Media segment primarily due to higher costs for TalkTV and other digital investments, primarily at News Corp Australia, and the $41 million impact of higher pricing on newsprint costs, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and cost savings initiatives. The increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses at the Subscription Video Services and Book Publishing segments driven by the positive impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of lower sales volumes at the Book Publishing segment. Those positive impacts were partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming rights costs at the Subscription Video Services segment and higher manufacturing, freight and distribution costs at the Book Publishing segment. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in an Operating expense decrease of $158 million, or 6%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. Selling, general and administrative — Selling, general and administrative decreased $34 million, or 4%, and $27 million, or 2%, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was driven by lower expenses at the Digital Real Estate Services, Subscription Video Services, News Media and Book Publishing segments, primarily driven by the positive impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by increased expenses at the Other segment due to higher equity-based compensation costs largely related to stock price performance and $6 million of one-time costs related to the professional fees incurred by the Special Committee and the Company in connection with evaluating the proposal from the Murdoch Family Trust and at the Dow Jones segment due to the impact of recent acquisitions and higher employee costs. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Selling, general and administrative decrease of $57 million, or 7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was driven by lower expenses at the Book Publishing segment due to lower employee costs and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and at the Subscription Video Services, News Media and Digital Real Estate Services segments, primarily due to the positive impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher expenses at the Dow Jones segment due to the impact of recent acquisitions and higher employee costs and at the Other segment due to higher equity-based compensation costs largely related to stock price performance and $6 million of one-time costs related to the professional fees incurred by the Special Committee and the Company in connection with evaluating the proposal from the Murdoch Family Trust. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Selling, general and administrative decrease of $113 million, or 7%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. Depreciation and amortization — Depreciation and amortization expense increased $6 million, or 4%, and $20 million, or 6%, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher amortization expense resulting from the Company’s recent acquisitions .
The impact of foreign
31 Table of Contents currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $12 million, or 7%, and $21 million, or 6%, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022.
Impairment and restructuring charges — During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $19 million and $40 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $23 million and $45 million, respectively. See Note 4—Restructuring Programs in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity losses of affiliates — Equity losses of affiliates increased by $23 million and $27 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022, primarily due to losses from an investment in a newly launched Australian sports wagering venture. See Note 5—Investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense, net — Interest expense, net increased by $5 million and $10 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the issuance of $500 million of senior notes due 2032 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 (the “2022 Senior Notes”) and the incurrence of $500 million in loans under a new unsecured term loan A credit facility (the “Term A Facility” and the loans under the Term A Facility are collectively referred to as “Term A Loans”) in March 2022. See Note 6—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Other, net — Other, net improved by $1 million, or 14%, and decreased by $154 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022. The decline in the six month period was primarily due to the absence of REA Group’s gain on disposition of its entities in Malaysia and Thailand recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. See Note 13—Additional Financial Information in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Income tax expense — For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $61 million on pre-tax income of $155 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $96 million on pre-tax income of $256 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that is higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax expense of $99 million on pre-tax income of $361 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by changes in valuation allowances. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax expense of $170 million on pre-tax income of $699 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and by changes in valuation allowances, offset by the lower tax impact related to the acquisition of an 18% interest in PropertyGuru. Management assesses available evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets. Based on management’s assessment of available evidence, it has been determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established against those tax assets. See Note 11—Income Taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income —Net income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was $94 million and $160 million, respectively, compared to net income of $262 million and $529 million for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $168 million, or 64%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by lower Total Segment EBITDA and higher losses from equity affiliates, partially offset by lower income tax expense. 32 Table of Contents Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $369 million, or 70%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by lower Total Segment EBITDA and Other, net and higher losses from equity affiliates, partially offset by lower income tax expense. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests —Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was flat and decreased by $45 million, or 46%, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022. The decrease in the six month period was primarily driven by lower earnings at REA Group due to the absence of the $107 million gain from the disposition of its entities in Malaysia and Thailand recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Segment Analysis Segment EBITDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources within, the Company’s businesses. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company’s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). Total Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operations and other factors that affect the Company’s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods. The following table reconciles Net income to Total Segment EBITDA for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: For the three months ended December 31, For the six months ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) Net income $ 94  $ 262  $ 160  $ 529  Add: Income tax expense 61  99  96  170  Other, net 6  7  24  (130) Interest expense, net 26  21  53  43  Equity losses of affiliates 29  6  33  6  Impairment and restructuring charges 19  23  40  45  Depreciation and amortization 174  168  353  333  Total Segment EBITDA $ 409  $ 586  $ 759  $ 996  33 Table of Contents The following tables set forth the Company’s Revenues and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: For the three months ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Revenues Segment EBITDA Revenues Segment EBITDA Digital Real Estate Services $ 386  $ 128  $ 456  $ 178  Subscription Video Services 462  90  498  86  Dow Jones 563  139  508  144  Book Publishing 531  51  617  107  News Media 579  59  638  111  Other —  (58) —  (40) Total $ 2,521  $ 409  $ 2,717  $ 586  For the six months ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Revenues Segment EBITDA Revenues Segment EBITDA Digital Real Estate Services $ 807  $ 247  $ 882  $ 316  Subscription Video Services 964  201  1,008  200  Dow Jones 1,078  252  952  239  Book Publishing 1,018  90  1,163  192  News Media 1,132  77  1,214  145  Other —  (108) —  (96) Total $ 4,999  $ 759  $ 5,219  $ 996  Digital Real Estate Services

At REA Group, revenues decreased $47 million, or 16%, to $240 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $287 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to the $26 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, lower financial services revenue driven by lower settlements and lower Australian residential revenues due to a decrease in national listings. The decreases were partially offset by price increases, increased depth penetration for Australian residential and commercial products, increased penetration of Premiere Plus and higher revenues at REA India. Revenues at Move decreased $23 million, or 14%, to $146 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $169 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the impact of the macroeconomic environment on the housing market, including higher interest rates. The market downturn resulted in lower lead volumes, which decreased 37%, and lower transaction volumes. Revenues from the referral model, which includes the ReadyConnect Concierge℠ product, and the traditional lead generation product decreased due to these factors.
34 Table of Contents Revenues from the referral model generated approximately 27% of total Move revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to approximately 32% for the corresponding period of fiscal 2022.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Segment EBITDA at the Digital Real Estate Services segment decreased $50 million, or 28%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, mainly driven by the lower revenues discussed above and the $13 million, or 7%, negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower broker commissions at REA Group. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment decreased $75 million, or 9%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. Revenues at REA Group decreased $41 million, or 8%, to $492 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $533 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2022 due to the $46 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Higher revenues due to price increases, increased depth penetration for Australian residential and commercial products and increased penetration of Premiere Plus and higher revenues at REA India were partially offset by the impact of lower national listings on residential products and a decrease in financial services revenue driven by lower settlements. Revenues at Move decreased $34 million, or 10%, to $315 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $349 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the impact of the macroeconomic environment on the housing market, including higher interest rates. The market downturn resulted in lower lead volumes, which decreased 34%, and lower transaction volumes. Revenues from the referral model, which includes the ReadyConnect Concierge℠ product, and the traditional lead generation product decreased due to these factors. Revenues from the referral model generated approximately 29% of total Move revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to approximately 32% in the corresponding period of fiscal 2022.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Segment EBITDA at the Digital Real Estate Services segment decreased $69 million, or 22%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to the lower revenues discussed above, the $22 million, or 7%, negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and higher employee and marketing costs related to strategic investments at both Move and REA Group, partially offset by lower broker commissions at REA Group.

The $32 million increase in streaming revenues, primarily due to increased volume and pricing at Kayo and
BINGE , and the $9 million increase in commercial subscription revenues due to the absence of COVID-19 related restrictions imposed in fiscal 2022 more than offset lower residential subscription revenues resulting from fewer residential broadcast subscribers and lower advertising revenues. Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 26% of total circulation and subscription revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 19% in the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $52 million, or 10%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Segment EBITDA increased $4 million, or 5%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, including the $10 million, or 11%, negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue drivers discussed above and lower transmission and marketing costs were partially offset by higher sports

and the $23 million increase in commercial subscription revenues due to the absence of COVID-19 related restrictions imposed in fiscal 2022 more than offset lower residential subscription revenues resulting from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 26% of total circulation and subscription revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 19% in the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $92 million, or 9%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Segment EBITDA increased $1 million, or 1%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, including the $19 million, or 9%, negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue drivers discussed above and lower transmission costs were partially offset by higher sports programming rights and production costs due to contractual increases, enhanced digital rights and the timing of sporting events, primarily motorsports, and higher entertainment programming rights costs due to the availability of content.

Softness in consumer demand is expected to continue in the near-term. Digital sales decreased by 7% as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022 driven by lower e-book sales. Digital sales represented approximately 19% of consumer revenues, as compared to 17% in the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, and backlist sales represented approximately 57% of total revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2022.

For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Segment EBITDA at the Book Publishing segment decreased $56 million, or 52%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to the lower revenues discussed above and higher manufacturing, freight and distribution costs related to ongoing supply chain, inventory and inflationary pressures, partially offset by lower costs due to lower sales volumes and lower employee costs. These supply chain, inventory and inflationary pressures are expected to continue to impact the business in the near term. To mitigate these pressures, the Company has implemented price increases, will reduce headcount and continue to evaluate its cost base. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, revenues at the Book Publishing segment decreased $145 million, or 12%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by lower print and digital book sales primarily in the U.S. market due to slowing consumer demand industry-wide, difficult frontlist comparisons, Amazon’s reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint, which negatively impacted print book sales, and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Digital sales decreased by 3% as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2022 due to lower e-book sales, partially offset by growth in downloadable audiobooks.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Current Financial Condition The Company’s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion. The Company also has available borrowing capacity under its new revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. The Company currently expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months, including repayment of indebtedness. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for at least the next 12 months, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the financial and operational performance of the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable, (ii) the Company’s credit ratings and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable, (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents, (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets and (v) the state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s consolidated assets included $740 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. Of this amount, $97 million is cash not readily accessible by the Company as it is held by REA Group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. REA Group must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The principal uses of cash that affect the Company’s liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs, paper purchases and programming costs; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; acquisitions; the repurchase of shares; dividends; and the repayment of debt and related interest. In addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the Company’s securities or the assumption of indebtedness. 41 Table of Contents Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On September 22, 2021, the Company announced a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $1 billion in the aggregate of its outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (the “Repurchase Program”). The Repurchase Program replaces the Company’s $500 million Class A Common Stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2013. The manner, timing, number and share price of any repurchases will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend upon such factors as the market price of the stock, general market conditions, applicable securities laws, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. The Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining authorized amount under the Repurchase Program was approximately $643 million. Stock repurchases commenced on November 9, 2021. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 1.9 million and 6.9 million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock for approximately $31 million and $115 million, respectively, and 1.0 million and 3.5 million shares, respectively, of Class B Common Stock for approximately $16 million and $59 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 1.4 million shares of Class A Common Stock for approximately $31 million and 0.7 million shares of Class B Common Stock for approximately $15 million. See Note 7—Equity in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends In August 2022, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The dividend was paid on October 12, 2022 to stockholders of record as of September 14, 2022. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors’ decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.

REA Group minority stockholders and used $43 million to repurchase outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock under the Repurchase Program. The net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by new borrowings of $495 million primarily related to REA Group.
Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Available to News Corporation Free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and free cash flow available to News Corporation is defined as free cash flow, less REA Group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from REA Group. Free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow. The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company’s liquidity and cash flow trends. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation, which adjusts free cash flow to exclude REA Group’s free cash flow and include dividends received from REA Group, provides management and investors with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the Company, as REA Group is a separately listed public company in Australia and must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation provides a more conservative view of the Company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the Company actually receives from REA Group, which has generally been lower than the Company’s unadjusted free cash flow. A limitation of both free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation is that they do not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporate all cash movements during the period. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation: For the six months ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 161  $ 430  Less: Capital expenditures (217) (208) Free cash flow (56) 222  Less: REA Group free cash flow (96) (121) Plus: Cash dividends received from REA Group 50  43  Free cash flow available to News Corporation $ (102) $ 144  Free cash flow in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $(56) million compared to $222 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash provided by operating activities, as discussed above. Free cash flow available to News Corporation in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $(102) million compared to $144 million in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower free cash flow as discussed above, partially offset by higher dividends received from REA Group. 43 Table of Contents Borrowings As of December 31, 2022, the Company, certain subsidiaries of NXE Australia Pty Limited (the “Foxtel Group” and together with such subsidiaries, the “Foxtel Debt Group”) and REA Group and certain of its subsidiaries (REA Group and certain of its subsidiaries, the “REA Debt Group”) had total borrowings of $3.0 billion, including the current portion.

In addition to third-party indebtedness, the Foxtel Debt Group has related party indebtedness, including A$700 million of outstanding principal of shareholder loans and A$200 million of available shareholder facilities from the Company. The shareholder loans bear interest at a variable rate of the Australian BBSY plus an applicable margin ranging from 6.30% to 7.75% and mature in December 2027. The shareholder revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate of the Australian BBSY plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.75%, depending on the Foxtel Debt Group’s net leverage ratio, and matures in July 2024. Additionally, the Foxtel Debt Group has an A$170 million subordinated shareholder loan facility with Telstra which can be used to finance cable transmission costs due to Telstra. The Telstra Facility bears interest at a variable rate of the Australian BBSY plus an applicable margin of 7.75% and matures in December 2027. The Company excludes the utilization of the Telstra Facility from the Statements of Cash Flows because it is non-cash.

Commitments The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (“firm commitments”) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the current and future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations.

44 Table of Contents and the
New York Post . In connection with this extension, the Company will pay average rent of approximately $33 million per year through the remaining term. During September and December 2022, the Company amended and extended certain sports programming rights agreements. As a result, the Company has presented its commitments associated with its sports programming rights in the table below. As of December 31, 2022 Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years (in millions) Sports programming rights 3,959  499  1,038  1,036  1,386  The Company’s remaining commitments as of December 31, 2022 have not changed significantly from the disclosures included in the 2022 Form 10-K. Contingencies The Company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. See Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company’s tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. However, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to market risk since its presentation set forth in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 45 Table of Contents (b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company’s second quarter of fiscal 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 46 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 1.
