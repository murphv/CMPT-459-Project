otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this subsection to “we,” “us,”, “our”,
“the Company”, and other similar terms refer to Digerati and its subsidiaries prior to the Business Combination and to New
Digerati and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Business Combination.
Digerati Technologies,
Inc., a Nevada corporation, through its operating subsidiaries in Texas, Florida and California that includes Shift8 Networks, Inc.,

the new name of Verve Cloud, Inc. It is expected that the new name and brand will be fully implemented across the Company’s products
and services before the end of Digerati’s fiscal year-end on July 31, 2023.
Basis of presentation and consolidation
The accompanying
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Digerati Technologies, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion
of management, these interim financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a
fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements,
which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended July
31, 2022, contained in the Company’s Form 10-K filed on October 31, 2022, have been omitted.
Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with
the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations or net assets of the Company.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
Basic and diluted
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding during the period. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to
common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the respective period presented in the
Company’s accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Fully-diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similarly
to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of dilutive Common Stock equivalents
using the treasury stock method for options and warrants and the if-converted method for convertible debt.

Treasury
Shares
As a result of
entering into various convertible debt instruments which contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, warrants with fixed exercise
price, and convertible notes with fixed conversion price or with a conversion price floor, we reserved 80,000,000 treasury shares for
consideration for future conversions and exercise of warrants, for convertible notes with fixed conversion price, notes with variable
conversion feature with a floor and warrants with a conversion price floor.
The Company will evaluate the reserved treasury shares on
a quarterly basis, and if necessary, reserve additional treasury shares. As of January 31, 2023, we believe that the treasury shares
reserved are sufficient for any future conversions of these instruments. As a result, these debt instruments and warrants are excluded
from derivative consideration.
Customers
and Suppliers
We rely on various
suppliers to provide services in connection with our VOIP and UCaaS offerings. Our customers include businesses in various industries
including Healthcare, Banking, Financial Services, Legal, Real Estate, and Construction. We are not dependent upon any single supplier
or customer.
During the six
months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not derive revenues of
10 % or more from any single customer.
As of January 31,
2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company did not have outstanding accounts receivable of
10 % or more from any single customer.

Sources of revenue:
The Company recognizes cloud-based hosted services
revenue, mainly from subscription services for its cloud telephony applications that includes hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call
center applications, auto attendant, voice, and web conferencing, call recording, messaging, voicemail to email conversion, integrated
mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and other customized applications. Other services include enterprise-class
data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network),
fiber, and Ethernet over copper. We also offer remote network monitoring, data backup and disaster recovery services. The Company applies
a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (i) identifying the contract with a customer,
(ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Substantially
all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer.
Service Revenue
Service revenue from subscriptions to the Company’s
cloud-based technology platform is recognized over time on a rateable basis over the contractual subscription term beginning on the date
that the platform is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of subscription services being rendered are recorded
as deferred revenue. Usage fees, either bundled or not bundled, are recognized when the Company has a right to invoice. Professional
services for configuration, system integration, optimization, customer training and/or education are primarily billed on a fixed-fee
basis and are performed by the Company directly. Alternatively, customers may choose to perform these services themselves or engage their
own third-party service providers. Professional services revenue is recognized over time, generally as services are activated for the
customer.
Product Revenue
The Company recognizes product revenue for telephony
equipment at a point in time, when transfer of control has occurred, which is generally upon delivery. Sales returns are recorded as
a reduction to revenue estimated based on historical data.
Disaggregation of Cloud-based hosted revenues.

Contract Assets
Contract assets are recorded for those parts
of the contract consideration not yet invoiced but for which the performance obligations are completed. The revenue is recognized when
the customer receives services or equipment for a reduced consideration at the onset of an arrangement; for example, when the initial
month’s services or equipment are discounted. Contract assets are included in prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated
balance sheets, depending on if their reduction is recognized during the succeeding 12-month period or beyond. Contract assets as of
January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 was $ 5,189
and $ 6,701 , respectively.
Deferred Income
Deferred income represents billings or payment
received in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized upon transfer of control. Balances consist primarily of annual plan subscription
services, for services not yet provided as of the balance sheet date. Deferred revenues that will be recognized during the succeeding
12-month period are recorded as current deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder recorded as other noncurrent
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred income as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 was $ 347,177
and $ 66,167 , respectively.
Customer deposits
The
Company in some instances requires customers to make deposits for last month of services, equipment, installation charges and training.
As equipment is installed and training takes places the deposits are then applied to revenue. The deposit for the last month of services
is applied to any outstanding balances if services are cancelled. If the customer’s account is paid in full, the Company will refund
the full deposit in the month following service termination. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, Digerati’s customer deposits
balance was $ 859,733
and $ 864,345 , respectively. The customer deposit balance is included as part of deferred income on the consolidated
balance sheets.

Costs to Obtain a Customer Contract
Direct incremental costs of obtaining a contract,
consisting of sales commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer, which currently averages
36
months.
The Company calculates the estimated life of the customer on an annual basis. The Company classifies deferred commissions as prepaid expenses
or other noncurrent assets based on the timing of when it expects to recognize the expense. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has $ 490,858
in deferred commissions/contract costs. Sales commissions expensed for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 1,327,284
and $ 654,070 , respectively. The cost to obtain customer contract balance is included as part of prepaid expenses and other assets on the
consolidated balance sheets.
Direct Costs - Cloud software and service
We incur bandwidth and colocation charges in
connection with our UCaaS or cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connectivity between our
customers to allow them access to our various services. We also incur costs from underlying providers for fiber, internet broadband,
and telecommunication circuits in connection with our data and connectivity solutions.
Derivative financial instruments .
Digerati does not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati evaluates its convertible instruments and free-standing
instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting.
For derivative financial instruments that are
accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting
date. Any changes in fair value are recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period. For derivative notes
payable conversion options and warrants Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments.
The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement
of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that
would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires
an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value
hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
Level 1
–
Quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 –
Observable inputs other
than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3
–
Unobservable inputs that
are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires
significant judgment or estimation.
For certain of our financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due
to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.
Our derivative liabilities as of January 31,
2023 and July 31, 2022 were approximately $ 9,879,046
and $ 10,587,717 , respectively.

Noncontrolling interest
The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810,  Consolidation,  which governs
the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (“NCIs”) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the
loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of this standard indicate, among other things, that NCIs be treated as a separate
component of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parent’s ownership interest that leave control intact
be treated as equity transactions rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially owned
consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the NCI even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance. The net income (loss) attributed
to the NCI is separately designated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
On May 1, 2018, T3 Communications, Inc. (“T3”),
a Nevada Corporation, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), whereby in an exchange for $250,000, T3 agreed to
sell to the buyers 199,900 shares of common stock equivalent to 19.99% of the issued and outstanding common shares of T3. The $250,000
of the cash received under this transaction was recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and
as an increase in additional paid-in capital in T3. At the option of the Company, and for a period of five years following the date of
the SPA, the 199,900 shares of common stock in T3 may be converted into Common Stock of Digerati at a ratio of 3.4 shares of DTGI Common
stock for everyone (1) share of T3 at any time after the DTGI Common Stock has a current market price of $1.50 or more per share for
20 consecutive trading days.
For
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company accounted for a noncontrolling interest of approximately $ 489,000
and $ 760,000 , respectively. Additionally, one of the buyers serves as a Board Member of T3 Communications, Inc., a Florida Corporation,
one of our operating subsidiaries.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Recent accounting pronouncements, other than
below, issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC did not, or are not, believed by management
to have a material effect on the Company’s present or future financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued “ASU 2020-06,
Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 47020) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40)” which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance removes certain accounting models which separate
the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible instruments. Either a modified retrospective method of transition
or a fully retrospective method of transition is permissible for the adoption of this standard. Update No. 2020-06 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the
potential impact of this ASU on its financial statements.

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
Financial Condition
The Company’s consolidated financial statements
for the six months ending January 31, 2023, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the Company’s inception in 1993, the Company has incurred
net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $ 118,153,000
and a working capital deficit of approximately $ 40,765,000
which raise
substantial doubt about Digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management Plans to Continue as a Going
Concern
Management believes that available resources
as of January 31, 2023 will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations and corporate expenses over the next 12 months.
The Company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, and other things,
raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team in lieu of cash, or
generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure
such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales of assets, or collaborative arrangements.
If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders
will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock
or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its
operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators
or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable
terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail its operations, and the Company may not
be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.
We are currently taking initiatives to reduce
our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During fiscal 2023 certain members of our management team will continue to receive
a portion of their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash. To strengthen our business, we intend
to adopt best practices from or recent acquisitions and invest in a marketing and sales strategy to grow our monthly recurring revenue;
we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers and channel partners to tap into new sources of revenue streams; and we have also secured
numerous agent agreements through our recent acquisitions that we anticipate will accelerate revenue growth. In addition, we will continue
to focus on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort to increase our revenues,
we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. As a
result, during the due diligence process we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional fees.
We
require cash to meet our interest payments to Post Road (as defined below), capital expenditure needs, and operational cash flow
needs. The Company anticipates issuing additional equity or entering into additional Convertible Notes to secure the funding
required to meet these cash needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them
on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to meet its
interest payments, capital expenditures and operational needs. As a result, the Company will be required to negotiate with its
lender the terms of the current financing agreements, in addition to postponing the timing of deployment of its capital expenditures
and extending the timing of the operational cash needs.
In November 2020, the Company and T3 and T3’s
subsidiaries (T3 and its subsidiaries, collectively, “the T3 Nevada Parties”) entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit
Agreement”) with Post Road Administrative LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund II LLP (collectively, “Post
Road”). The Company is a party to certain sections of the Credit Agreement. Next Level Internet, Inc. became a T3 Nevada Party
in February 2022.
11
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations,
warranties, and indemnification provisions. The Credit Agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants with respect to operation
of the business and properties of the loan parties as well as financial performance. Below are key covenants requirements, (measured
quarterly) beginning with the quarter ended April 30, 2023:
●
Maximum Allowed - Senior
Leverage Ratio of 6.18 to 1.00
●
Minimum Allowed - EBITDA of $ 4,565,009
●
Minimum Allowed - Liquidity
of $2,000,000
●
Maximum Allowed - Capital
Expenditures of $175,000
(Quarterly)
●
Minimum Allowed - Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.00 to 1.00
●
Maximum Allowed - Churn of 3.00% at any
time
On December 15, 2022, the lender agreed to forbear
from exercising its remedies in connection with the financial covenants that were not complied with during the quarter ended October
31,2022, as well as certain other specified defaults, until December 23, 2022 or such later date as agreed to in writing by the lender.
On February 3, 2023,
the Company, the T3 Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into a Consent, Limited Waiver and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and
Amendment to Notes (the “Fourth Amendment”). Among other things, the Fourth Amendment revises each of the six financial covenants
set forth in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement (related to maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, minimum EBITDA, maximum capital expenditures,
minimum interest coverage (a provision that replaces the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio provision), and maximum churn). In addition,
pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, none of the financial covenants contained in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement, as amended by the
Fourth Amendment, other than minimum liquidity of $ 1,000,000 , which was tested and met as of January 31, 2023. The Fourth Amendment provides
that these revised financial covenants will be null and void if the Merger (as defined in Note 12) does not close by February 28, 2023
(the “Merger Outside Closing Date”), in which case the financial covenants in effect under Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement
immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment shall apply and be deemed effective.
Pursuant to the Fourth
Amendment, Post Road agreed to waive each and all of the Specified Defaults (as defined in the Fourth Amendment). Post Road’s waiver
of the Specified Defaults are contingent on the Merger closing on or before the Merger Outside Closing Date and no events of default (other
than the Specified Defaults) or any condition or event that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute
an event of default, existing under the Credit Agreement on the Merger closing date.
In addition, the Credit
Agreement permits T3 to defer until the respective maturity dates of the Notes the payment of accrued and unpaid interest otherwise due
and payable. The Fourth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement and the Notes to revise the interest rate payable by T3 including pursuant
to the deferral of the interest payments.
On March 13, 2023, the
Company, the T3 Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into the Fifth Amendment to its Credit Agreement, with an effective date of February
28, 2023, which specifically revises the Merger Outside Closing Date, replacing the “February 28, 2023” date with “April
28, 2023,” without amending, supplementing or otherwise modifying any other terms, or any of the conditions, set forth in the Credit
Agreement.
While Digerati, the parent company of T3, is
not subject to these financial covenants, they have had and will continue to have a material impact on T3 expenditures and ability to
raise funds.
In addition, our Term Loan C Note with Post Road
with a maturity date of
August 4, 2023 , requires a full principal payment (currently $ 10,000,000 ) and accrued interest by the maturity
date. We will work with our equity partners to secure additional financings to meet this obligation by the maturity date. In addition,
we will work with our lender on the current terms to the Term Loan C Note, to extend the maturity date or restructure the terms of the
note. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms to meet the
cash payment requirements on the Term Loan C Note. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure the terms
or extend the maturity date of the Term Loan C Note with Post Road. If the Company is not able to restructure the financing or repay
the Term Loan C Note by the August 4 th
maturity date and Post Road declares an event of default, it would have a material
adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including the possibility of Post Road foreclosing on some or all of our assets.
T3’s obligations under the Credit Agreement
are secured by a first-priority security interest in all of the assets of T3 and guaranteed by the other subsidiaries of the Company
pursuant to the Guaranty and Collateral Agreement, dated November 17, 2020, subsequently amended on December 31, 2021, February 4, 2022,
December 15, 2022, and February 3, 2023 by and among T3, the Company’s other subsidiaries, and Post Road Administrative LLC (the
“Guaranty and Collateral Agreement”). In addition, T3’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are, pursuant to a Pledge
Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”), secured by a pledge of a first priority security interest in T3’s
100 % equity ownership
of each of T3’s operating companies.
We have been successful in raising debt and equity
capital in the past and as described in Notes 6, 7, 8, and 12. Although we have successfully completed financings and reduced expenses
in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful.
12
The current Credit Agreement with Post Road will
allow the Company to continue acquiring UCaaS service providers that meet the Company’s acquisition criteria. Management anticipates
that future acquisitions will provide additional operating revenues to the Company as it continues to execute on its consolidation strategy.

NOTE 12 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On February 3, 2023,
the Company, the T3 Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into the “Fourth Amendment.” Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment,
Post Road, contingent on the Bridge Loan Repayment (as defined in this paragraph), gave its consent to (a) the Company’s execution,
delivery and performance of the Merger (as defined in this paragraph) transaction documents and (b) the Company completing the contemplated
merger (the “Merger”) of MEOA Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition
Inc. (“MEOA”), with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving company in the merger and, after giving effect
to such merger, the Company being a wholly-owned subsidiary of MEOA.
Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, Post Road gave its consent to
the transactions previously disclosed in November 2022, December 2022 and February 2023 (See Note 2) whereby the Company obtained
convertible loans in the aggregate Net Unpaid Principal Amount (as defined in this paragraph) of approximately $2,848,525, and gave its
consent to the Company obtaining additional convertible financing in a Net Unpaid Principal Amount of up to approximately $151,475 pursuant
to similar transaction documents, and for a total Net Unpaid Principal Amount in convertible loans of up to $3,000,000 (such bridge loans
are hereinafter referred to individually as a “Bridge Loan” and collectively as the “Bridge Loans”). Post Road’s
consents to the Bridge Loans in a Net Unpaid Principal Amount of up to $3,000,000 are contingent on (a) the closing of the Merger and
(b) the repayment in full of all obligations under the Bridge Loans from (i) conversion into shares of the Company’s common stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) immediately after the closing of the Merger via cash, or (ii) with Post Road’s
prior written approval, either (A) proceeds of an additional equity offering or financing transaction, or (B) via amortization payments
(collectively, the “Bridge Loan Repayment”) . As used herein, the term “Net Unpaid Principal Amount” means the
principal dollar amount of a Bridge Loan, less the original issue discount (if any) and less the transaction costs paid in cash by the
Company upon the closing thereof.
The Fourth Amendment
amends the Credit Agreement to add defined terms related to the Merger and the Bridge Loans. The Fourth Amendment also adds a default
under the Bridge Loans transaction documents as an event of default pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendments amends the
mandatory prepayment provision to require that, concurrently with each payment made on the Bridge Loans, an amount equal to
50 % of the
total dollar amount of such Bridge Loan payment must be made to partially repay the Notes.
The Fourth Amendment
requires T3 to notify Post Road promptly of any contemplated financings or other offers to lend money that are issued to the Company.
The Fourth Amendment also requires T3 to deliver to Post Road: (a) the full details of any proposed amendment, modification, supplement
or waiver to the Bridge Loan transaction documents before any such document is executed; and (b) notice of the conversion of Bridge Loans
into shares of Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company.
31
The Fourth Amendment
revises each of the six financial covenants set forth in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement (related to maximum leverage, minimum
liquidity, minimum EBITDA, maximum capital expenditures, minimum interest coverage (a provision that replaces the minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio provision), and maximum churn). In addition, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, none of the financial covenants contained
in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Fourth Amendment, other than minimum liquidity of $ 1,000,000 , which was tested
and met as of January 31, 2023. The Fourth Amendment provides that these revised financial covenants will be null and void if the Merger
does not close by February 28, 2023 (the “Merger Outside Closing Date”), in which case the financial covenants in effect
under Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment shall apply and be deemed effective.
Pursuant to the Fourth
Amendment, Post Road agreed to waive each and all of the Specified Defaults (as defined in the Fourth Amendment). Post Road’s waiver
of
the Specified Defaults are contingent on the Merger closing on or before the Merger Outside Closing Date and no events of default
(other than the Specified Defaults) or any condition or event that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute
an event of default, existing under the Credit Agreement on the Merger closing date.
In addition, the Credit
Agreement permits T3 to defer until the respective maturity dates of the Notes the payment of accrued and unpaid interest otherwise due
and payable. The Fourth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement and the Notes to revise the interest rate payable by T3 Nevada including
pursuant to the deferral of the interest payments.
In consideration of
the Fourth Amendment, and in addition to the payments of principal and interest required under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, the Loan Parties covenant and agree to pay to Post Road Administrative, LLC a non-refundable amendment fee equal to $ 400,000
(the “ Amendment Fee ”), which Amendment Fee shall be additional interest that has accrued on, and shall be capitalized
and added to the aggregate principal amount of, the Term Loan C outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment Closing Date.
On March 13, 2023, the
Company, the T3 Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into the Fifth Amendment to its Credit Agreement, with an effective date of February
28, 2023, which specifically revises the Merger Outside Closing Date, replacing the “February
28, 2023” date with “April 28, 2023,” without amending, supplementing or otherwise modifying any other terms, or any
of the conditions, set forth in the Credit Agreement.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. “Forward-looking statements” are those statements that describe management’s
beliefs and expectations about the future. We have identified forward-looking statements by using words such as “anticipate,”
“believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “may,” “expect,” “plan,” and
“intend.” Although we believe these expectations are reasonable, our operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
Some of these risks include the availability and capacity of competitive data transmission networks and our ability to raise sufficient
capital to continue operations. Additional risks are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022,
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 31, 2022.
The following Is a discussion of the unaudited
interim consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Digerati for the three months and six months ended January 31,
2023 and 2022. It should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes thereto, and the other
financial information included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 31, 2022. For purposes of the following discussion, fiscal 2023 or 2023 refers to the
year that will end on July 31, 2023, and fiscal 2022 or 2022 refers to the year ended July 31, 2022.
Overview
Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation
(including our subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “Company” or “Digerati”), through its operating
subsidiaries in Texas, Florida, and California that includes Verve Cloud, Inc., dba, T3 Communications (a Texas entity), T3 Communications,
Inc. (a Florida entity), Nexogy Inc. (a Florida entity), and NextLevel Internet, Inc. (a California entity) (“Next Level”),
provides cloud services specializing in Unified Communications as a Service (“uCaaS”) and broadband connectivity solutions
for the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our
cloud application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband,
and cloud WAN solutions (SD WAN). We provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the small-to-medium-sized business (“SMB”)
at cost-effective monthly rates. Our uCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted IP/PBX, video conferencing, mobile applications,
Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) transport, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud™.
Our broadband connectivity solutions for the delivery of digital oxygen are designed for reliability, business continuity and to optimize
bandwidth for businesses using the Company’s cloud communication services and other cloud-based applications.
As a provider of cloud communications solutions
to the SMB, we are seeking to capitalize on the migration by businesses from the legacy telephone network to the Internet Protocol (“IP”)
telecommunication network and the migration from hardware-based on-premise telephone systems to software-based communication systems
in the cloud. Most SMBs are lagging in technical capabilities and advancement and seldom reach the economies of scale that their larger
counterparts enjoy, due to their achievement of a critical mass and ability to deploy a single solution to a large number of workers.
SMBs are typically unable to afford comprehensive enterprise solutions and, therefore, need to integrate a combination of business solutions
to meet their needs. Cloud computing has revolutionized the industry and opened the door for businesses of all sizes to gain access to
enterprise applications with affordable pricing. This especially holds true for cloud telephony applications, but SMBs are still a higher-touch
sale that requires customer support for system integration, network installation, cabling, and troubleshooting. We have placed a significant
emphasis on that “local” touch when selling, delivering, and supporting our services which we believe will differentiate
us from the national providers that are experiencing high attrition rates due to poor customer support.
The adoption of cloud communication services
is being driven by the convergence of several market trends, IdinI the increasing costs of maintaining installed legacy communications
systems, the fragmentation resulting from use of multiple on-premise systems, and the proliferation of personal smartphones used in the
workplace. Today, businesses are increasingly looking for an affordable path to modernizing their communications system to improve productivity,
business performance and customer experience. Modernization has also led to businesses adopting other cloud-based business applications,
including CRM, payroll, and accounting software, placing an even more important emphasis on reliable Internet connectivity.
Our cloud solutions offer the SMB reliable, robust,
and full-featured services at affordable monthly rates that eliminates high-cost capital expenditures and provides for integration with
other cloud-based systems. By providing a variety of comprehensive and scalable solutions, we can cater to businesses of different sizes
on a monthly subscription basis, regardless of the stage of development for the business.

Recent Developments
MEOA Business Combination
On August 30, 2022, the Company entered into
a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Business Combination
Agreement”), by and among Digerati, Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MEOA”),
and MEOA Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MEOA (“Merger Sub”).
The Business Combination Agreement provides,
among other things, that Merger Sub will merge with and into Digerati, with Digerati as the surviving company in the merger and, after
giving effect to such merger, Digerati shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of MEOA (the “Merger”). In addition, following
the consummation of the Merger, MEOA will be renamed Verve Technologies Corporation.
As previously disclosed, in November and December
2022, Digerati issued the following securities to four (4) bridge lenders including Mast Hill Fund, L.P. (the “Bridge Lenders”):
(a) unsecured promissory notes that are convertible into shares of Digerati’s common stock under certain circumstances; and (b)
warrants to purchase shares of Digerati’s common stock. As used herein, “Bridge Loan Warrants” means those certain
warrants to purchase up to 13,534,535 shares of Digerati’s common stock that Digerati issued to the Bridge Lenders.
As used herein, “New Digerati” refers
to MEOA following the consummation of the Business Combination and “New Digerati Common Stock” means the common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of New Digerati.
On February 14, 2023, the parties to the Business
Combination Agreement amended the Business Combination Agreement (the “February Amendment”) to increase the implied equity
value of Digerati from $68,680,807 to $71,080,810 to give effect to the issuance by Digerati to Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”),
immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, of such number of shares of Digerati’s common stock as would be exchanged
for an aggregate of 240,000 shares of New Digerati Common Stock upon the closing of the Business Combination as partial compensation
for financial advisory services that Maxim provided to Digerati in connection with the Business Combination. The February Amendment also
clarified that the shares of Digerati common stock underlying the Bridge Loan Warrants would not be part of the calculation of the implied
equity value of Digerati of $71,080,810, and it clarified that none of the shares underlying any of the convertible promissory notes
of Digerati that are outstanding upon the closing of the Business Combination are part of the calculation of the implied equity value
of Digerati of $71,080,810.
In connection with the Business Combination,
MEOA has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) the preliminary registration statement on Form S-4,
as amended through the date hereof, containing the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Business Combination Agreement and
the Merger (the “Registration Statement”). Digerati will mail a definitive proxy statement/final prospectus and other relevant
documents to its stockholders.
34
On
February 24, 2023, the Company and MEOA amended its Business Combination Agreement (amendment #2), among other things, amended the following:
● Section
7.1(d) eliminates the date of “February 25, 2023” as the termination date and
replaces it with a termination date of “April 28, 2023.”
● The
Company waives the requirement set forth in Section 5.7 of the Business Combination Agreement
that MEOA have filed the Registration Statement on Form S-4 no later than 45 days following
the date of the Business Combination Agreement, and acknowledges that the aforementioned
Registration Statement was subsequently filed on November 30, 2022.
● MEOA
waives the following:
● the
requirement set forth in Section 5.17 of the Business Combination Agreement that the Company have delivered, by no later than September
15, 2022, certain audited and unaudited financial statements, and acknowledges that the aforementioned financial statements for its fiscal
year ending July 31, 2022 were delivered on October 31, 2022
● the
requirement set forth in Section 5.22 of the Business Combination Agreement that the Company shall have caused Post Road Administrative
LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund II LLP (collectively, “Post Road”), on or prior to October 15, 2022,
to enter into the PRG Resolution Agreement, and acknowledges delivery of the executed PRG Resolution Agreement on February 7, 2023.
Key
Performance indicators:
EBITDA
from operations, as adjusted is a n on-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income
(loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect
cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as corporate expenses, transactional legal expenses, stock option expense,
and depreciation and amortization, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. The Company
believes that the presentation of EBITDA from operations, as adjusted provides useful information regarding the Company’s operations
and other factors that affect the Company’s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time
or non-cash items such as transactional legal fees and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods
caused by factors such as financing and capital structures, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with
insight into both its operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are
not representative of its operations. As a result, users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are better able to
evaluate changes in the financial consolidated results of the Company across different periods.

Three Months ended January 31, 2023 as Compared
to the Three Months ended January 31, 2022.
Cloud software and service revenue increased by
$3,922,000, or 98%, from the three months ended January 31, 2022 as compared to the three months January 31, 2023. In addition, our gross
margin increased by $2,507,000 from the three months ended January 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. The
increase in revenue and gross margin between years is primarily attributed to the increase in total customers between periods due to the
acquisitions of Skynet Telecom LLC (“Skynet”) and Next Level.
EBITDA from operations, as adjusted, increased
from $592,000 from the three months ended January 31, 2022 to $1,204,000 for the three month ended January 31, 2023. The primary reason
for the improvement in EBITDA from operations is due to the increase in gross margin of $2,507,000 between the three months ended January
31, 2022 and 2023. The improvement in gross margin was offset by the increase in total operational expenses of $2,753,000 (net of cost
of services) between the three months ended January 31, 2022 and 2023.
Six Months ended January 31, 2023 as Compared

Cloud
software and service revenue increased by $8,275,000, or 106%, from the six months ended January 31, 2022 as
compared to the six months January 31, 2023 In addition, our gross margin increased by $5,498,000 from the six months ended January 31,
2022 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2023. The increase in revenue and gross margin between years is primarily attributed
to the increase in total customers between periods due to the acquisitions of Skynet Telecom LLC (“Skynet”) and Next Level.
EBITDA from operations, as adjusted, increased
from $1,268,000 from the six months ended January 31, 2022 to $2,594,000   for the six month ended January 31, 2023. The primary
reason for the improvement in EBITDA from operations is due to the increase in gross margin of $5,498,000 between the six months ended
January 31, 2022 and 2023. The improvement in gross margin was offset by the increase in total operational expenses of $5,564,000 (net
of cost of services) between the six months ended January 31, 2022 and 2023.
EBITDA from operations, as adjusted is not intended
to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor have they been presented as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator
of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Our total customers increased from 2,960 at January
31, 2022 as compared to 4,464 at January 31, 2023. The increase in customers is attributed to the acquisitions and consolidation of Skynet

of customers of 1% to 5% each fiscal year.

the six months ended January 31, 2023 as a result of operating expenses, that included $46,000 in stock compensation and warrant expense,
bad debt expense of $69,000, amortization of right-of-use assets for $546,000, gain on settlement of conversion premium for $466,000,
amortization of debt discount of $850,000, gain on derivative liability of $773,000, depreciation and amortization expense of $1,919,000,
debt extension fee charged to interest expense for $418,000, and common stock issued for debt extension charged to interest expense for
$340,000. The change in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net increase of $298,000.
Cash used in investing activities during the
six months ended January 31, 2023, was $264,000, which was used for the acquisition of equipment.
Cash
provided by financing activities during the six months ended January 31, 2023, was $2,960,000. The net increase in cash provided by financing
was primarily due to the Company securing $3,990,000 from convertible notes, net of issuance costs and discounts and securing $250,000
from debt financing from a related party, net of issuance costs and discounts, proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $22,000, offset
by principal payments of $500,000 on various convertible notes, principal payments of $250,000 on debt, principal payments on related
party notes of $499,000, and $53,000 in principal payments on equipment financing.
Overall, our net operating, investing, and financing
activities during the six months ended January 31, 2023, resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for $694,000.
Digerati’s consolidated financial statements
for the six months ended January 31, 2023, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the Company’s inception in 1993, Digerati has incurred
net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $118,153,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $40,765,000 which raises
doubt about Digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We are currently taking initiatives to reduce
our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During fiscal 2023 certain members of our management team will continue to receive
a portion of their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash. To strengthen our business, we intend
to adopt best practices from or recent acquisitions and invest in a marketing and sales strategy to grow our monthly recurring revenue;
we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers and channel partners to tap into new sources of revenue streams; and we have also secured
numerous agent agreements through our recent acquisitions that we anticipate will accelerate revenue growth. In addition, we will continue
to focus on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort to increase our revenues,
we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. As a
result, during the due diligence process we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional fees.
Our cash requirements to meet our interest payments
to Post Road, capital expenditure needs, and operational cash flow needs over the next 18 months are estimated to be approximability
$3,500,000. The Company anticipates issuing additional equity or entered into additional Convertible Notes to secure the funding required
meet these cash needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable
terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to meet its interest payments, capital
expenditures and operational needs. As a result, the Company will be required to negotiate with its lender the terms of the current financing
agreements, in addition to postponing the timing of deployment of its capital expenditures and extending the timing of the operational
cash needs.

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations,
warranties, and indemnification provisions. The Credit Agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants with respect to operation
of the business and properties of the loan parties as well as financial performance. Below are key covenants requirements, (measured
quarterly) ) beginning with the quarter ended April 30,
2023:
● Maximum–Allowed
- Senior Leverage Ratio of 6.18 to 1.00
●
Minimum–Allowed -
EBITDA of $4,565,009
●
Minimum–Allowed -
Liquidity of $2,000,000
●
Maximum–Allowed -
Capital Expenditures of $175,000
(Quarterly)
●
Minimum–Allowed -
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.00 to 1.00
●
Maximum–Allowed -
Churn of 3.00% at any time
On December 15, 2022, the lender agreed to forbear
from exercising its remedies in connection with the financial covenants that were not complied with during the quarter ended October
31,2022, as well as certain other specified defaults, until December 23, 2022 or such later date as agreed to in writing by the lender.
On February 3, 2023,
the Company, the T3 Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and Amendment to Notes (the
“Fourth Amendment”). Among other things, the Fourth Amendment revises each of the six financial covenants set forth in Section
11.12 of the Credit Agreement (related to maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, minimum EBITDA, maximum capital expenditures, minimum
interest coverage (a provision that replaces the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio provision), and maximum churn). In addition, pursuant
to the Fourth Amendment, none of the financial covenants contained in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Fourth
Amendment, other than minimum liquidity will be tested with respect to the fiscal quarter that ended on January 31, 2023. The Fourth
Amendment provides that these revised financial covenants will be null and void if the Merger does not close by February 28, 2023 (the
“Merger Outside Closing Date”), in which case the financial covenants in effect under Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement
immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment shall apply and be deemed effective.
Pursuant to the Fourth
Amendment, Post Road agreed to waive each and all of the Specified Defaults (as defined in the Fourth Amendment). Post Road’s waiver
of the Specified Defaults are contingent on the Merger closing on or before the Merger Outside Closing Date and no events of default
(other than the Specified Defaults) or any condition or event that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute
an event of default, existing under the Credit Agreement on the Merger closing date.
On March 13, 2023, the
Company, the T3 Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into the Fifth Amendment to its Credit Agreement, with an effective date of February
28, 2023, which specifically revises the Merger Outside Closing Date, replacing the “February
28, 2023” date with “April 28, 2023,” without amending, supplementing or otherwise modifying any other terms, or any
of the conditions, set forth in the Credit Agreement.
In addition, the Credit
Agreement permits T3 to defer until the respective maturity dates of the Notes the payment of accrued and unpaid interest otherwise due
and payable. The Fourth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement and the Notes to revise the interest rate payable by T3 including pursuant
to the deferral of the interest payments.
While Digerati, the parent company of T3, is
not subject to these financial covenants, they have had and will continue to have a material impact on T3’s expenditures and ability
to raise funds.
While Digerati, the parent company of T3, is
not subject to these financial covenants, they have had and will continue to have a material impact on T3 Nevada’s expenditures
and ability to raise funds.
In addition, our Term Loan C Note with Post Road
with a maturity date of August 4, 2023, requires a full principal payment (currently $10,000,000) and accrued interest by the maturity
date. We will work with our equity partners to secure additional financings to meet this obligation by the maturity date. In addition,
we will work with our lender on the current terms to the Term Loan C Note, to extend the maturity date or restructure the terms of the
note. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms to meet the
cash payment requirements on the Term Loan C Note. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure the terms
or extend the maturity date of the Term Loan C Note with Post Road. If the Company is not able to restructure the financing or repay
the Term Loan C Note by the August 4 th
maturity date and Post Road declares an event of default, it would have a material
adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including the possibility of Post Road foreclosing on some or all of our assets.
We
have been successful in raising debt and equity capital in the past and as described in Notes 6, 7, 8, and 12. We have financing efforts
in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings. On November 28, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase
agreement (the “SPA”) with Mast Hill Fund, L.P. (the “Investor”). Pursuant to the SPA, the Investor purchased,
and the Company issued, an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”) in the aggregate principal amount totaling approximately
$1,670,000 (the “Principal Amount”) with an original issue discount of $250,500. The gross proceeds the Company received
prior to payment of transaction expenses was $1,419,500. (See Note 12)
Although
we have successfully completed financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters
in the future will be successful.
42
The current Credit Agreement with Post Road will
allow the Company to continue acquiring UCaaS service providers that meet the Company’s acquisition criteria. Management anticipates
that future acquisitions will provide additional operating revenues to the Company as it continues to execute on its consolidation strategy.
There can be no guarantee that the planned acquisitions will close or that they will produce the anticipated revenues on the schedule
anticipated by management.
The Company will continue to work with various funding sources to
secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the
aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.
Management believes that available resources
as of January 31, 2023, will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, debt service and corporate expenses over the next
12 months. The Company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon,
and other things, raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team in
lieu of cash, or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company
will seek to secure such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales of assets, or
collaborative arrangements. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible
into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of
the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject
to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements
with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain
financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail its operations,
and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.
Our current cash expenses are expected to be
approximately $1,300,000 per month, including wages, rent, utilities, corporate expenses, and legal professional fees associated with
potential acquisitions. As described elsewhere herein, we are not generating sufficient cash from operations to pay for our corporate
and ongoing operating expenses, or to pay our current liabilities. As of January 31, 2023, our total liabilities were approximately $69,201,000,
which included $9,879,000 in derivative liabilities. We will continue to use our available cash on hand to cover our deficiencies in
operating expenses.
Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.
Not Applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
In connection with the preparation of this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2023, our Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”) and Principal Financial
Officer (“PFO”) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on that evaluation, our PEO and PFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report were not effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the
Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms
and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system
are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
a company have been detected.
(b) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, during our most recently
completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting, as there has been no implementation to date of processes and/or procedures to remedy internal control weaknesses and deficiencies.

Item 5. Other Information.
We
are reporting the following information in lieu of reporting on a Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 1.01 1 Entry into a Material Definitive
Agreement.
As previously disclosed, on
August 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from
time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among Digerati, Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (“MEOA”), and MEOA Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MEOA (“Merger
Sub”).
The Business Combination Agreement
provides, among other things, that Merger Sub will merge with and into Digerati, with Digerati as the surviving company in the merger
and, after giving effect to such merger, Digerati shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of MEOA (the “Merger”). In addition,
following the consummation of the Merger, MEOA will be renamed Verve Technologies Corporation.
As
previously disclosed, in November 2020, the Company and T3 Communications, Inc. and T3’s subsidiaries (T3 and its subsidiaries,
collectively, “the T3 Nevada Parties”) entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Post Road
Administrative LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund II LLP (collectively, “Post Road”). The Company is
a party to certain sections of the Credit Agreement. Next Level Internet, Inc. became a T3 Nevada Party in February 2022.
As
previously disclosed, on February 3, 2023, the Company, the T3 Nevada Parties, and Post Road entered into a Consent, Limited Waiver and
Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Amendment to Notes (the “Fourth Amendment”). Among other things, pursuant to the
Fourth Amendment, Post Road agreed to waive each and all of the Specified Defaults (as defined in the Fourth Amendment). Post Road’s
waiver of the Specified Defaults were contingent on the Merger closing on or before February 28, 2023 (the “Merger Outside Closing
Date”) and no events of default (other than the Specified Defaults) or any condition or event that, with the giving of notice or
the lapse of time or both, would constitute an event of default, existing under the Credit Agreement on the Merger closing date.

date of February 28, 2023 (the “Fifth Amendment”), which specifically revises the Merger Outside Closing Date, replacing the
