SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
AND
OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Form 10-Q”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give
our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. You can find many (but not all) of these statements by looking for words such as “approximates,”
“believes,” “hopes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “projects,”
“intends,” “plans,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may” or other
similar expressions in this Form 10-Q. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions; prospective products, applications,
customers and technologies; future performance or results of anticipated products; anticipated expenses; and projected financial results.
These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:
●
our
ability to continue as a going concern;
●
our
operating expenses exceed our revenues and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future;
●
our
ability to obtain additional capital, which may be difficult to raise as a result of our limited operating history or any number
of other reasons;
●
competition;
●
general
economic conditions and events and the impact they may have on us; and
●
other
factors discussed in this Form 10-Q.
We
may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place
undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations
disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this
Form 10-Q that we believe could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make.
Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures
or investments we may make or collaborations or strategic partnerships we may enter into.
You
should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we have filed as exhibits to this Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that
our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
Unless
otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “Worldwide NFT Inc.” “we,” “us,” “our”
and the “Company” refer collectively to Worldwide NFT Inc. and its subsidiaries.

NOTE
5 –
GOING CONCERN
The
Company concluded that due to the change in management and revival of the entity, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued.
Management
intends to identify potential merger candidates to provide operating revenues and profitability. Our ability to effectively identify,
develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control, including
without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and global economies. Even though management
believes this plan will allow the Company to continue as a going concern, there are no guarantees to the successful execution of this
plan.
These
financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable
period of time.
Impact
of COVID-19
The
COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company, particularly due to our lack of operations.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The
Company received a notice of appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court filed May 17, 2022 by Warwick Calasse. Mr. Calasse is appealing the decision
by the District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County (In the Matter of GOFF Corp., Case No. A-20-815182-B) by an Order

50,000,000

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Corporate
Information
We
were incorporated on July 12, 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name Goff Corp. We were never able to raise sufficient
capital to engage in the business of providing web-based services to connect employers in and individuals seeking employment in the UK
and Ireland. On February 26, 2013 our two founding officers and directors resigned and were replaced by Warwick Calasse who assumed the
title of President, CEO, CFO, Secretary, Treasurer and sole member of our Board of Directors. We disclosed that on January 1, 2013 that
we had entered into an Assignment Agreement with dated January 21, 2013 between Golden Glory Panama, as assignee, and Sertesaz Ltd. and
C&ENER SA, the Colombian owners that owned 60% and 40% of the concession in return for shares of our common stock and cash payments
through March 7, 2016 of over $3,000.000 comprised of payments for the option to purchase 100% of the mining concessions and mining development
expenditures.
On
May 26, 2021, George Sharp was appointed as our Custodian by Order Granting Motion to (1) Intervene, (2) Remove Custodian, (3) Appoint
George Sharp as Custodian, and (4) for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction on Order Shortening Time, Case No A-20-815182-B,
Dept. No. XVI issued by the District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County (the “Court Order”). Under his
authority as Custodian, George Sharp appointed himself as the sole member of the Board and President, Secretary and Treasurer of the
Company by resolutions of the registrant’s Board of Directors on May 26, 2021.
There
had been no common or preferred stock transactions since 2013 until August 29, 2021 when the Company issued 300,000 shares of the authorized
“blank check” preferred stock to George Sharp with 30,000 common votes for each share of preferred stock.
On
January 19, 2022, the Company registered with the Secretary of State in Nevada to change their name to Worldwide NFT Inc. FINRA approved
the name change, and a forward 3 for 1 stock split of the common shares on June 29, 2022. All common shares have been restated retroactively
in accordance with SAB Topic 4C.
The
preferred shares convert to common at a ratio of 1 share of preferred stock converting to 90 shares of common stock.
On
November 23, 2021, our Form 10 became effective, and the Company became a reporting company.
The
Company is in process of identifying potential acquisition targets. There have been no definitive agreements executed as of the date
of this report.
Our
principal executive offices are located at 3535 Executive Terminal Drive, Henderson, NV 89052, and our telephone number is (702)-840-4433.
The
Company’s accounting year end is June 30.
Our
principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination
with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific
business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business or be acquired should such a reasonable opportunity
arise.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related
notes. These estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on our financial statements. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates.
Critical
accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, we do not believe that there are any alternative methods of accounting for our
operations that would have a material effect on our financial statements.
Coronavirus
Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act
The
COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company, particularly due to our lack of operations. The pandemic may, however,
have an impact on our ability to develop business. For example, our efforts will be threatened by government shutdowns, supply and labor
issues and resulting economic downturns which the pandemic has historically caused. While vaccinations beginning in 2021 allowed for
the partial reopening of the economy, the recent “Omicron” variant of the virus, as well as reduced efficacy of vaccines
over time and the possibility that a large number of people decline to get vaccinated or receive booster shots, creates inherent uncertainty
as to the future of our business, the industries in which we operate and plan to operate and the economy in general in light of the pandemic.

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements
As
of the date of this Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Going
Concern
The
independent registered public accounting firm auditors’ report accompanying our June 30, 2022 financial statements contained an
explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been
prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy
our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
Results
of Operations
We
expect that our operating revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses will greatly increase in the next fiscal year when we identify
a potential acquisition target. Currently we only have nominal operating expenses to run the company and report to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. We have identified ourselves as a shell company until such time a suitable business can be acquired, and we sustain
operations.
For
the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
In
the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred professional fees of $69,539 and $20,014,352, respectively. In 2021 $19,930,300
of the professional fees were the result of shares issued to our CEO, which is a non-cash expense. These costs mostly relate to the filing
of the required Securities and Exchange reports as well as costs to bring current the Company with required state regulatory filings.
For
the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
In
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred professional fees of $33,131 and $19,890,000, respectively. In 2021 $19,890,000
of the professional fees were the result of shares issued to our CEO, which is a non-cash expense. These costs mostly relate to the filing
of the required Securities and Exchange reports as well as costs to bring current the Company with required state regulatory filings.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
Company in May 2021 was recently revived by the State of Nevada. The Company had no operations for a period of five years prior to that
when they filed a Form 15.
On
May 26, 2021, George Sharp was appointed as our Custodian by Order Granting Motion to (1) Intervene, (2) Remove Custodian, (3) Appoint
George Sharp as Custodian, and (4) for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction on Order Shortening Time, Case No A-20-815182-B,
Dept. No. XVI issued by the District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County (the “Court Order”). Under his
authority as Custodian, George Sharp appointed himself as the sole member of the Board and President, Secretary and Treasurer of the
Company by resolutions of the registrant’s Board of Directors on May 26, 2021.
Since
May 26, 2021, the Company has completed Securities and Exchange Commission filings to become a fully reporting company. They have brought
current state regulatory filings to be compliant in the State of Nevada. The Company has commenced the process to identify suitable acquisition
targets. The current operating expenses incurred have been to get to this point. Future operating expenses will be largely funded by
George Sharp until such time as the Company can raise the necessary funding to acquire a business and provide necessary working capital
to pay for the operating expenses of the Company.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $20,913,751 and a working capital deficit of $246,701. Our independent registered
public accounting firm has provided a going concern opinion on our most recent audited financial statements as of June 30, 2022.
In
the future, we will need to consummate one or more capital raising transactions, including potential debt or equity issuances, and/or
generate material revenue from an acquired business or businesses to fund our operations. We may also issue shares of common stock, stock
options or other securities to compensate our employees or independent contractors.
Net
Cash used by Operating Activities :
We
reported negative cash flow from operations related to our continuing operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
in the amount of $0 and $(50,000), respectively. It is anticipated that we will continue to report negative operating cash flow in future
periods. In 2021, the net loss was offset by the non-cash charge for the shares issued to our CEO.
Cash
Flows from Investing Activities:
We
had no investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Cash
Flows from Financing Activities :
For
the six months ended December 31, 2021, the only cash flows from financing activities related to the proceeds from the CEO related to
the purchase of preferred shares. There were no financing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents
Based
upon our current operations, we will need additional working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. Further, if we are
able to close a reverse merger, asset purchase or similar transaction to acquire an operating business, it is likely we will need additional
capital, including potentially as a condition of closing the acquisition. Because of the inherent uncertainties of the Company at this
stage, we cannot be certain as to how much capital we need, if and how we can raise capital or the type or quantity of securities we
will be required to issue to do so. In connection with a business combination, we may issue a significant number our shares of our common
stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock to the target’s shareholders which will be dilutive to our
shareholders.
We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses during the next 12 months. Our ability to develop and implement our business plan will
be subject to a number of risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development. Such
risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model; recognition of revenue sources; and the management
of growth.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company,” as defined
in Rule 229.10(f)(1).
Item
4. Controls and Procedures Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
The
term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact there are resource constraints and management is required to apply judgment
in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the
period covered by this Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) has occurred
during the period ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
