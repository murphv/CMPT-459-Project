RESOURCES CONNECTION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. Description of the Company and its Business
Resources Connection, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on November 16, 1998. The Company’s operating entities provide services primarily under the name Resources Global Professionals (“RGP”). RGP is a global consulting firm focused on project execution services that power clients’ operational needs and change initiatives utilizing on-demand, experienced and diverse talent. As a next-generation human capital partner for its clients, the Company specializes in co-delivery of enterprise initiatives typically precipitated by business transformation, strategic transactions or regulatory change. The Company’s principal markets of operations are North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
The Company’s fiscal year consists of
52
or
53  weeks, ending on the
Saturday in May closest to May 31 . The second quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022 each consisted of
13
weeks. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 will consist of
52
weeks.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company as of and for the three and six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021 have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. These financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) the Company’s management considers necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position at such dates and the operating results and cash flows for those periods.
The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although management believes these estimates and assumptions are adequate, actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
The fiscal 2022 year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, and certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules or regulations; however, the Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 28, 2022, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K”) filed with the SEC on July 28, 2022 (File No. 0-32113).
A complete listing of the Company’s significant accounting policies is discussed in Note 2 –

Reporting Segments
On May 31, 2022, the Company divested
taskforce
– Management on Demand GmbH, and its wholly owned subsidiary skillforce – Executive Search GmbH,
a German professional services firm operating under the
taskforce
brand (“ taskforce”) ; see Note 4 –
Dispositions
for further information.
Since the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and prior to the divestment, the business operated by
taskforce , along with its parent company,
Resources Global Professionals (Germany) GmbH (“RGP Germany”), an affiliate of the Company,
represented an operating segment of the Company and was reported as a part of Other Segments.
9
Effective May 31, 2022, the Company’s operating segments
consist of the following:
 RGP – a global consulting firm focused on project execution services that power clients’ operational needs and change initiatives utilizing on-demand, experienced and diverse talent; and  Sitrick – a crisis communications and public relations firm which operates under the Sitrick brand, providing corporate, financial, transactional and crisis communication and management services.
Each of these segments reports through a separate management team to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is designated as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for segment reporting purposes. RGP is the Company’s only operating segment that meets the quantitative threshold of a reportable segment. Sitrick does not individually meet the quantitative threshold to qualify as a reportable segment. Therefore, Sitrick is disclosed in Other Segments. Each of these segments represents a reporting unit for the purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment.
Prior-period comparative segment information was not restated as a result of the divestiture of
taskforce
as the Company did not have a change in internal organization or the financial information that the
CODM uses to assess performance and allocate resources. See Note 13 –
Segment Information and Enterprise Reporting
for further information.
Per Share Information
The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.
The following table summarizes the calculation of net income per common share for the three and six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Financial Instruments
The fair value of the Company’s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates it will receive in connection with the sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
The Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses and long-term debt are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short - term maturity of these instruments or because their stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates.
Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale
Assets and liabilities held for sale represent primarily cash, accounts receivable, goodwill and other assets and liabilities that met the criteria of “held for sale” accounting, as specified by Accounting Standards Codification 360,
Property, Plant, and Equipment . The effect of suspending amortization on noncurrent assets held for sale was immaterial to the Company’s results of operations.
10
The Company records assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value was based on the estimated proceeds from the sale of the business utilizing the purchase price as defined in the agreement. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset or disposal group until the date of sale.
As of May 28, 2022, the Company classified certain assets and liabilities as held for sale in connection with the sale of
taskforce , which closed on May 31, 2022. See Note 4 –
Dispositions
for further information.
Capitalized Hosting Arrangements
The capitalized hosting arrangements costs are primarily related to the implementation of a cloud-based enterprise resource planning system and talent acquisition and management system. Such costs include third party implementation costs and costs associated with internal resources directly involved in the implementation. Capitalized hosting arrangements are stated at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of the expected term of the hosting arrangement, taking into consideration several other factors such as, but not limited to, options to extend the hosting arrangement or options to terminate the hosting arrangement. The amortization of capitalized implementation costs for hosting arrangements will commence when the systems are ready for their intended use and will be presented as operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations consistent with the presentation for expensing the fees for the associated hosting arrangement.
As of November 26, 2022, the capitalized costs related to hosting arrangements incurred during the application development stage were $ 1.0
million. These capitalized hosting arrangements are included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet and
no
costs were amortized. There were
no
capitalized costs recorded as of May 28, 2022.
Stock Repurchases and Retirement
The Company’s stock repurchase program provides an opportunity for the Company to repurchase shares at the discretion of the Company’s senior executives based on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, and other demands for cash. The Company recognizes treasury stock based on the amount paid to repurchase its shares. Direct costs incurred to acquire treasury stock are treated like stock issue costs and added to the cost of the treasury stock.
The Company accounts for the retirement of repurchased shares using the par value method under which the cost of repurchased and retired shares in excess of the par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.
When the repurchase price is greater than the original issue proceeds, the excess is charged to retained earnings. The Company uses the weighted-average cost flow assumption to identify and assign the original issue proceeds to the cost of the shares repurchased and retired. The Company believes that this allocation method is preferable because it more accurately reflects its paid-in capital balances by allocating the cost of the shares repurchased and retired to paid-in capital in proportion to paid-in capital associated with the original issuance of those shares.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
No recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements have been issued or adopted that are of material
significance , or have potential material significance, to the Company’s financial statements since those discussed in the Company’s Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K.
3. Revenue Recognition
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections affects the recognition of trade accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities.
Contract assets represent the Company’s rights to consideration for completed performance under the contract (i.e., unbilled receivables), in which the Company has transferred control of the product or services before there is an unconditional right to payment. Contract assets were $ 36.1
million and $ 42.6
million as of November 26, 2022 and May 28, 2022, respectively, which were included in trade accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contract liabilities represent deferred revenue when cash is received in advance of performance of services and are presented in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities were $ 3.4
million and $ 4.2
million as of November 26, 2022 and May 28, 2022, respectively.
Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended November 26, 2022, which were included in deferred revenue as of May 28, 2022 were $ 1.0
million and $ 1.8
million, respectively.

4. Dispositions
Sale of taskforce
On April 21, 2022, RGP Germany entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) to sell its business in
taskforce
to
MoveVision – Management-, Beteiligungs- und Servicegesellschaft mbH and Blue Elephant – Management-, Beteiligungs- und Servicegesellschaft mbH (collectively, the “Purchasers”), owned by the original
founder and a member of the senior leadership team of
taskforce , respectively. The SPA provided for the sale of all of the shares of
taskforce
from
RGP Germany
to the Purchasers for a purchase price of approximately EUR
5.5
million, subject to final working capital adjustments, with
50 % of the consideration to be paid in cash
in connection with the closing and the remaining
50 % payable on July 1, 2024 and bearing interest based on the Company’s average borrowing interest rate plus
285
basis points, compounded annually .
On May 31, 2022 , the Company completed the sale of
taskforce . Upon conclusion of the Final Completion Accounts and Calculation (as defined in the Sale and Purchase Agreement), the final purchase price was determined to be EUR
5.5
million (approximately $ 6.0
million), of which EUR
2.8
million (approximately $ 3.0
million) was received in cash and EUR
2.7
million (approximately $ 3.0
million) shall become due in July 2024 in accordance with the SPA. Such receivable is presented in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company recognized a $ 0.2
million gain on the sale during the six months ended November 26, 2022, which was recorded in other income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
As of May 28, 2022, assets and liabilities of
taskforce
were classified as held for sale in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such assets and liabilities were presented at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. The Company concluded that the agreed-upon transaction price of the business approximated fair value, which exceeded the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities as of May 28, 2022. As such, the assets and liabilities related to the sale were recorded and presented at their carrying value.
The following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 28, 2022 (in thousands):

million in disposal costs related to the sale of
taskforce
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 28, 2022 and recorded an immaterial amount of disposal costs during the
six
months ended November 26, 2022.
The disposition of
taskforce
did not qualify as a discontinued operation because it did not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations or financial results.
12
Other Dispositions
As part of its restructuring effort in Europe which began in fiscal 2021, the Company initiated the wind-down and dissolution of certain entities. During the six months ended November 27, 2021, the Company completed the dissolution of the following
two
foreign subsidiaries: Resources Global Professionals (Denmark) AS and Resources Global Professionals (Italy) SRL, as it continued to complete its exit from certain non-core markets in Europe. The Company recognized a total loss on dissolution of $ 0.1
million during the six months ended November 27, 2021,
primarily related to the recognition of the accumulated translation adjustment associated with these foreign subsidiaries , which was included in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations . None of the markets sold or exited during the first six months of fiscal 2022 represented a strategic shift of the Company’s operations.

7. Long-Term Debt
Prior to November 12, 2021, the Company had a $ 120.0
million secured revolving credit facility (the “Previous Credit Facility”) with Bank of America, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement dated October 17, 2016 between the Company and Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and Bank of America, N.A. as lender (as amended, the “Previous Credit Agreement”). The Previous Credit Agreement was set to mature on
October 17, 2022 .
On November 12, 2021,
the Company and Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors,
entered into a new credit agreement with the lenders that are party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders
(the “New Credit Agreement”), and concurrently terminated the Previous Credit Facility . The New Credit Agreement provides for a $ 175.0
million senior secured revolving loan (the “New Credit Facility”), which includes a $ 10.0
million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a swingline sublimit of $ 20.0
million. The New Credit Facility also includes an option to increase the amount of the revolving loan up to an additional $ 75.0
million , subject to the terms of the New Credit Agreement . The New Credit Facility matures on
November 12, 2026 . The obligations under the New Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Company, Resources Connection LLC and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.
Borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum of either, at the Company’s election, (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from
1.25 % to
2.00 % or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the New Credit Agreement), plus a margin of
0.25 % to
1.00 % with the applicable margin depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, which resulted in an interest rate of
5.16 % and
2.15 % as of November 26, 2022 and May 28, 2022, respectively. The Company pays an unused commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the New Credit Facility, which ranges from
0.20 % to
0.30 % depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio.
The New Credit Agreement contains both affirmative and negative covenants. Covenants include, but are not limited to, limitations on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and make dispositions of assets. In addition, the New Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with financial covenants including limitation on the Company’s total funded debt, minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio. The Company was compliant with all financial covenants under the New Credit Agreement as of November 26, 2022.
As of November 26, 2022 and May 28, 2022, the Company has borrowed $ 20.0
million and $ 54.0
million, respectively, under the New Credit Facility. In addition, the Company had $ 0.8
million of outstanding letters of credit issued as of November 26, 2022 and $ 1.2
million of outstanding letters of credit issued as of May 28, 2022, in each case under the New Credit Facility. As of November 26, 2022, there was $ 154.2
million remaining capacity under the New Credit Facility.
On November 2, 2022, Resources Global Enterprise Consulting (Beijing) Co., Ltd . (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor,
entered into a RMB
13.4
million (USD $ 1.8
million based on the prevailing exchange rate on November 2, 2022) revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. (Beijing) as the lender
(the “Beijing Revolver”).
The Beijing Revolver bears interest at loan prime rate plus
0.80 %. Interest incurred on borrowings will be payable monthly in arrears. As of November 26, 2022, the Company had
no
borrowings outstanding under the Beijing Revolver and RMB
13.4
million (USD $ 1.9
million based on the prevailing exchange rate on November 26, 2022) in availability under the Beijing Revolver. The availability of proceeds under the Beijing Revolver is at the lender's absolute discretion and may be terminated at any time by the lender, with or without prior notice to the borrower.
8. Income Taxes
For the three months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, the Company’s
income tax expense was $ 5.9
million, an effective tax rate of
25.2 %, and $ 5.6
million, an effective tax rate of
28.0 %, respectively.
For the six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, the Company’s income tax expense was $ 12.9
million, an effective tax rate of
26.6 %, and $ 10.8
million, an effective tax rate of
28.3 %, respectively.
The change in effective tax rate resulted largely from higher pre-tax income in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 while permanent book to tax differences were more favorable due to higher income tax benefits associated with the vesting of employee stock awards and interest income associated with an income tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).
The Company operates in an international environment. Accordingly, the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings (losses) in various locations and the applicable tax rates in those jurisdictions, and fluctuations in the consolidated effective tax rate year over year, are due to the changes in the mix of operating income and losses amongst the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given the current earnings and anticipated future earnings of some of the Company’s foreign locations, the Company believes there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow it to reach a conclusion that the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of certain foreign entities will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change depending on the level of profitability that the Company is able to actually achieve.
15
For the three months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $ 1.1
million and $ 0.5
million, respectively, associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options, vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and disqualifying dispositions by employees of shares acquired under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). For the six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $ 1.7
million and $ 0.8
million, respectively, associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options, vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and disqualifying dispositions by employees of shares acquired under the ESPP.
The Company’s total liability for unrecognized gross tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, was $ 0.9
million as of both November 26, 2022 and May 28, 2022, which, if ultimately recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. The unrecognized tax benefits are included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
None
of the unrecognized tax benefits are short-term liabilities as the Company does not anticipate any cash payments within 12 months to settle the liability.
In April 2022, we filed for a federal income tax refund in the amount of $ 34.8
million related to the carry back of the fiscal year 2021 net operating loss to fiscal years 2016 to 2018 and refund of alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credits for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. As of November 26, 2022, we have received a refund of $ 10.3
million (including interest income). In December 2022,
subsequent to the second quarter , we received an additional $ 9.3
million. We expect to receive the remainder of the refund in the earlier part of calendar year 2023; however, there may be unanticipated processing delays that postpone receipt.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law by the United States (“U.S.") government. The IRA includes implementation of a new alternative minimum tax, an excise tax on stock buybacks, and significant tax incentives for energy and climate initiatives, among other provisions. The Company is evaluating the provisions included under the IRA and does not expect the provisions to have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
9. Stockholders’ Equity
Stock
Repurchase Program
The Company’s board of directors has previously approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase, at the discretion of the Company’s senior executives, of the Company’s common stock for a designated aggregate dollar limit. The current program was authorized in July 2015 (the “July 2015 Program”) and set an aggregate dollar limit not to exceed $ 150
million. Subject to the aggregate dollar limit, the currently authorized stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Repurchases under the program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. During the three and six months ended November 26, 2022, the Company purchased
318,438
shares of its common stock on the open market at an average price of $ 16.80
per share, for an aggregate total purchase price of approximately $ 5.4
million. As of November 26, 2022, approximately $ 60.1
million remained available for future repurchases of the Company’s common stock under the July 2015 Program. During the three and six months ended November 27, 2021, the Company made
no
repurchases of its common stock.
Quarterly Dividend
Subject to approval each quarter by its board of directors, the Company pays a regular dividend. On October 20, 2022, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $ 0.14
per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend was paid on December 15, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2022. As of November 26, 2022 and May 28, 2022, $ 4.7
million and $ 4.6
million were accrued and recorded in other current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets for dividends declared but not yet paid. Continuation of the quarterly dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends upon the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business condition, contractual restrictions contained in the New Credit Facility and other agreements, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
Retirement of Treasury Shares
On November 8, 2021, the Company retired
31.7
million shares of its common stock held in treasury. The shares were returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares. As a result, the treasury stock balance decreased by approximated $ 520.7
million. In connection with the retirement, the Company reduced its common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings balances by $ 0.3
million, $ 157.6
million, and $ 362.7
million, respectively. Refer to Note 2 —

10. Restructuring Activities
During calendar year 2020, the Company initiated a global restructuring and business transformation plan in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe (the “Restructuring Plans”). The Restructuring Plans consisted of two key components: (i) an effort to streamline the management and organizational structure and eliminate certain positions as well as exit certain markets to focus on core solution offerings and high-growth clients; and (ii) a strategic rationalization of the Company’s physical geographic footprint and real estate spend to focus investment dollars in high-growth core markets for greater impact. The Company incurred employee termination and facility exit costs associated with the Company’s restructuring initiatives within its RGP segment, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Restructuring Plans were substantially completed in fiscal 2021. Restructuring costs, including real estate exit costs and adjustments to employee termination costs, associated with the restructuring activities were insignificant and $ 0.6
million for the three months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively, and ($ 0.4 ) million and $ 0.7
million for the six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively. Restructuring liability was
zero
and $ 0.4
million as of November 26, 2022 and May 28, 2022, respectively.
11. Stock-Based Compensation Plans
General
The Company’s stockholders approved the Resources Connection, Inc. 2020 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) on October 22, 2020, which replaced and succeeded in its entirety the Resources Connection, Inc. 2014 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). Executive officers and certain employees, as well as non-employee directors of the Company and certain consultants and advisors are eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2020 Plan equals: (1)
1,797,440
(which represents the number of shares that were available for additional award grant purposes under the 2014 Plan immediately prior to the termination of the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan as of October 22, 2020), plus (2) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the 2014 Plan or the Resources Connection, Inc. 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (together with the 2014 Plan, the “Prior Plans”) and outstanding as of October 22, 2020 which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised, plus (3) the number of any shares subject to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under the Prior Plans that are outstanding and unvested as of October 22, 2020 which are forfeited, terminated, cancelled, or otherwise reacquired after that date without having become vested.
Awards under the 2020 Plan may include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in shares of common stock or units of common stock, as well as certain cash bonus awards.
Historically, the Company has granted restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock option awards under the 2020 Plan that typically vest in equal annual installments, and performance stock unit awards under the 2020 Plan that vest upon the achievement of certain Company-wide performance targets at the end of the defined performance period.
Stock option grants typically terminate
ten years
from the date of grant. Vesting periods for restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock option awards range from
three
to
four years .
The performance period for the performance stock unit awards is
three years .
As of November 26, 2022, there were
1,240,042
shares available for further award grants under the 2020 Plan.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was
$ 2.2
million and
$ 2.0
million for the three months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively,
and $ 4.8
million and $ 3.6
million for the six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively . These amounts consisted of stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards under the 2020 Plan and Prior Plans, employee stock purchases made via the ESPP, and stock units credited under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $ 0.3
million and $ 0.5
million associated with such stock - based compensation expense during the three months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively,
and $ 1.0
million and $ 0.8
million during the six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively . The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on time-vesting equity awards ratably over the applicable vesting period based on the grant date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures. Expense related to the liability-classified awards reflects the change in fair value during the reporting period. The number of performance stock units earned at the end of the performance period may equal, exceed or be less than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met. During each reporting period, the Company uses the latest forecasted results to estimate the number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period. Any resulting changes to stock compensation expense are adjusted in the period in which the change in estimates occur.

Overview
Resources Global Professionals (“RGP”) is a global consulting firm focused on project execution services that power clients’ operational needs and change initiatives utilizing on-demand, experienced and diverse talent. As a next-generation human capital partner for our clients, we specialize in co-delivery of enterprise initiatives typically precipitated by business transformation, strategic transactions or regulatory change. Our engagements are designed to leverage human connection and collaboration to deliver practical solutions and more impactful results that power our clients’, consultants’ and partners’ success.
21
A disruptor within the professional services industry since our founding in 1996,
today the Company enjoys a favorable macro environment that embraces its differentiated agile delivery model. The trends in today’s marketplace favor the flexibility and agility that RGP provides as businesses confront transformation pressures and speed-to-market challenges. While these forces were already at play in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) has served to significantly transform the modern workplace in ways that offer us a clear competitive advantage. As talent preferences have shifted dramatically in the direction of flexibility, choice and control, employers struggling to compete in today’s environment must rethink the way work gets done and consider implementing new, more agile workforce strategies.
We expect to continue to evolve our client engagement and talent delivery model to take advantage of these dramatic and important shifts in the direction of flexibility, control and choice. Our unique approach to workforce strategy strongly positions us to help our clients transform their businesses and workplaces, especially at a time when high-quality talent is increasingly scarce and the usage of a flexible workforce to execute transformational projects has become the dominant operating model.
We believe that we are continuing to lay a solid foundation for the future.
Based in Irvine, California, with offices worldwide, our agile human capital model attracts top-caliber professionals with in-demand skillsets who seek a workplace environment that embraces flexibility, collaboration and human connection. Our agile professional services model allows us to quickly align the right resources for the work at hand with speed and efficiency in ways that bring value to both our clients and talent. See Part 1, Item 1 “Business”
of
our Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K for further discussions about our business and operations.
Fiscal 2023 Strategic Focus Areas
Our enterprise growth drivers and strategic focus areas in fiscal 2023 include:
 Transform digitally;  Amplify brand voice and optimize solution offerings;  Deepen client centricity;  Enhance pricing; and  Pursue targeted mergers and acquisitions.
Transform digitally
– Our first objective is to improve operational efficiency, scale business growth, transform stakeholder experience and create long-term sustainability and stockholder value through digital means .
We believe the use of technology platforms to match clients and talent is the future of professional staffing. HUGO by RGP TM
(“HUGO”), our digital engagement platform, allows such an experience for clients and talent in the professional staffing space to connect, engage and even transact directly. We piloted the platform in limited markets in October 2021, expanded into California in September 2022 and have
continued to enhance its functionality with further artificial intelligence and machine learning. We also have been developing sales and marketing strategies to increase client and talent adoption of the platform.
We plan to expand the geographic reach to other key markets within the United States (“U.S.”) such as Texas in the second half of fiscal 2023 . Over time, we expect to be able to drive volume through the HUGO platform by attracting more small- and medium-sized businesses looking for interim support and by serving a larger percentage of our current professional staffing business, which we believe will not only drive top-line growth but also enhance profitability.
We continue to execute on the multi-year project to modernize and elevate our technology infrastructure globally, including a cloud-based enterprise resource planning system and talent acquisition and management system. We believe our investment in these technology transformation initiatives will accelerate our efficiency and data-led decision-making capabilities, optimize process flow and automation, improve consultant recruitment and retention, drive business growth with operational agility, scale our operations and further support our growth, goals and vision .
As our clients continue to accelerate their digital and workforce paradigm transformations, t he need for automation and self-service has been an increasing trend, especially in light of the Pandemic. We have been focused on expanding our digital consulting capabilities and their geographic reach to drive growth in the business by capturing the market demand and opportunities .
Amplify brand voice and optimize solution offerings
– Our second focus area for this fiscal year is to bring clarity and attention to our brand positioning to own the opportunity around project execution.
RGP has always focused our business on project execution, which is a distinct space on the continuum between strategy consulting and interim deployment. Our business model of utilizing experienced talent to flatten the traditional consulting delivery pyramid is highly sought after in today’s market. Most clients are capable of formulating business strategy organically or with the help of a strategy firm; where they need help is in the ownership of executing the strategy.
22
In fiscal 2022, we introduced our new tagline ―
Dare to Work Differently.
TM
― to clarify our brand voice to align with hybrid workforce strategy and where our clients need us most:
execution with subject matter expertise. We implemented further clarification and activation of our new brand positioning in the first half of fiscal 2023. Our co-delivery ethos is focused around partnering with clients on project execution. Our brand marketing will continue to emphasize and accentuate our unique qualifications in this arena. We believe clear articulation and successful marketing of our distinctive market position is key to attracting and retaining both clients and talent, enabling us to drive continued growth.
Key focus areas supporting this initiative include: refining and finalizing our proposed solution architecture that clearly defines RGP’s core service offerings and streamlines the sales process; validating the proposed messaging and architecture via roundtables with internal and external stakeholders; and launching the new brand positioning and messaging through dynamic assets such as advertising campaigns, videos and events.
Deepen client centricity
– The third area of focus for fiscal 2023 is to continue to deepen and broaden our trusted client relationships through expanded marquee account and key industry vertical programs to increase our focus on account penetration.
We maintain our Strategic Client Account program to serve a number of our largest clients with dedicated global account teams. We have expanded, and will continue to expand, the Strategic Client Account and industry programs by adding clients and taking a more client-centric and borderless approach to serving these clients. We believe this focus enhances our opportunities to develop in-depth knowledge of these clients’ needs and the ability to increase the scope and size of projects with those clients.
In addition , we formed a new Emerging Accounts program, which consists of smaller clients where demand tends to be more episodic. Our newly formed dedicated account team will be able to serve this segment of clients with more focus and attention while nurturing and growing the depth of our relationship.
Our services continue to emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business rather than a transaction-oriented or assignment-oriented approach. Client relationships and needs are addressed from a client-centric, not geographic, perspective so that our experienced management team and consultants understand our clients’ business issues and help them define their project needs to deliver an integrated, relationship-based approach to meeting the clients’ objectives. We believe that by continuing to deliver high-quality services and by furthering our relationships with our clients, we can capture a significantly larger share of our clients’ professional services budgets.
Enhance pricing
–
Fourth, we continue to evolve and enhance our pricing strategy to ensure we adopt a value-based approach for our project execution services, which has become increasingly more relevant and in demand in the current macro environment. We believe there is ample opportunity to drive further growth in both our topline revenue and profitability through pricing.
As we deepen our client relationships and raise our clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, we anticipate further increasing bill rates for our services to appropriately capture the value of the talent and solutions delivered. Key focus areas include: creating more centralized pricing governance, strategy and approach; conducting a deep pricing analysis to identify and confront areas that need improvement; and instituting new pricing training for all sales, talent and go-to-market team members.
Pursue targeted mergers and acquisitions

Lastly, we will seek to accelerate growth through strategic mergers and acquisitions that drive additional scale or expand and complement our existing core capabilities. Following the successful acquisition and integration of Veracity Consulting Group, LLC (“Veracity”), which accelerated our digital capabilities and our ability to offer comprehensive digital innovation services, we will continue to pursue highly targeted acquisition opportunities to add scale to Veracity or augment and expand the breadth and depth of our digital transformation capabilities. In addition to digital, we are keenly interested in other consulting capabilities that would drive and foster growth opportunity for our core business.
Market Trends and Uncertainties
On a macro level, uncertain macroeconomic conditions (including rising inflation, volatility in energy and commodity prices, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, supply chain issues and labor shortages) as well as increases in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange rates have created significant uncertainty in the global economy, volatility in the capital markets and recessionary pressures. We expect these conditions will continue in the second half of fiscal 2023 and beyond. While we are not able to fully predict the potential impact, we are seeing more caution in spending within some pockets of our client base. If these conditions persist and a prolonged economic downturn or recession develops, it could result in a decline in billable hours and a negative impact on our bill rates that would adversely affect our financial results and operating cash flows.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 –
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K, and in Note 2 –
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
T here have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies, or in the estimates and assumptions underlying those policies, from those described
under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 7 of Part II of
our Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess our financial and operating performance that are not defined by or calculated in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Consolidated Statements of Operations; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable GAAP measure so calculated and presented.
Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our operating results.
 Same-day constant currency revenue is adjusted for the following items: o Currency impact. In order to remove the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we calculate same-day constant currency revenue, which represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior period.
o Business days impact. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having a different number of business days,
we calculate same-day revenue as current period revenue (adjusted for currency impact) divided by the number of business days in the current period, multiplied by the number of business days in the comparable prior period. The number of business days in each respective period is provided in the “Number of Business Days” section in the table below.  EBITDA is calculated as net income before amortization expense, depreciation expense, interest and income taxes.  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus or minus stock-based compensation expense, technology transformation costs, restructuring costs, and contingent consideration adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA at the segment level excludes certain shared corporate administrative costs that are not practical to allocate.  Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue.
24
Same-Day Constant Currency Revenue
Same-day constant currency revenue assists management in evaluating revenue trends on a more comparable and consistent basis. We believe this measure also provides more clarity to our investors in evaluating our core operating performance and facilitates a comparison of such performance from period to period. The following table presents a reconciliation of same-day constant currency revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, to revenue as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, by geography (in thousands, except number of business days).

(1) Technology transformation costs represent costs included in net income related to the Company’s initiative to upgrade its technology platform globally, including a cloud-based enterprise resource planning system and talent acquisition and management system. Such costs primarily include software licensing costs, third-party consulting fees and costs associated with dedicated internal resources that are not capitalized.
(2) The Company substantially completed the Restructuring Plans in fiscal 2021. All employee termination and facility exit costs incurred under the Restructuring Plans were considered completed as of August 27, 2022, and as a result, the remaining accrued restructuring liability on the books was released.
Our non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for revenue, net income or other measures of financial performance or financial condition prepared in accordance with GAAP for purposes of analyzing our revenue, profitability or liquidity. Further, a limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude items detailed above that have an impact on our GAAP reported results. Other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute but rather considered in addition to performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Consolidated Operating Results – Three Months Ended November 26, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended November 27, 2021
Revenue.
Revenue remained relatively consistent at $200.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023
compared to $200.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
We completed the sale of
taskforce
on May 31, 2022. Refer to Note 4 –
Dispositions
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Excluding $7.0 million of revenue contributed by
taskforce
during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased by 3.7% over the prior year quarter, or 5.7% on a same-day constant currency basis. Excluding
taskforce , average bill rate and billable hours increased 2.4% (or 4.0% constant currency) and 1.4%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023.
The following table represents our consolidated revenues by geography for the three months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively (in thousands, except percentages):

North America experienced revenue growth of 5.7% on both a GAAP basis and a same-day constant currency basis, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily driven by an improvement in average bill rate of 5.7%. Our efforts over the last fiscal year to raise bill rates have yielded positive impact on revenue growth. We will continue to optimize our pricing strategy to further align our bill rates to the value delivered to our clients. While we see some pockets of apprehension, most clients continue to demand our services in areas such as Finance and Accounting, Technology and Digital, as they advance critical change initiatives, albeit at a more deliberate pace, offsetting certain areas that are softer. The persistently tight labor market and low unemployment rate continued to support growth in our on-demand staffing revenue in the U.S., as our clients looked to us to supply quality talent to fill their temporary workforce gaps. The continued shift towards workforce agility and the increased acceptance of co-delivery and remote delivery not only enhanced our value proposition to our clients, but also allowed for better and more efficient matching of supply and demand, enabling us to achieve sustained improvement in our operational efficiency.
27
Europe revenue decreased 47.8%, or 38.5% on a same-day constant currency basis, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of the
taskforce
divestiture, revenue in Europe decreased 19.2%, or 4.9% on a same-day constant currency basis. Such decline in Europe’s revenue was primarily the result of delayed client buying patterns due to uncertainties in the macro environment.
Asia Pacific revenue improved 1.0%, or 16.0% on a same-day constant currency basis, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Similar to North America, revenue growth in Asia Pacific was across most markets, notably in Australia, India, Singapore and Philippines, driven primarily by healthy demand from our global clients as they execute on large corporate change initiatives.
Direct Cost of Services .
Direct cost of services decreased $3.5 million, or 2.9%, to $118.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from $121.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in direct cost of services was primarily attributable to a 4.8% decrease, or 1.6% on a constant currency basis, in average pay rate and a 0.7% decline in billable hours (attributed to the divestiture of
taskforce ) during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease in average pay rate was partially attributable to the divesture of
taskforce , that has historically carried higher pay rates.
Direct cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 58.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 60.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The decreased percentage compared to the prior year quarter
was primarily attributable to an improvement of 270 basis points in the overall pay/bill ratio. This favorable impact was partially offset by an increase in employee-related benefits, primarily vacation and self-insured medical costs. We seek to continue to drive improvement in the overall pay/bill ratio and indirect cost leverage through strategic pricing, while offering competitive compensation and benefits to our consultants to attract and retain the best talent in the marketplace.
The number of consultants on assignment at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 3,255 compared to 3,319 at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) was $56.8 million, or 28.3% of revenue, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $56.9 million, or 28.4% of revenue, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 . The $0.1 million improvement in SG&A year-over-year was primarily attributed to (1) lower management compensation and benefits including bonus and commissions of $3.2 million primarily related to less incentive compensation as a result of more moderate growth in the business, (2) a decrease of $0.5 million in restructuring costs as we finalized the adjustment to the previous estimate of restructuring liability and completed our restructuring activities, and (3) a reduction in occupancy costs of $0.4 million from real estate footprint reduction. These reductions in costs were offset by (1) an increase of $1.5 million in technology transformation costs incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, (2) an increase of $0.9 million in bad debt expenses incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, (3) a $0.7 million increase in business and travel expenses as business travel increased in a post-Pandemic environment to promote more effective go-to-market and business development activities, (4) a $0.6 million increase in computer software and consulting costs, and (5) a $0.3 million increase in all other general and administration expenses to support the growth of the business.
Management and administrative headcount was 907 at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 884 at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Management and administrative headcount
includes full time equivalent headcount for our seller-doer group, which is determined by utilization levels achieved by the seller-doers. Any unutilized time is converted to full time equivalent headcount.
Restructuring Costs.
We substantially completed our global restructuring and business transformation plan (the “Restructuring Plans”) in fiscal 2021. All employee termination and facility exit costs incurred under the Restructuring Plans were associated with the RGP segment, and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Restructuring costs, including real estate exit costs and adjustments to employee termination costs, associated with the restructuring activities were insignificant in the three months ended November 26, 2022 and $0.6 million for the three months ended November 27, 2021. All employee termination and facility exit costs incurred under the Restructuring Plans were considered completed as of August 27, 2022, and as a result, the remaining accrued restructuring liability on the books was released. Restructuring liability was zero and $0.4 million as of November 26, 2022 and May 28, 2022, respectively.
Amortization and Depreciation Expense.
Amortization expense was $1.2 million in the second quarter of both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 . Depreciation expense was $0.9 million in the second quarter of both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.
Income Taxes.
Income tax expense was $5.9 million (effective tax rate of 25.2%) for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $5.6 million (effective tax rate of 28.0%) for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We record tax expense based upon actual results versus a forecasted tax rate because of the volatility in our international operations that span numerous tax jurisdictions. The change in effective tax rate resulted largely from higher pre-tax income in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 while permanent book to tax differences were more favorable due to higher income tax benefits associated with the vesting of employee stock awards and interest income associated with an income tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service.
28
The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively, associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options, vesting of restricted stock awards, and disqualifying dispositions by employees of shares acquired under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).
Periodically, we review the components of both book and taxable income to prepare the tax provision. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will remain constant in the future because of the lower benefit from the U.S. statutory rate for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, the limitation on the benefit for losses in jurisdictions in which a valuation allowance for operating loss carryforwards has previously been established, and the unpredictability of timing and the amount of disqualifying dispositions of certain stock options.
Given the current earnings and anticipated future earnings of some of the Company’s foreign locations, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of certain foreign entities will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.
Comparability of Quarterly Results .
Our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and we believe they will continue to do so in the future. Certain factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described in Part I, Item 1A of our Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K and our other public filings made with the SEC. Due to these and other factors, we believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful indicators of future performance.
Consolidated Operating Results – Six Months Ended November 26, 2022 Compared to Six Months Ended November 27, 2021
Revenue.
Revenue increased $21.0 million, or 5.5%, to $404.4 million for the six months ended November 26, 2022 from $383.4 million for the six months ended November 27, 2021. On a same-day constant currency basis, revenue for the first half of fiscal 2023 increased $28.1 million, or 7.3%, compared to the first half of fiscal 2022. Billable hours increased 4.6% and the average bill rate improved 1.6% in the first half of fiscal 2023 compared to the first half of fiscal 2022. Excluding revenue from
taskforce
( $0.2 million and $13.2 million of revenue contributed by
taskforce
during the first half of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively),
revenue in the first half of fiscal 2023 increased by 9.2% compared to the first half of fiscal 2022, or 11.1% on a same-day constant currency basis. Billable hours and average bill rate for the six months ended November 26, 2022, excluding
taskforce , increased by 6.8% and 2.4% (4.0% constant currency), respectively.

Revenue grew in both North America and Asia Pacific during the six months ended November 26, 2022 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. By geography, North America and Asia Pacific experienced year-over-year growth of 11.7% and 4.2%, respectively, or 11.7% and 18.0%, respectively, on a same-day constant currency basis. We continued to benefit from stable demand for our services as clients push forward to execute their mission critical initiatives, albeit at a more deliberate pace. In addition, our sustained operational execution and efficiency enabled us to capture the broader market opportunities in the first half of the fiscal 2023. Revenues from our Strategic Client Accounts in North America and Asia Pacific grew 10.6% and 23.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, respectively. We continue to make strides in improving our bill rates during fiscal 2023. Average bill rates for the first six months of fiscal 2023 improved by 5.0% in North America while average bill rate in Asia Pacific on a constant currency basis improved by 4.1%. The powerful combination of both volume and pricing improvement resulted in sustained revenue growth over the same prior fiscal year period.
Europe revenue decreased 44.4%, or 35.4% on a same-day constant currency basis, during the six months ended November 26, 2022 compared to the six months ended November 27, 2021. Excluding the impact of the
taskforce
divestiture, revenue in Europe decreased 16.5%, or 3.0% on a same-day constant currency basis, during the six months ended November 26, 2022 compared to the six months ended November 27, 2021. The decline in Europe’s revenue was primarily the result of delayed client buying patterns due to uncertainties in the macro environment in the European region.
29
Direct Cost of Services .
Direct cost of services increased $5.4 million, or 2.3%, to $238.6 million for the six months ended November 26, 2022 from $233.2 million for the six months ended November 27, 2021. The increase in direct cost of services year over year was primarily attributable to a 4.6% increase in billable hours, partially offset by a 4.8% decrease, or 1.6% on a constant currency basis, in average pay rate in the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022. The decrease in average pay rate was partially attributable to the divesture of
taskforce , that has historically carried higher pay rates.
Direct cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 59.0% for the six months ended November 26, 2022 compared to 60.8% for the six months ended November 27, 2021. The decreased percentage compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to an improvement of 310 basis points in the overall pay/bill ratio. This favorable impact was partially offset by an increase in employee-related benefits, primarily vacation and self-insured medical costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
SG&A was $113.0 million, or 28.0% of revenue, for the six months ended November 26, 2022 compared to $108.3 million, or 28.2% of revenue, for the six months ended November 27, 2021.
Compared to the first half of fiscal year 2022, SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points largely as a result of improved operating leverage. The $4.7 million increase in SG&A year-over-year was primarily attributed to (1) an increase of $2.5 million in technology transformation costs incurred in the first half of fiscal 2023, (2) a $1.5 million increase in business and travel expenses as business travel increased in a post-Pandemic environment to promote more effective go-to-market and business development activities, (3) a $1.1 million increase in computer software and consulting costs, (4) a $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as we continue to evolve our long term incentive program to incentivize key employees to drive improved business performance, (5) an increase of $0.7 million in bad debt expenses, and (6) a $1.3 million increase in all other general and administration expenses to support the growth in the business. These incremental costs were partially offset by (1) a reduction in occupancy costs of $1.4 million from real estate footprint reduction, (2) a decrease of $1.1 million in restructuring costs as we finalized the adjustment to the previous estimate of restructuring liability and completed our restructuring activities, and (3) lower management compensation and benefits including bonus and commissions of $1.0 million due to more moderate growth in the business.
Restructuring Costs.
We substantially completed our Restructuring Plans in fiscal 2021.
Restructuring costs, including real estate exit costs and adjustments to employee termination costs, associated with the restructuring activities, were ($0.4) million and $0.7 million for the six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively.
Amortization and Depreciation Expense.
Amortization expense was $2.5 million and $2.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Depreciation expense was $1.8 million for the first six months of both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.
Income Taxes.
Income tax expense was $12.9 million (effective tax rate of 26.6%) for the six months ended November 26, 2022 compared to $10.8 million (effective tax rate of 28.3%) for the six months ended November 27, 2021. We record tax expense based upon actual results versus a forecasted tax rate because of the volatility in our international operations that span numerous tax jurisdictions. The change in effective tax rate resulted largely from higher pre-tax income in the first half of fiscal 2023 while permanent book to tax differences were more favorable due to higher income tax benefits associated with the vesting of employee stock awards and interest income associated with an income tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service.
The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $1.7 million and $0.8 million for the first half of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options, vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and disqualifying dispositions by employees of shares acquired under the ESPP.
Operating Results of Segment
On May 31, 2022, the Company divested
taskforce ; refer to Note 2 –
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
and Note 4 –
Dispositions
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Since the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and prior to the divestment, the business operated by
taskforce ,
along with its parent company, Resources Global Professionals (Germany) GmbH, an affiliate of the Company,
represented an operating segment of the Company and was reported as a part of Other Segments.
Effective May 31, 2022, the Company’s operating segments consist of RGP and Sitrick beginning with the reporting period for the three and six months ended November 26, 2022.
 RGP – a global consulting firm focused on project execution services that power clients’ operational needs and change initiatives utilizing on-demand, experienced and diverse talent; and  Sitrick – a crisis communications and public relations firm which operates under the Sitrick brand, providing corporate, financial, transactional and crisis communication and management services.
30
RGP is
the Company’s only operating segment that meets the quantitative threshold of a reportable segment . Sitrick does not individually meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as a reportable segment. Therefore, Sitrick is disclosed in Other Segments.
Prior-period comparative segment information was not restated
as a result of the divestiture of
taskforce
as we did not have a change in internal organization or the financial information our Chief Operating Decision Maker uses to assess performance and allocate resources.
The following table presents our current operating results by segment
for the
three and six months ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively (in thousands, except percentages) .

Revenue by Segment
RGP
– RGP revenue increased $8.2 million, or 4.3%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of a 2.4% increase in average bill rate and a 1.5% increase in billable hours from the prior year quarter, as discussed in the consolidated operating results discussion above. For the first half of fiscal 2023, RGP revenue increased $36.3 million, or 10.0%, to $398.6 million compared to $362.3 million for the first half of fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of a 6.9% increase in billable hours and a 3.3% increase in average bill rate year over year. Revenue from RGP represents more than 90% of total consolidated revenue and generally reflects the overall consolidated revenue trend.
The number of consultants on assignment under the RGP segment as of November 26, 2022 was 3,238 compared to 3,212 as of November 27, 2021.
Other Segments
– Other Segments’ revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 declined by $8.1 million to $2.8 million, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The revenue decrease is primarily due to the $7.0 million decline in revenue as a result of the divestiture of
taskforce
on May 31, 2022 and a $1.0 million decline in Sitrick’s revenue for the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Sitrick continued to be affected by the lingering impact of the Pandemic on the court system resulting in more settlements, hindering leads for revenue generation in the business. For the first half of fiscal 2023, revenue from Other Segments decreased $15.2 million, or 72.3%, to $5.8 million from $21.0 million for the first half of fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of a $13.0 million decline in revenue from the divestiture of
taskforce
in the current year and a $2.2 million decline in Sitrick revenue.
The number of consultants on assignment under Other Segments as of November 26, 2022 was 17 compared to 107 as of November 27, 2021. The decrease was related to the divestiture of
taskforce .
31
Adjusted EBITDA by Segment
RGP
– RGP’s Adjusted EBITDA increased $5.5 million, or 17.3%, to $37.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $32.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Compared to the prior year quarter, revenue increased $8.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which was partially offset by the increase in the related cost of services of $2.0 million and the decrease in other income of $0.3 million.
Additionally, SG&A costs attributed to RGP increased $0.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the second quarter fiscal 2022 primarily due to
the increase in management compensation expense of $1.9 million as a result of growth in the business as well as employee compensation adjustments to remain competitive in the current labor market;
a $0.8 million increase in computer software and consulting costs; an increase of $0.7 million in other business and travel expenses as business travel increased in a post-Pandemic environment to promote more effective go-to-market activities; and a $0.8 million increase in all other general and administration expenses to support the growth in the business. These cost increases were partially offset by reductions in bonus and commissions of $3.5 million as a result of more moderate year over year business growth and a decrease in occupancy costs of $0.3 million
from real estate footprint reduction . For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the material costs and expenses attributable to the RGP segment that are not included in computing the segment measure of Adjusted EBITDA included depreciation and amortization expenses of $2.0 million and stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million.
RGP’s Adjusted EBITDA increased $14.8 million, or 24.2%, to $76.0 million for the first half of fiscal 2023, compared to $61.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the $36.3 million increase in revenue
for the first half of fiscal 2023, which was
partially offset by the increase in the cost of services of $15.6 million
and the decrease in other income of $0.2 million . Additionally, SG&A costs attributed to RGP increased $5.5 million for the first half of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first half of fiscal 2022 primarily due to the increase in management compensation of $4.1 million
as a result of growth in the business as well as employee compensation adjustments to remain competitive in the current labor market ; a
$1.3 million increase in other business and travel expenses; a $1.3 million increase in computer software and consulting costs; a $0.7 million increase in recruiting expenses; and a $1.4 million increase in all other general and administration expenses to support the growth in the business. These cost increases
were partially offset by reductions in bonuses and commissions of $2.5 million as a result
of more moderate year over year business growth
and a decrease in occupancy costs of $0.8 million
from real estate footprint reduction . For the first six months of fiscal 2023, the material costs and expenses attributable to the RGP segment that are not included in computing the segment measure of adjusted EBITDA included depreciation and amortization expenses of $4.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million.
The trend in revenue, cost of services and other costs and expenses at RGP
compared to the prior year period is generally consistent with those at the consolidated level, as discussed above, with the exception that the SG&A used to derive segment Adjusted EBITDA does not include certain unallocated corporate administrative costs.
Other Segments
– Other Segments’ Adjusted EBITDA declined $0.9 million, or 73.1%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
The decline was primarily driven by the $8.1 million decrease in revenue due to the divestiture of
taskforce
and slow business recovery in Sitrick from the Pandemic, which is partially offset by a $5.6 million decrease in the cost of services. In addition, management compensation decreased by $1.1 million, and bonus and commissions decreased by $0.5 million, which are primarily attributed to the divestiture of
taskforce . For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the material costs and expenses attributable to the Other Segments that are not included in computing the segment measure of Adjusted EBITDA included depreciation and amortization expenses of less than $0.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million.
Other Segments’ Adjusted EBITDA declined $1.6 million, or 71.0%, to $0.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. The decline is attributable to the $15.2 million decrease in revenue due to the divestiture of
taskforce
at the beginning of fiscal 2023 and slow business recovery in Sitrick from the Pandemic, which is partially offset by a $10.2 million decrease in the cost of services.
In addition, management compensation decreased by $1.9 million, bonus and commissions decreased by $1.0 million, and occupancy costs were reduced by $0.5 million, which are primarily
attributed to the divestiture of
taskforce .
For the first six months of fiscal 2023, the material costs and expenses attributable to the Other Segments that are not included in computing the segment measure of adjusted EBITDA included depreciation and amortization expenses of $0.1 million and stock-based compensation of $0.5 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, our $175.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (as discussed further below) and historically, to a lesser extent, stock option exercises and ESPP purchases. On an annual basis, we have generated positive cash flows from operations since inception. Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future will depend, at least in part, on global economic conditions and our ability to remain resilient during periods of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and any economic downturns. As of November 26, 2022, we had $89.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, including $40.3 million held in international operations.
32
Prior to November 12, 2021, the Company had a $120.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Previous Credit Facility”) with Bank of America, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement dated October 17, 2016 between the Company and Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and Bank of America, N.A. as lender (as amended, the “Previous Credit Agreement”). The Previous Credit Agreement was scheduled to mature on October 17, 2022.
On November 12, 2021, the Company and Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a new credit agreement with the lenders that are party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders
( the “New Credit Agreement”), and concurrently terminated the Previous Credit Facility. The New Credit Agreement provides for a $175.0 million senior secured revolving loan (the “New Credit Facility”), which includes a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a swingline sublimit of $20.0 million. The New Credit Facility also includes an option to increase the amount of the revolving loan up to an additional $75.0 million, subject to the terms of the New Credit Agreement. The New Credit Facility matures on November 12, 2026. The obligations under the New Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Company, Resources Connection LLC and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.
As of November 26, 2022, we had $20.0 million outstanding under the New Credit Facility. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum of either, at the Company’s election, (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the New Credit Agreement), plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.00% with the applicable margin depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, the Company pays an unused commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the New Credit Facility, which ranges from 0.20% to 0.30% depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio.
On November 2, 2022, Resources Global Enterprise Consulting (Beijing) Co., Ltd , (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company), as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor,
entered into a RMB 13.4 million (USD $1.8 million based on the prevailing exchange on November 2, 2022) revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. (Beijing) as the lender
(the “Beijing Revolver”).
The Beijing Revolver bears interest at loan prime rate plus 0.80%. Interest incurred on borrowings will be payable monthly in arrears. As of November 26, 2022, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Beijing Revolver.
The New Credit Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions, dividend distribution and stock repurchases. Additional information regarding the Company’s debt is included in Note 7 –
Long-Term Debt
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
In addition to cash needs for ongoing business operations, from time to time, we have strategic initiatives that could generate significant additional cash requirements. Our initiative to upgrade our technology platform, as described in “Fiscal 2023 Strategic Focus Areas” above, requires significant investments over multiple years.
During the first six months of fiscal 2023, we refined the deployment roadmap and the estimated
amount of the investments required for this multi-year initiative to be in the range of $30.0 million to $33.0 million through the completion of the system implementation. Such costs primarily include software licensing fees, third-party implementation and consulting fees, incremental costs associated with additional internal resources needed on the project and other costs in areas including change management and training. The actual amount of investment and the timing will depend on a number of variables, including progress made on the implementation. We expect the majority of the investment will take place in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. In addition to our technology transformation initiative, we expect to continue to invest in digital pathways to enhance the experience and touchpoints with our end users, including current and prospective employees (consultants and management employees) and clients. Such effort will require additional cash outlay and could further elevate our capital expenditures in the near term. We believe our current cash, ongoing cash flows from our operations and funding available under our New Credit Facility will provide sufficient funds for these initiatives. As of November 26, 2022, we have non-cancellable purchase obligations totaling $13.4 million, which primarily consists of payments pursuant to the licensing arrangements that we have entered into in connection with this initiative: $0.5 million due during the remaining half of fiscal 2023; $4.0 million due during fiscal 2024; $3.7 million due during fiscal 2025; $2.1 million due during fiscal 2026; and $3.1 million due thereafter.
We have completed our restructuring initiatives globally and do not expect any future cash requirements for these restructuring initiatives. Other trends impacting our near-term liquidity include the deferral of payroll taxes under the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)
and certain tax planning strategies implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The CARES Act includes provisions, among others, allowing deferral of the employer portion of the social security payroll taxes and addressing the carryback of net operating losses (“NOLs”) for specific periods. We previously elected to defer the employer portion of social security payroll taxes through December 31, 2020 totaling $12.6 million. Subsequent to the deferral, we elected to make partial repayments of $8.6 million in calendar year 2021. We paid the remaining $4.0 million of deferred payroll taxes
subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 . In addition, as part of our tax planning strategies, we made certain changes related to the capitalization of fixed assets effective for fiscal 2021. This strategy allowed us to carry back the NOLs of fiscal 2021 to fiscal years 2016 to 2018 and allowed us to request refunds for alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credits for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. We recognized a discrete tax benefit of $12.8 million in fiscal 2021 and filed for a federal income tax refund in the amount of $34.8 million (before interest) in April 2022.
As of November 26, 2022, we have received a refund of
$10.3 million (including interest income). In December 2022, subsequent to the second quarter, we received an additional $9.3 million (including interest income). We expect to
33
receive the remainder of the refund in the early part of calendar year 2023; however, there may be unanticipated processing delays that postpone receipt .
As described under Market Trends and Uncertainties, uncertain macroeconomic conditions and increases in interest rates have created significant uncertainty in the global economy, volatility in the capital markets and recessionary pressures, which may adversely impact our financial results, operating cash flows and liquidity needs. If we are required to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness for our operations or to invest in our business, we can provide no assurances that we would be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all. Our ongoing operations and growth strategy may require us to continue to make investments in critical markets and further expand our internal technology and digital capabilities. In addition, we may consider making strategic acquisitions or initiating additional restructuring initiatives, which could require significant liquidity and adversely impact our financial results due to higher cost of borrowings. We believe that our current cash, ongoing cash flows from our operations and funding available under our New Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months.
Beyond the next 12 months, if we require additional capital resources to grow our business, either organically or through acquisitions, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, increase use of our New Credit Facility, expand the size of our New Credit Facility or raise additional debt. In addition, if we decide to make additional share repurchases, we may fund these through existing cash balances or use of our New Credit Facility. The sale of additional equity securities or certain forms of debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
Our ability to secure additional financing in the future, if needed, will depend on several factors. These include our future profitability and the overall condition of the credit markets. Notwithstanding these considerations,
we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.
Other than as described herein, there have been no material changes to our material cash requirements, including commitments for capital expenditures, described under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 of Part II of our Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K.
Operating Activities
Operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2023 provided cash of $23.7 million compared to $3.5 million cash provided for the first six months of fiscal 2022. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, cash provided by operations resulted from net income of $35.6 million and non-cash adjustments of $6.2 million. Additionally, net unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $18.2 million, primarily consisting of a $20.5 million decrease in accrued salaries and related obligations, mainly due to the timing of our pay cycle and the payout of the annual incentive during the first six months of fiscal 2023; a $4.8 million decrease in other liabilities (which included a $2.7 million settlement of the previously recorded deposit liability at the completion of the sale of
taskforce
on May 31, 2022); and a $3.3 million increase in trade accounts receivable. These unfavorable changes are partially offset by a $6.2 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, largely due to the receipt of a $10.3 million of tax refund, and a $3.9 million increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses.
In the first six months of fiscal 2022, cash provided by operations resulted from net income of $27.2 million and non-cash adjustments of $8.8 million. Additionally, for the first half of fiscal 2022, net unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $32.5 million, primarily consisting of a $29.2 million increase in trade accounts receivable, mainly attributable to accelerated revenue growth throughout the first half of fiscal 2022, the final Veracity contingent consideration payment, of which $3.7 million was categorized as operating (the remaining $3.3 million of the total $7.0 million contingent consideration payment was categorized as financing cash flow) and a $3.1 million increase in income taxes receivable due to timing of estimated quarterly tax payments.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to the net cash used of $2.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2022. Net cash provided by investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2023 was primarily related to the cash proceeds from the divestiture of
taskforce
partially offset by the cost incurred for the development of internal-use software and acquisition of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2022 was primarily for the development of internal-use software and acquisition of property and equipment.
34
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $38.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 compared to $3.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022. Net cash used in financing activities during the first six months of fiscal 2023 consisted of net repayments on the New Credit Facility of $34.0 million (consisting of $49.0 million of repayments and $15.0 million of proceeds), cash dividend payments of $9.4 million, and $5.3 million to purchase 318,438 shares of common stock on the open market; these uses were partially offset by $10.3 million in proceeds received from ESPP share purchases and employee stock option exercises.
Net cash used in financing activities
during the first six months of fiscal 2022 consisted of $9.3 million in cash dividends paid, the final Veracity contingent consideration payment, of which $3.3 million was categorized as financing, and the Expertence contingent consideration payment of $0.3 million, partially offset by $0.4 million of net borrowings under both the Previous Credit Facility and the New Credit Facility, and $9.2 million in proceeds received from ESPP share purchases and employee stock option exercises.
ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Interest Rate Risk.
We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our cash and cash equivalents and our borrowings under the New Credit Facility that bear interest at a variable market rate.
As of November 26, 2022, we had approximately $89.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. The earnings on cash and cash equivalents are subject to changes in interest rates; however, assuming a constant balance available for investment, a 10% decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income but would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
As of November 26, 2022, we had $20.0 million of borrowings under our New Credit Facility. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to fluctuations in the term SOFR rate and, to a lesser extent, the loan prime rate on the Beijing Revolver. See “Sources and Uses of Liquidity” above and
Note 7 –
Long-Term Debt
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for further discussion about the interest rate on our New Credit Facility and the Beijing Revolver .
At the current level of borrowing under the New Credit Facility of $20.0 million as of November 26, 2022, a 10% change in interest rates would have resulted in a $0.1 million change in annual interest expense. To the extent that there is a significant increase in the level of borrowings, a sharp rise in interest rate could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.
For the six months ended November 26, 2022, approximately 13.9% of our revenues were generated outside of the U.S. As a result, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Thus, as the value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non-U.S.-based operations, our reported results may vary.
Assets and liabilities of our non-U.S.-based operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate effective at the end of each monthly reporting period. Approximately 55.0% of our balances of cash and cash equivalents as of November 26, 2022 were denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining amount of approximately 45.0% was comprised primarily of cash balances translated from Euros, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Indian Rupee, and Mexican Pesos. The difference resulting from the translation in each period of assets and liabilities of our non-U.S.-based operations is recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
Although we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, we do not currently use financial hedges to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations including in a limited number of circumstances when we may be asked to transact with our client in one currency but are obligated to pay our consultants in another currency. Our foreign entities typically transact with clients and consultants in their local currencies and generate enough operating cash flows to fund their own operations. We believe our economic exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has not been material. However, we cannot provide assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future.
