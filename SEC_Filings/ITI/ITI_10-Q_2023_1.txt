Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements December 31, 2022 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Iteris, Inc. (referred to collectively in this report as "Iteris," the "Company," "we," "our," and "us") is a provider of smart mobility infrastructure management solutions. Our cloud-enabled end-to-end solutions help public transportation agencies, municipalities, commercial entities and other transportation infrastructure providers monitor, visualize, and optimize mobility infrastructure to make mobility safe, efficient and sustainable for everyone. As a pioneer in intelligent transportation systems ("ITS") technology, our intellectual property, products and software-as-a-service ("SaaS") offerings represent a comprehensive range of ITS solutions that we distribute to customers throughout the U.S. and internationally. We believe our solutions increase safety and decrease congestion within our communities, while also reducing urban emissions and other negative environmental conditions. We continue to make significant investments to leverage our existing technologies and further expand both our advanced detection sensors and mobility analytics software and related data sets for transportation and infrastructure management. Additionally, we are always exploring strategic alternatives intended to optimize the value of our Company. Iteris was incorporated in Delaware in 1987 and has operated in its current form since 2004. Recent Developments COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) has materially adversely impacted global economic conditions. COVID-19 continues to have an unpredictable and unprecedented impact on the global economy. Though there has been a trend of increasing availability of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions, infection rates continue to fluctuate and federal, state and local government regulations continue to rapidly change. The uncertainties caused by the Pandemic include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, workplace dislocations, economic contraction, and downward pressure on some customer budgets and customer sentiment in general. We have not had any facility closures due to the Pandemic, but we have experienced supply chain and work delays on certain projects. Should such delays continue or worsen or should longer-term budgets or priorities of our clients be impacted, the Pandemic could further negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the Pandemic on our business and financial results, and the volatility of our stock price will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the Pandemic, new and potentially more contagious variants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, the impact on capital and financial markets, the distribution, rate of adoption and efficacy of vaccines, and the related impact on the budgets and financial circumstances of our customers and suppliers, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of this report. Given the uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the Pandemic on the Company's future financial condition and results of operations, we have taken certain actions to preserve our liquidity, manage cash flow and strengthen our financial flexibility. Such actions include, but are not limited to, reducing our discretionary spending, reducing capital expenditures, and implementing restructuring activities. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, for more information.
Our products require specialized parts which have become more difficult to source. In some cases, we have had to purchase such parts from third-party brokers at substantially higher prices. Additionally, to mitigate for component shortages, we have increased inventory levels. In the event demand doesn't materialize, we would need to hold excess inventory for several quarters. Alternatively, we may be unable to source sufficient components at any price, even from third-party brokers, to meet customer demand, resulting in high levels of backlog that we were unable to ship. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our normal lead times to secure normal and incremental future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.
Due to the supply chain environment, the Company increased inventory by approximately $ 4.5
million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as part of the Company's supply chain strategy. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, inventory decreased from September 30, 2022 by a net $ 0.4
million and we had working capital of approximately $ 24.7
million as of December 31, 2022. The cash flow used in operating activities of our continuing operations was approximately $ 10.8
million, resulting in $ 2.8  million of cash provided by continuing operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Cash used during the fiscal year was primarily driven by the planned increase in inventory and the re-design of certain circuit boards as part of the Company’s supply chain strategy to help assure the Company has enough product to satisfy customer demand, and the net operating loss as a result of higher inventory component costs related to the global supply chain constraints. The Company's tactics to mitigate the current global supply chain issues included re-designing certain circuit
6 Table of Contents boards to accommodate computer chips that are more readily available in the market at more reasonable prices, and by accumulating inventory in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2023. The increase in inventory purchases and in particular components purchased in the secondary markets has been curtailed, and the Company does not expect to continue to accumulate inventory in the future, in the same magnitude, in future periods. However, we might encounter additional supply-chain constraints in the future. If we do, the Company may need to further adjust its operations to have sufficient liquidity. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act provides relief to U.S. corporations through financial assistance programs and modifications to certain income tax provisions. The Company applied certain beneficial provisions of the CARES Act, including the payroll tax deferral and the alternative minimum tax acceleration. Refer to Note 5, Income Taxes, for more information. The Pandemic has had an impact on the Company’s human capital. While our Santa Ana product and commercial operations facility has remained open throughout the Pandemic, easing of Pandemic restrictions imposed by local and state authorities have allowed a larger portion of our workforce to return to our various facilities while others continue to work remotely. The Company’s information technology infrastructure has proven sufficiently flexible to minimize disruptions in required duties and responsibilities.
Additionally, we have been able to timely file financial reports. We believe we have the infrastructure to efficiently work remotely during the Pandemic.
The Company assessed the impacts of the Pandemic on the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our unaudited condensed financial statements. The estimates and assumptions used in our assessments were based on management’s judgment and may be subject to change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the Pandemic and its resulting impact on global economic conditions. If economic conditions caused by the Pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management, the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially impacted. The Company will continue to assess the effect on its operations by monitoring the spread of the Pandemic and the actions implemented to combat the virus throughout the world. As a result, our assessment of the impact of the Pandemic may change. Restructuring Activities To help offset recent increases in supply chain costs, on May 12, 2022, the Board of Directors of Iteris, Inc. approved additional restructuring activities to better position the Company for increased profitability and growth. The Company incurred employee separation costs in relation to these activities, which were included in restructuring charges on the unaudited condensed statement of operations. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, for more information.
Basis of Presentation Our unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim reporting, which permit certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) to be condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and related notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”), filed with the SEC on June 1, 2022. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for Fiscal 2023 or any other periods. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Other significant estimates include the collectability of accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts, projections of taxable income used to assess realizability of deferred tax assets, warranty reserves and other contingencies, costs to complete long-term contracts, indirect cost rates used in cost plus contracts, the valuation of inventories, the valuation of purchased intangible assets and goodwill, the valuation of investments, estimates of future cash flows used to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets and the impairment of goodwill, and fair value of our stock option awards used to calculate stock-based compensation. 7 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Product revenue related contracts with customers begin when we acknowledge a purchase order for a specific customer order of product to be delivered in the near term. These purchase orders are generally short-term in nature. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time upon shipment or upon customer receipt of the product, depending on shipping terms. The Company determined that this method best represents the transfer of goods as transfer of control typically occurs upon shipment or upon customer receipt of the product. Service revenues consist of revenues derived from maintenance support and the use of the Company’s service platforms and Application Programming Interfaces ("API's") on a subscription basis. We generate this revenue from fees for maintenance and support, monthly active user fees, SaaS fees, and hosting and storage fees. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The Company applies a time-based measure of progress to the total transaction price, which results in ratable recognition over the term of the contract. The Company determined that this method best represents the transfer of services as the customer obtains equal benefit from the service throughout the service period. Service revenues are also derived from long-term engineering and consulting service contracts with governmental agencies. These contracts generally include performance obligations in which control is transferred over time. We recognize revenue on fixed fee contracts, over time, using the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract performance obligation. The Company determined that this method best represents the transfer of services as the proportion closely depicts the efforts or inputs completed towards the satisfaction of a fixed fee contract performance obligation. Time & Materials (“T&M”) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (“CPFF”) contracts are considered to involve variable consideration. However, contractual performance obligations with these fee types qualify for the “Right to Invoice” practical expedient. Under this practical expedient, the Company is allowed to recognize revenue, over time, in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice. In addition, the Company is not required to estimate such variable consideration upon inception of the contract and reassess the estimate each reporting period. The Company determined that this method best represents the transfer of services as, upon billing, the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date. The Company accounts for individual goods and services separately if they are distinct performance obligations, which often requires significant judgment based upon knowledge of the products and/or services, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS agreements, we provide a service to the customer that combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single performance obligation. In product-related contracts, a purchase order may cover different products, each constituting a separate performance obligation. We generally estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled and in certain cases based on the expected value, which requires judgment. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. We review and update these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Company’s typical performance obligations include the following: Performance Obligation When Performance Obligation is Typically Satisfied When Payment is Typically Due How Standalone Selling Price is Typically Estimated Product Revenues Standard purchase orders for delivery of a tangible product Upon shipment (point in time) Within 30 days of delivery Observable transactions Engineering services where the deliverable is considered a product As work is performed (over time) Within 30 days of services being invoiced Estimated using a cost-plus margin approach Service Revenues 8 Table of Contents Engineering services, managed services, and consulting services As work is performed (over time) Within 30 days of services being invoiced Estimated using a cost-plus margin approach SaaS services Over the course of the SaaS service once the system is available for use (over time) At the beginning of the contract period Estimated using a cost-plus margin approach Disaggregation of Revenue The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into product revenues and services revenues.
Trade Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances We classify our right to consideration in exchange for goods and services as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment is due). We present such receivables in trade accounts receivable, net, in our unaudited condensed balance sheets at their net estimated realizable value. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. If warranted, the allowance is increased by the Company’s provision for doubtful accounts, which is charged against income. All recoveries on receivables previously charged off are included in income, while direct charge-offs of receivables are deducted from the allowance. A contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Contract assets are presented as unbilled accounts receivable on the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheets. For example, we would record a contract asset if we record revenue on a professional services engagement, but are not entitled to bill until we achieve specified milestones. Our contract assets and refund liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Refund liabilities are consideration received in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations. Contract Fulfillment Costs The Company evaluates whether or not we should capitalize the costs of fulfilling a contract. Such costs would be capitalized when they are not within the scope of other standards and: (1) are directly related to a contract; (2) generate or enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations; and (3) are expected to be recovered.

million of contract fulfillment costs as of each of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, which are presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheets as prepaid and other current assets. These costs primarily relate to the satisfaction of performance obligations related to the set-up of SaaS platforms. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the SaaS platform.
Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was immaterial, primarily as a result of the termination provisions within our contracts, which make the duration of the accounting term of the contract one year or less. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue in the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheets is comprised of refund liabilities related to billings and consideration received in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. 9 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits and money market funds maintained with two financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with high quality financial institutions, and therefore are believed to have minimal credit risk. Our accounts receivable are primarily derived from billings with customers located throughout North America, as well as in Europe and South America. We generally do not require collateral or other security from our domestic customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses, which losses have historically been within management’s expectations. We currently have, and historically have had, a diverse customer base.
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no individual customer represented greater than 10% of our total revenues. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022,
no
individual customer represented greater than 10% of our total accounts receivable. Fair Values of Financial Instruments The fair value of cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate carrying value because of the short period of time to maturity. Our investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The framework for measuring fair value and related disclosure requirements about fair value measurements are provided in Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820,
Fair Value Measurements
(“ASC 820”). This pronouncement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prescribed by ASC 820 contains three levels as follows: Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3—Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments with initial maturities of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, restricted cash was $ 0.3
million and $ 0.1
million, respectively, consisting of cash restricted for shares purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") (See Note 8, Stock-Based Compensation, for further details on the ESPP). Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed statements of cash flows consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,216   $ 23,689   Restricted cash 277   120   $ 10,493   $ 23,809   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The collectability of our accounts receivable is evaluated through review of outstanding invoices and ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale, we will record an allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduce the net recognized accounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. We also maintain an allowance based on our historical collections experience. When we determine that collection is not likely, we write off accounts receivable against the allowance for doubtful accounts. 10 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life ranging from
three
to
eight years . Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with determinable economic lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of each asset on a straight-line basis. The Company determines the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors the Company considers when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the Company's long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets We perform an annual qualitative assessment of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If events or circumstances do not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required; if otherwise, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss. We monitor the indicators for goodwill impairment testing between annual tests. In prior years the Company had
two
operating and reportable segments, Roadway Sensors ("RWS") and Transportation Systems ("SYS"), which also represented the reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. In Fiscal 2021, in conjunction with the re-organization as described in Note 10, Business Segments, the Company also reassessed the reporting unit conclusion and determined that there are
three
reporting units and a single operating and reportable segment. As of December 31, 2022, there were no indicators of goodwill impairment.
We test long-lived assets and purchased intangible assets (other than goodwill) for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist. We determine whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recoverable, based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset is not recoverable, we record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. We primarily use the income valuation approach to determine the fair value of our long-lived assets and purchased intangible assets.
Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, which increases our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. As such, as of December 31, 2022, we determined it was appropriate to record a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We will continuously reassess the appropriateness of maintaining a valuation allowance. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. 11 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation We record stock-based compensation in our unaudited condensed statements of operations as an expense, based on the estimated grant date fair value of our stock-based awards, whereby such fair values are amortized over the requisite service period. Our stock-based awards are currently comprised of common stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units. The fair value of our common stock option awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula. The fair value of our performance stock unit awards is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. While the use of these models meets established requirements, the estimated fair values generated by the models may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees, such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements, as well as limited transferability. The fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock-based awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense.
Research and Development Expenditures Research and development expenditures are charged to expense in the period incurred. Warranty We generally provide a
one - to
three-year
warranty from the original invoice date on all products, materials and workmanship. Products sold to various original equipment manufacturer customers sometimes carry longer warranties. Defective products will be either repaired or replaced, usually at our option, upon meeting certain criteria. We accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized. The accrued warranty reserve is included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheets. We do not provide any service-type warranties. Repair and Maintenance Costs We incur repair and maintenance costs in the normal course of business. Should the repair or maintenance result in a permanent improvement to one of our leased facilities, the cost is capitalized as a leasehold improvement and amortized over its useful life or the remainder of the lease period, whichever is shorter. Non-permanent repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Comprehensive Income (Loss) The difference between net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) was de minimis for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This standard update requires that certain financial assets be measured at amortized cost net of an allowance for estimated credit losses such that the net receivable represents the present value of expected cash collection. In addition, this standard update requires that certain financial assets be measured at amortized cost reflecting an allowance for estimated credit losses expected to occur over the life of the assets. The estimate of credit losses must be based on all relevant information including historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the amounts. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates, which defers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 for all entities except SEC reporting companies that are not smaller reporting companies. We are currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 on our unaudited condensed financial statements. 12 Table of Contents 2.

Restructuring Activities On May 12, 2022, the Board of Directors of Iteris, Inc. approved restructuring activities to better position the Company for increased profitability and growth. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred approximately $ 0.0 million
and $ 0.7  million, respectively, related to employee separation costs in relation to these activities which were included in restructuring charges on the unaudited condensed statement of operations.
As of December 31, 2022, we had accrued approximately $ 0.4  million for severance and benefits related to the restructuring activities in accrued payroll and related expenses on the unaudited condensed balance sheet.
The restructuring activities during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 were as follows (in thousands):
Balance at March 31, 2022 $ —   Charged to expenses 707   Cash payments ( 19 ) Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 688   Cash payments ( 149 ) Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 539   Cash payments $ ( 160 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 379   15 Table of Contents 4. Fair Value Measurements We measure fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based on a three tier hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or prices quoted in inactive markets; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability, and for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring management to utilize its own assumptions to provide its best estimate of what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. We did not have any material financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as of December 31, 2022 or March 31, 2022. Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, generally when there is a transaction involving those assets such as a purchase transaction, a business combination or an adjustment for impairment. As a result of the re-organization completed in April 2021, the Company reallocated goodwill to the
three
new reporting units.
No
non-financial assets were measured at fair value at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
The following tables present the Company’s financial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated among the appropriate levels within the fair value hierarchy: As of December 31, 2022 (In thousands) Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Loss Gross Unrealized Gain Estimated Fair Value Assets: Level 1: Securities held in deferred compensation plan

(2) Included in accrued payroll and related expenses on the Company’s balance sheet. (3) As of March 31, 2022, the short-term portion of the balance of contingent consideration was included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion was included in other long-term liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of contingent consideration was all short-term and included in accrued liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition of the assets of TrafficCast completed on December 7, 2020, contingent consideration relating to an earnout of up to $ 1.0  million was recorded at its fair value of $ 0.6  million, of which $ 0.3  million was paid on April 1, 2022. The Company has recorded a net increase of $ 0.2  million in the fair value of this contingent consideration as of December 31, 2022, and the current fair value remaining is $ 0.5  million and is due on March 31, 2023, if earned.
The contingent consideration representing Level 3 fair value measurement was prepared using the following assumptions:
Assumptions Risk free rate 0.14 % Counter party risk premium 8.20 % Revenue WACC 6.00 % Revenue volatility 25.00 % Unrealized losses related to investments are due to interest rate fluctuations as opposed to credit quality. In addition, we do not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that, we would be required to sell, any of our investments before recovery of their cost basis. As a result, there was no other-than-temporary impairment for these investments as of December 31, 2022. 5. Income Taxes The effective tax rate used for interim periods is the estimated annual effective tax rate, based on current estimate of full year results, except that taxes related to specific events, if any, are recorded in the interim period in which they occur. 17 Table of Contents Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 0.0  million and $ 0.1
million, or ( 1.3 )% and ( 1.1 )%, respectively, of pre-tax loss, as compared with an expense of approximately $ 0.4
million and $ 0.2
million, or ( 18.5 )% and ( 5.5 )%, respectively, of pre-tax loss for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we review all available positive and negative evidence, including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, potential carrybacks, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. As we have experienced a cumulative pre-tax loss over the trailing three years, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the Pandemic. The CARES Act contains numerous income tax provisions, such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The income tax provisions of the CARES Act had an immaterial impact on our current taxes, deferred taxes, and uncertain tax positions of the Company in the year ended March 31, 2022. The CARES Act also allows for the deferral of payroll taxes, as well as the immediate refund of federal Alternative Minimum Tax credits, which had previously been made refundable over a period of four years by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had repaid all amounts deferred under the CARES Act.
6. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Other Contingencies
As a provider of traffic engineering services, hardware products, software and other various solutions for the traffic industry, the Company is, and may in the future from time to time, be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. While the Company cannot accurately predict the outcome of any such litigation, the Company is not a party to any legal proceeding, the outcome of which, in management’s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited condensed results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 7. Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities We have various operating leases for our offices, office equipment and vehicles in the United States. These leases expire at various times through 2029. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options from
1
year to
5
years, rent abatement, and escalation clauses that are factored into our determination of lease payments when appropriate. The table below presents lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the unaudited condensed balance sheet as follows: Classification December 31, 2022 (In thousands) Assets Operating lease right-of-use-assets Right-of-use assets $ 8,834   Total operating lease right-of-use-assets $ 8,834   Liabilities Operating lease liabilities (short-term) Accrued liabilities $ 2,307   Operating lease liabilities (long-term) Lease liabilities 8,228   Total lease liabilities $ 10,535   18 Table of Contents Lease Costs We recorded approximately $ 0.6
million and $ 2.0
million of lease costs in our unaudited condensed statements of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to approximately $ 0.7
million and $ 2.1
million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The Company currently has
no
variable lease costs. The Company recorded a de minimis amount of sublease income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, which was included in loss from discontinued operations on the unaudited condensed statement of operations. Supplemental Information The table below presents supplemental information related to operating leases during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands, except weighted average information): Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 1,063 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 4.08 Weighted average discount rate 4.8   % Maturities of Lease Liabilities Maturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: Fiscal Year Ending March 31, Operating Leases (In thousands) 2023 $ 724   2024 2,720   2025 2,479   2026 2,149   2027 2,178   Thereafter 1,490   Total lease payments 11,740   Less imputed interest ( 1,205 ) Present value of future lease payments 10,535   Less current obligations under leases ( 2,307 ) Long-term lease obligations $ 8,228   8. Stock-Based Compensation We currently maintain
two
stock incentive plans, the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”). Of these plans, we may only grant future awards from the 2016 Plan. The 2016 Plan allows for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, time-restricted stock units (“RSUs"), performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs”), cash incentive awards and other stock-based awards. At December 31, 2022, there were approximately
2.2
million shares of common stock available for grant or issuance under the 2016 Plan. Total stock options vested and expected to vest were approximately

212,216
PSUs to our executive officers. Between
0 % and
160 % of the PSUs will be eligible to vest based on average annual performance during the
three-year
performance period relative to the revenues per share and cash flow from operations objectives to be established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of each year. In addition, the final PSU vesting based on the revenues per share and cash flow from operations performance will be subject to a modifier between .75x-1.25x based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to the Russell 2000 during the performance period, for a maximum achievement percentage of
200 % of the "target" number of PSUs. The PSUs are amortized over a derived service period of
3
years. The value and the derived service period of the PSUs were estimated using the Monte-Carlo simulation model.

million, $ 1.2
million and $ 0.1
million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, RSUs and PSUs, respectively. This expense is currently expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately
2.9
years for stock options,
1.7
years for RSUs and
1.5
years for PSUs. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future stock-based compensation expense and unearned stock-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional stock options, RSUs or other stock-based awards. Other Stock-Based Compensation Plans We currently maintain an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) which allows employees to have a percentage of their base compensation withheld to purchase the Company’s common stock at
95 % of the lower of the fair market at the beginning of the offering period and on the last trading day of the offering period. There are
two
offering periods during a calendar year, which consist of the
six months
beginning each January 1 and July 1. Employees may contribute
1 - 15 % of their eligible gross pay up to a $ 0.03
million annual stock value limit. In July 2022,
84,426
shares related to the first offering period of Fiscal 2023 were purchased. In July 2021,
44,449
shares related to the first offering period of Fiscal 2022 were purchased.
Deferred Compensation Plan Effective October 1, 2020, the Company adopted the Iteris, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DC Plan"). The DC Plan consists of
two
plans, one that is intended to be an unfunded arrangement for eligible employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, and one for the benefit of non-employee members of our board of directors. Key employees, including our executive officers, and our non-employee directors who are notified regarding their eligibility to participate and delivered the DC Plan enrollment materials are eligible to participate in the DC Plan. Under the DC Plan, we provide participants with the opportunity to make annual elections to defer a percentage of their eligible cash compensation and equity awards. A participant is always 100% vested in his or her own elective cash deferrals and any earnings thereon. Elective deferrals of equity awards are credited to a bookkeeping account established in the name of the participant with respect to an equivalent number of shares of our common stock, and such credited shares are subject to the same vesting conditions as are applicable to the equity award subject to the election. The Company established a rabbi trust to finance our obligations under the DC Plan with corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants, and the assets held within this trust are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. The assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair value, which represents their respective amortized cost values plus any unrealized gains or losses. Refer to Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, for further detail on the DC plan. 9. Stock Repurchase Program On August 9, 2012, the Board approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we could acquire up to $ 3.0
million of our outstanding common stock for an unspecified length of time. Under the program, we could repurchase shares from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions and block trades, and could also repurchase shares pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan during our closed trading windows. There was no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that would be repurchased. We reserved the right to modify or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
21 Table of Contents On November 6, 2014, the Board approved a $ 3.0
million increase to the Company’s 2012 stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company could continue to acquire shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time for an unspecified length of time. From the inception of the 2012 stock repurchase program on through its termination on May 12, 2022, we repurchased approximately
2,458,000
shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of approximately $ 4.3
million, at an average price per share of $ 1.73 . As of December 31, 2022, these repurchased shares had been retired and resumed their status as authorized and unissued shares of our common stock.
On May 12, 2022 the Board of Directors terminated the 2012 stock repurchase program and approved a new plan for the company to acquire up to $ 10.0  million of our outstanding common stock for an unspecified length of time. Under the program, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions and block trades, and may also repurchase shares pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan during our closed trading windows. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased. We may modify or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice. No shares were repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased
0.3  million shares, for an aggregate price of approximately $ 0.9  million, at an average price of $ 2.90
per share. As of December 31, 2022 approximately $ 9.1
million remained available for the repurchase of our common stock under our current program. 10. Business Segments The Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews the Company's results on a consolidated basis and our financial results are presented under a single reporting segment in order to provide the most accurate representation of Company's performance. 11. Long-Term Debt On January 25, 2022, Iteris, Inc., entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Capital One, National Association, as agent.
The Credit Agreement provided for a $ 20  million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of January 24, 2026.
In addition, the Company had the ability from time to time to increase the revolving commitments up to an additional aggregate amount not to exceed $ 40  million, subject to receipt of lender commitments and certain conditions precedent. The Credit Agreement that evidenced the facility contained customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default. The Credit Agreement was collateralized by substantially all of our property and assets, including intellectual property. The Credit Agreement also contained certain restrictions and covenants that required the Company to maintain, on an ongoing basis, (i) a leverage ratio of no greater than
3.00
to
1.00
and (ii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than
1.25
to
1.00 . The leverage ratio also determined the applicable interest rate under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrued interest at a rate equal to either Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or a specified base rate, at the Company’s option, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins ranged from
2.00 % to
2.80 % per annum for SOFR loans and
1.00 % to
1.80 % per annum for base rate loans. The revolving credit facility was subject to a commitment fee payable on the unused revolving credit facility commitments ranging from
0.25 % to
0.35 %, that was dependent on the Company’s leverage ratio. On September 12, 2022, the Company voluntarily terminated the Credit Agreement and expensed the remaining capitalized deferred financing costs. The Company had not borrowed against the Credit Agreement since its inception, but the Company continued to incur customary fees thereunder prior to this termination. In connection with the termination of the Credit Agreement, all liens securing such obligations and guarantees of such obligations were released.
Amortization of the deferred financing costs and commitment fees on the unused revolving credit facility commitments of $ 0.3  million are included in Interest Income (Expense), net on the unaudited condensed statement of operations. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts of capitalized deferred financing costs remained. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements This report, including the following discussion and analysis, contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and our industry, and reflect management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by us based upon information available to us as of the date of this report.

Overview General We are a provider of smart mobility infrastructure management solutions. Our cloud-enabled solutions help public transportation agencies, municipalities, commercial entities and other transportation infrastructure providers monitor, visualize, and optimize mobility infrastructure to make mobility safe, efficient, and sustainable for everyone. Recent Developments Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business The COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) has materially adversely impacted global economic conditions. COVID-19 continues to have an unpredictable and unprecedented impact on the global economy. Though there has been a trend of increasing availability of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions, infection rates continue to fluctuate and federal, state and local government regulations continue to rapidly change. The uncertainties caused by the Pandemic include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, workplace dislocations, economic contraction, and downward pressure on some customer budgets and customer sentiment in general. Due to the Pandemic, we have experienced supply chain and work delays on certain projects. Should such conditions continue or worsen or should longer-term budgets or priorities of our clients be impacted, the Pandemic could further negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the Pandemic on our business and financial results, and the volatility of our stock price will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the Pandemic, new and potentially more contagious variants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, the impact on capital and financial markets, the distribution, rate of adoption and efficacy of vaccines, and the related impact on the budgets and financial circumstances of our customers and suppliers, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of this report. Given the uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the Pandemic on the Company's future financial condition and results of operations, we have taken certain actions to preserve our liquidity, manage cash flow and strengthen our financial flexibility. Such actions include, but are not limited to, reducing discretionary spending, reducing capital expenditures, and implementing restructuring activities. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, for more information.
Our products require specialized parts which have become more difficult to source. In some cases, we have had to purchase such parts from third-party brokers at substantially higher prices. Additionally, to mitigate for component shortages, we have increased inventory levels. In the event demand doesn't materialize, we would need to hold excess inventory for several quarters. Alternatively, we may be unable to source sufficient components, even from third-party brokers, at any price, to meet customer demand, resulting in high levels of backlog that we were unable to ship. We have placed non-cancellable
23 Table of Contents inventory orders for certain products in advance of our normal lead times to secure normal and incremental future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.
Due to the supply chain environment, the Company increased inventory by approximately $4.5 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as part of the Company's supply chain strategy. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, inventory decreased from September 30, 2022 by a net $0.4 million and we had working capital of approximately $24.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The cash flow used in operating activities of our continuing operations was approximately $10.8 million, resulting in $2.8 million of cash provided by continuing operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Cash used during the fiscal year was primarily driven by the planned increase in inventory and the continued re-design of certain circuit boards as part of the Company’s supply chain strategy to help assure the Company has enough product to satisfy customer demand, and the net operating loss as a result of higher inventory component costs related to the global supply chain constraints. The Company's tactics to mitigate the current global supply chain issues included re-designing certain circuit boards to accommodate computer chips that are more readily available in the market at more reasonable prices, and by accumulating inventory in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2023. The increase in inventory purchases and in particular components purchased in the secondary markets has been curtailed, and the Company does not expect to continue to accumulate inventory in the future, in the same magnitude, in future periods. However, we might encounter additional supply-chain constraints in the future. If we do, the company may need to further adjust its operations to have sufficient liquidity. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act provides relief to U.S. corporations through financial assistance programs and modifications to certain income tax provisions. The Company applied certain beneficial provisions of the CARES Act, including the payroll tax deferral and the alternative minimum tax acceleration. Refer to Note 5, Income Taxes, for more information. The Pandemic has had an impact on the Company’s human capital. While our Santa Ana product and commercial operations facility has remained open throughout the Pandemic, easing of Pandemic restrictions imposed by local and state authorities has allowed a larger portion of our workforce to return to our various facilities while others continue to work remotely. The Company’s information technology infrastructure has proven sufficiently flexible to minimize disruptions in required duties and responsibilities.
Additionally, we have been able to timely file financial reports. We believe we have the infrastructure to efficiently work remotely during the Pandemic.
The Company assessed the impacts of the Pandemic on the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our unaudited condensed financial statements. The estimates and assumptions used in our assessments were based on management’s judgment and may be subject to change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the Pandemic and its resulting impact on global economic conditions. If economic conditions caused by the Pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management, the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially impacted. The Company will continue to assess the effect on its operations by monitoring the spread of the Pandemic and the actions implemented to combat the virus throughout the world. As a result, our assessment of the impact of the Pandemic may change. Climate Change We take climate change and the risks associated with climate change seriously. Increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events associated with climate change could adversely impact our facilities, interfere with intersection construction projects, and have a material impact on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. More extreme and volatile temperatures, increased storm intensity and flooding, and more volatile precipitation are among the weather events that are most likely to impact our business. We are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of these events.
However, we perform ongoing assessments of physical risk, including physical climate risk, to our business and efforts to mitigate these physical risks continue to be implemented on an ongoing basis.
As a global leader in smart mobility infrastructure management, our core business also aims to reduce climate impact through our work with public and private-sector partners to increase the efficiency of mobility, which has the benefit of reducing carbon emissions, all as part of our commitment to a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable future. By reducing delays and stops as part of traffic signal timing projects, improving the efficiency of public transit via signal priority programs, reducing time spent roadside for heavy-emitting commercial freight vehicles during inspection, to name just a few examples, our industry-leading portfolio of smart mobility infrastructure management solutions is currently helping cities and states to reduce their carbon footprint. Additionally, we continue to enhance the design of our sensors to withstand increasingly extreme weather conditions. 24 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, project loss reserves, executive severance and transition costs, and acquisition earnout payments (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was approximately $(0.4) million and $(8.0) million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to approximately $0.1 million and $5.5 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. When viewed with our financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and accompanying reconciliations, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides additional useful information to clarify and enhance the understanding of the factors and trends affecting our past performance and future prospects. We define these measures, explain how they are calculated and provide reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios, as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”), are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. They are not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as measures of our liquidity. The presentation of these measures should not be interpreted to mean that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We use Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP operating performance measures internally as complementary financial measures to evaluate the performance and trends of our businesses. We present Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios, as applicable, because we believe that measures such as these provide useful information with respect to our ability to meet our operating commitments. Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: • They do not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; • Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; • They are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; • They do not reflect the impact on earnings of charges resulting from matters unrelated to our ongoing operations; and • Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, whereby limiting its usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information. See our unaudited condensed financial statements contained in this Form 10-Q. However, in spite of the above limitations, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios are useful to an investor in evaluating our results of operations because these measures: • Are widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors; • Help investors to evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating performance; and • Are used by our management team for various other purposes including presentations to our Board of Directors as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. The following financial items have been added back to or subtracted from our net income when calculating Adjusted EBITDA: • Income tax.
This amount may be useful to investors because it represents the taxes that might be payable for the period and the change in deferred taxes during the period, and therefore could reduce cash flow available for use in our business. 25 Table of Contents • Depreciation expense.
Iteris excludes depreciation expense primarily because it is a non-cash expense. These amounts may be useful to investors because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations. • Amortization.
Iteris incurs amortization of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. Iteris also incurs amortization related to capitalized software development costs. Iteris excludes these items because it does not believe that these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts may be useful to investors because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of product rights. • Interest expense.
Iteris excludes interest expense because it does not believe this item is reflective of ongoing business and operating results. This amount may be useful to investors for determining current cash flow. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, interest expense includes amortization of the remaining capitalized deferred financing costs due to the termination of the Credit Agreement (see Note 11). • Stock-based compensation.
These expenses consist primarily of expenses from employee and director equity based compensation plans. Iteris excludes stock-based compensation primarily because they are non-cash expenses and Iteris believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of stock-based compensation to its results of operations and current cash flow. • Restructuring charges.
These expenses consist primarily of employee separation expenses, facility termination costs, and other expenses associated with Company restructuring activities. Iteris excludes these expenses as it does not believe that these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts may be useful to our investors in evaluating our core operating performance. • Project loss reserves.
These expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred to complete a software development contract that will not be recoverable and largely related to previously incurred and capitalized costs for non-recurring engineering activity. Iteris excludes these expenses as it does not believe that these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts may be useful to our investors in evaluating our core operating performance.
• Executive severance and transition costs.
Iteris excludes executive severance and transition costs because it does not believe that these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts may be useful to our investors in evaluating our core operating performance. • Acquisition earnout payments.
These expenses are a result of the TrafficCast International, Inc. acquisition in December, 2020 and are the final earnout payments per the acquisition agreement. Iteris excluded these expenses as it does not believe that these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts may be useful to our investors in evaluating our core operating performance. Reconciliations of net loss from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA and the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues were as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (In Thousands) (In Thousands) Net loss from continuing operations $ (2,049) $ (2,402) $ (14,311) $ (3,862) Income tax expense 27 375 149 201 Depreciation expense 153 203 461 629 Amortization expense 770 810 2,396 2,428 Interest expense — — 332 — Stock-based compensation 438 768 1,982 2,396 Other adjustments: Restructuring charges — — 707 — Project loss — — — 3,394 Executive severance and transition costs — 340 — 340 Acquisition earnout payments 248 — 248 — Adjusted EBITDA $ (413) $ 94 $ (8,036) $ 5,526 Percentage of total revenues (1.0) % 0.3  % (7.1) % 5.6  % 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" is based on our unaudited condensed financial statements included herein, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. In preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe are reasonable. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on a regular basis and apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, goodwill, and income taxes have the most potential impact on our financial statements. Historically, our estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.

Analysis of Quarterly Results from Continuing Operations The following table presents our total revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, $
Increase (decrease) % Change 2022 2021 (In thousands, except percentages) Product revenues $ 22,852  $ 15,870  $ 6,982  44.0  % Service revenues 17,834  16,134  1,700  10.5  % Total revenues $ 40,686  $ 32,004  $ 8,682  27.1  % Nine Months Ended December 31, $
Increase (decrease) % Change 2022 2021 (In thousands, except percentages) Product revenues $ 60,021  $ 51,632  $ 8,389  16.2  % Service revenues 53,591  47,704  5,887  12.3  % Total revenues $ 113,612  $ 99,336  $ 14,276  14.4  % Product revenues primarily consist of product sales, but also includes OEM products for the traffic signal markets, as well as third-party product sales for installation under certain construction-type contracts. Product revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 44% to $22.9 million, as compared to $15.9 million in the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to continued strong demand for our hardware solutions and our circuit board redesign efforts allowing us to ship more product.
Service revenues consist of software, managed services, systems integration, and consulting services revenues. In certain instances, the lack of product availability can impact the timing of systems integration projects and associated revenue recognition. Service revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 10.5% to $17.8 million, compared to $16.1 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. This increase was due to continued adoption of Iteris' ClearMobility Platform and increased software and managed services revenue. Total annual recurring revenue, which we define as all software and managed services revenue was 23% of total revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 25% of total revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 27.1% to $40.7 million, compared to $32.0 million in the corresponding period in the prior year due to the aforementioned reasons.
27 Table of Contents Product revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased 16.2% to $60.0 million, as compared to $51.6 million in the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to continued strong demand for our hardware solutions and our circuit board redesign efforts allowing us to ship more product in the current fiscal year. Service revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased 12.3% to $53.6 million, compared to $47.7 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. This increase was due to continued adoption of Iteris' ClearMobility Platform and increased software and managed services revenue. Total annual recurring revenue, which we define as all software and managed services revenue was 26% of total revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 25% of total revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Total revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased 14.4% to $113.6 million, compared to $99.3 million in the corresponding period in the prior year due to the aforementioned reasons.
We plan to continue to focus on securing new contracts and extending and/or continuing our existing relationships with both key public-sector and private-sector customers that have projects in their final project phases. While we believe our ability to obtain additional large contracts will contribute to overall revenue growth, the mix of subcontractor revenue and third-party product sales to our public-sector customers will likely affect the related total gross profit from period to period, as total revenues derived from subcontractors and third-party product sales generally have lower gross margins than revenues generated by our professional services. Backlog is an operational measure representing future unearned revenue amounts believed to be firm that are to be earned under our existing agreements and are not included in deferred revenue on our balance sheets. Backlog includes new bookings but does not include announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed. In many cases, backlog is less than the sum total contract value of all our customer agreements. We believe backlog is a useful metric for investors, given its relevance to total orders, but there can be no assurances we will recognize revenue from bookings or backlog timely or ever. Total backlog was approximately $112.2 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to approximately $92.3 million as of December 31, 2021. Gross Profit and Gross Margin The following tables present details of our gross profit and gross margin for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, $ Increase (decrease) %

The decline was primarily due to global supply chain constraints that prevented the Company from sourcing certain electronics components (most notably semiconductors) through traditional channels at normal prices. To maintain customer loyalty, increase market penetration, and build buffer stock to reduce future shipping disruptions, the Company sourced various components from electronics brokers (or aftermarket brokers) at elevated prices. Electronics brokers typically require buyers to pay upon receipt, whereas traditional sources offer standard payment terms. While this dynamic impacted working capital and cash flow in the prior periods, the Company saw improvement in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 upon the release of new circuit board designs that have qualified components from traditional supplier channels at more reasonable prices. The Company began shipping the new circuit board designs in the third quarter, which increased the product gross margins 2,640 basis points from 3.7% in the prior quarter.
Our service gross margin as a percentage of service revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately 700 basis points and increased approximately 170 basis points, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to timing of certain extension contracts, the contract mix, an increase in the amount of subcontractors on such contracts, and increased data costs on our SaaS platforms. Revenue generated from our subcontractors generally results in lower gross margins than revenue from direct labor. The increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the prior year period including a contractual loss with a customer of $3.4 million which was offset by a higher proportion of revenue from subcontractors and higher data costs in the current year. Our total gross margin as a percentage of total revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately 560 basis points and 1,150 basis points, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods due to the aforementioned reasons. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately 7.4% to $5.5 million, compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately 8.3% to $16.9 million, compared to $18.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 was due to cost savings associated with the prior restructuring activities as well as actions to decrease rent and outside services expenses. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 24.6% to $5.8 million compared to $4.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Sales and marketing expense for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 17.9% to $16.7 million compared to $14.1 million for the nine
months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was primarily due to the addition of sales and sales support representatives, resulting in higher compensation and benefit costs. Research and Development Expense Research and development expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 10.6% to $2.0 million, compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Research and development expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 16.7% to $6.4 million, compared to $5.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The overall increase was primarily due to the continued investment in research and development activities largely focused on improving our existing software related offerings and the re-design of certain circuit boards as part of the Company's supply chain management program.
We plan to continue to invest in the development of further enhancements and functionality of our Iteris ClearMobility Platform which includes among other things our software portfolio and our Vantage sensors. Certain development costs were capitalized into intangible assets in the unaudited condensed balance sheets in both the current and prior year periods; however, certain costs did not meet the criteria for capitalization under GAAP and are included in research and development expense. Going forward, we expect to continue to invest in our software solutions. This continued investment may result in increases in research and development costs, as well as additional capitalized software in future periods. 29 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets was approximately $0.7 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets was approximately $2.0 million and $2.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Income Taxes The effective tax rate used for interim periods is the estimated annual effective tax rate, based on our current estimate of full year results, except that taxes related to specific events, if any, are recorded in the interim period in which they occur. Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $0.0 million and $0.1 million, or (1.3)% and (1.1)%, respectively, of pre-tax loss, as compared with an expense of approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million, or (18.5)% and (5.5)%, respectively, of pre-tax loss for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we review all available positive and negative evidence, including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, potential carrybacks, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. As we have experienced a cumulative pre-tax loss over the trailing three years, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the Pandemic. The CARES Act contains numerous income tax provisions, such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The income tax provisions of the CARES Act had an immaterial impact on our current taxes, deferred taxes, and uncertain tax positions of the Company in the year ended March 31, 2022. The CARES Act also allows for the deferral of payroll taxes, as well as the immediate refund of federal Alternative Minimum Tax credits, which had previously been made refundable over a period of four years by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had repaid all amounts deferred under the CARES Act.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Outlook We believe we will have adequate liquidity over the next 12 months to operate our business and to meet our cash requirements. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $10.2 million. Additionally, the Company had working capital of approximately $24.7 million as of December 31, 2022. As a result of the Pandemic, we have taken and will continue to take action to reduce costs, preserve liquidity and manage our cash flow. Such actions include, but are not limited to reducing our discretionary spending, reducing capital expenditures, and reducing payroll costs, including employee furloughs, pay freezes and pay cuts as needed.
While the impact and duration of the Pandemic on our business is currently uncertain, the situation is expected to be temporary. The Company increased inventory by approximately $4.5 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which was a planned increase in inventory as part of the Company's supply chain management program. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, inventory decreased from September 30, 2022, by a net $0.4 million though the Company did replenish certain electronics components in the December 31, 2022 period to maintain buffer stock targets consistent with our supply chain management program.
The cash flow used in operating activities of our continuing operations was approximately $10.8 million year to date. The cash was used for the planned increase in inventory and the re-design of certain circuit boards as part of the Company’s supply chain management program, which is intended to assure the Company has enough product to satisfy customer demand. The net operating loss is a result of higher inventory component costs for product we shipped in the periods.
The Company's tactics to mitigate the current global supply chain issues included accumulating inventory in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2023 to reduce the risk of customer disruptions while our engineering teams re-design certain circuit boards to accommodate electronic components (primarily semiconductors) that are more readily available through traditional
30 Table of Contents sources at more normal prices. The Company does not expect to continue to accumulate inventory in the future in the same magnitude. However, we might encounter additional supply-chain constraints in the future. If we do, the Company may need to further adjust its operations to have sufficient liquidity. Cash Flows We have historically financed our operations with a combination of cash flows from operations and the sale of equity securities. We expect to continue to rely on cash flows from operations and our cash reserves to fund our operations, which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. However, we may need or choose to raise additional capital to fund potential future acquisitions and our future growth. We may raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors or by borrowing money from financial institutions. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution, and any equity securities that may be issued may have rights senior to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding on a timely basis, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. At December 31, 2022, we had $24.7 million in working capital, excluding current assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, which included $10.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. This compares to working capital of $36.8 million at March 31, 2022, excluding current assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, which included $23.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Operating Activities.
Net cash used in operating activities of our continuing operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $10.8 million was primarily the result of approximately $7.7 million from non-cash items, primarily for noncash lease expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation, and amortization. This was offset by our net loss from continuing operations of approximately $14.3 million coupled with approximately $4.2 million of outflows due to changes in working capital which was primarily driven by the planned increase in inventory as part of the Company's supply chain management program. The Company does not expect such a large increase in inventory in future periods. The efforts to redesign circuit boards around more readily available parts at lower prices has resulted in new circuit boards that commenced production during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with the aim of reducing purchases in the broker market at elevated prices and reducing cash outflows related to inventory purchases in future periods. The Company plans to redesign additional circuit boards in the future to lower the inventory costs; however, if such efforts are not successful, the Company may need to further adjust its operations to maintain sufficient liquidity.
Net cash used in operating activities of our continuing operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 of approximately $2.0 million was primarily the result of our net income of approximately $10.3 million in non-cash items, primarily for noncash lease expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation, and amortization. This was offset by our net loss from continuing operations of approximately $3.9 million. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations was $0.1 million. Investing Activities.
Net cash used in investing activities of our continuing operations during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $1.5 million was primarily the result of approximately $0.5 million of property and equipment purchases, and approximately $1.0 million of capitalized software development costs. Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was de minimis. Net cash provided by investing activities of our continuing operations during the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of approximately $3.1 million in proceeds from the sale and maturity of short-term investments offset by approximately $0.3 million of property and equipment purchases, and approximately $1.3 million of capitalized software development costs. Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was approximately $1.5 million. Financing Activities.
Net cash used in financing activities of our continuing operations during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was the result of approximately $0.9 million of repurchases of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities of our continuing operations during the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was the result of approximately $1.3 million and $0.2 million of cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options and purchase of ESPP shares, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2022. 31 Table of Contents Seasonality We have historically experienced seasonality, which adversely affects product sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters due to a reduction in intersection construction and repairs during the winter months due to inclement weather conditions, with the third fiscal quarter generally affected the most by inclement weather. We have also experienced seasonality, particularly with respect to our service revenues, especially in the third fiscal quarter due to the increased number of holidays, causing a reduction in available billable hours. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by Item 305 of Regulations S-K. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such controls and procedures. Changes in Internal Controls During the fiscal quarter covered by this report, there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Internal Controls A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of management override or improper acts, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to management override, error or improper acts may occur and not be detected. Any resulting misstatement or loss may have an adverse and material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 32 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Not applicable. Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities Not applicable. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer On August 9, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we could acquire up to $3 million of our outstanding common stock for an unspecified length of time. Under the program, we could repurchase shares from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions and block trades, and could also repurchase shares pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan during our closed trading windows. There was no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that would be repurchased. We reserved the right to modify or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
On November 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $3.0 million increase to the Company’s 2012 stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company could continue to acquire shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time for an unspecified length of time. From inception of the 2012 stock repurchase program through its termination on May 12, 2022, we repurchased approximately 2,458,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of approximately $4.3 million, at an average price per share of $1.73. As of December 31, 2022, these repurchased shares had been retired and returned to their status as authorized and unissued shares of our common stock.
On May 12, 2022 the Board of Directors terminated the 2012 stock repurchase program and approved a new plan for the company to acquire up to $10.0 million of our outstanding common stock for an unspecified length of time. Under the program, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions and block trades, and may also repurchase shares pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan during our closed trading windows. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased. We may modify or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2022, we have repurchased 0.3 million shares for an aggregate price of approximately $0.9 million, at an average price of $2.90 per share. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $9.1 million remained available for the repurchase of our common stock under our current program. No shares were repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2022. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5.
