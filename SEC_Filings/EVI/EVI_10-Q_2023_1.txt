Table of Contents   EVI Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 (Unaudited)
Note (1) - General:
The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EVI Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”).
All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
for interim financial statements and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X related to interim period financial
statements. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include certain information and
footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. However, in management’s opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) which are necessary
in order to state fairly the Company’s results of operations, financial position, shareholders’ equity and cash flows as of
and for the periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year or any other future period. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, including the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The June 30, 2022 balance
sheet information contained herein was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of that date included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
The preparation of the Company’s unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The estimates and assumptions made may not prove to be correct,
and actual results could differ from the estimates.
The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
is a value-added distributor, and provides advisory and technical services. Through its vast sales organization, the Company provides
its customers with planning, designing, and consulting services related to their commercial laundry operations. The Company sells and/or
leases its customers commercial laundry equipment, specializing in washing, drying, finishing, material handling, water heating, power
generation, and water reuse applications. In support of the suite of products it offers, the Company sells related parts and accessories.
Additionally, through the Company’s robust network of commercial laundry technicians, the Company provides its customers with installation,
maintenance, and repair services.
The Company’s customers include government,
institutional, industrial, commercial and retail customers. Product purchases made by customers range from parts and accessories, to single
or multiple units of equipment, to large complex systems. The Company also provides its customers with the services described above.
The Company’s growth strategy includes organic
growth initiatives and business acquisitions pursuant to the Company’s “buy-and-build” growth strategy.

Table of Contents   EVI Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 (Unaudited)
Note (2) – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies:
There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies from those described in Note
2 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Note (3) – Recently Issued Accounting
Guidance : In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU
2016-13”), which will change the way companies evaluate credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For
trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other specified instruments, entities will be required to use
a new forward-looking “expected loss” model to evaluate impairment, potentially resulting in earlier recognition of allowances
for losses. The new standard will also require enhanced disclosures, including the requirement to disclose the information used to track
credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables. The guidance must be applied using a cumulative-effect transition
method. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and for interim periods within those fiscal years
(the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024 for the Company), with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
that adopting this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.
Other than as described above, management does
not believe that accounting standards and updates which have been issued but are not yet effective will have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
Note (4) – Acquisitions:
On September 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisitions of Aldrich Clean-Tech Equipment Corp. (“ACT”), a Massachusetts-based distributor of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry, and K&B Laundry Service, LLC (“K&B”), a North Carolina-based distributor of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry. The total consideration for these two acquisitions consisted of approximately $ 1.2
million in cash, net of cash acquired, which the Company funded through borrowings under its credit facility. Fees and expenses related to these acquisitions, consisting primarily of legal and other professional fees, totaled approximately $ 102,000
and are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. Each acquisition was treated for accounting purposes as a purchase of the acquired business using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), pursuant to which the consideration paid by the Company was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, in each case, based on their respective fair values as of the closing date, with the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired being allocated to intangible assets and goodwill. The Company allocated a total of $ 639,000
to goodwill, which is expected to be amortized and deductible for tax purposes over
15
years. Goodwill is attributable primarily to the assembled workforces, as well as the expected benefits from the increased scale of the Company as a result of these acquisitions.
On November 1, 2022, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Wholesale Commercial Laundry Equipment Company SE, LLC (“WCL”), an Alabama-based distributor of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry. In connection with the transaction, the Company also assumed certain of the liabilities of WCL. The consideration paid by the Company in connection with the acquisition consisted of $ 650,000
in cash and
24,243
shares of the Company’s common stock, with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $ 503,000 . Fees and expenses related to the acquisition, consisting primarily of legal and other professional fees, totaled approximately $ 31,000
and are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. The acquisition was treated for accounting purposes as a purchase of the acquired business using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, pursuant to which the consideration paid by the Company was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, in each case, based on their respective fair values as of the closing date, with the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired being allocated to goodwill. The Company allocated $ 1,034,000
to goodwill, which is expected to be amortized and deductible for tax purposes over
15
years. Goodwill is attributable primarily to the assembled workforce, as well as the expected benefits from the increased scale of the Company as a result of the acquisition.

Note (5) - Earnings Per Share:
The Company
computes earnings per share using the two-class method. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an earnings allocation
formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and any participating securities according to dividends declared (whether
paid or unpaid) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Shares of the Company’s common stock subject to unvested restricted
stock awards and restricted stock units are considered participating securities because they contain a non-forfeitable right to cash dividends
(in the case of restricted stock awards) or dividend equivalents (in the case of restricted stock units) paid prior to vesting or forfeiture,
if any, irrespective of whether the awards or units ultimately vest. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the six and three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are computed as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

On November 2, 2018, the Company entered into
a syndicated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a
five -year revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate
principal amount of up to $ 100
million, with an accordion feature to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $ 40
million for a
total of $ 140
million. A portion of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans of up to a sublimit of $ 5
million and
for the issuance of standby letters of credit of up to a sublimit of $ 10
million.
Prior to the amendment described below, borrowings
(other than swingline loans) under the Credit Agreement accrued interest at a rate, at the Company’s election at the time of borrowing,
equal to (a)
LIBOR plus a margin that ranged from 1.25% to 1.75% depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, which is
a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (the
“Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) or (b) the highest of (i) prime, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii)
the one month LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, plus a margin that ranged from 0.25% to 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
Swingline loans accrued interest calculated at the base rate determined in accordance with clause (b) of the preceding sentence plus a
margin that ranged from 0.25% to 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
The Credit Agreement had an initial term of
five
years
with a scheduled maturity date of
November 2, 2023 .
On May 6, 2022, the Company entered into an
amendment to the Credit Agreement. The amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date from
November
2, 2023
to
May 6, 2027
and, in connection with the phasing out of LIBOR, replace LIBOR with the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index
rate (the “BSBY rate”). As a result, borrowings (other than swingline loans) under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at
a rate, at the Company’s election at the time of borrowing, equal to (a)
the BSBY rate plus a margin that ranges between 1.25% and
1.75% depending on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio or (b) the highest of (i) prime, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50
basis points, and (iii) the BSBY rate plus 100 basis points (such highest rate, the “Base Rate”), plus a margin that ranges
between 0.25% and 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Swingline loans generally bear interest at the Base Rate plus a
margin that ranges between 0.25% and 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
financial covenants requiring the Company to comply with maximum leverage ratios and minimum interest coverage ratios. The Credit Agreement
also contains other provisions which may restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, dispose of or acquire assets or
businesses, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares and enter
into transactions with affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with its covenants under the Credit Agreement and
$ 38.8
million was available to borrow under the revolving credit facility.
The obligations of the Company under the Credit
Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, and are guaranteed, jointly and
severally, by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries.

Company as Lessor
The Company derives a portion of its revenue from
equipment leasing arrangements. Such arrangements provide for monthly payments covering the equipment provided, maintenance, and interest.
These arrangements meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales type leases. Accordingly, revenue from the provision of the equipment
is recognized upon delivery of the equipment and its acceptance by the customer. Upon the recognition of such revenue, an asset is established
for the investment in sales type leases. Maintenance revenue and interest are recognized monthly over the lease term.

Note (8) - Income Taxes:
Income taxes
are recorded in the Company’s quarterly financial statements based on the Company’s estimated annual effective income tax
rate, subject to adjustment for discrete events, should they occur.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022,
the Company had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $ 4.8
million and $ 4.7
million, respectively. Consistent with the guidance
of the FASB regarding accounting for income taxes, the Company regularly estimates its ability to recover deferred tax assets and establishes
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the balance to amounts expected to be recoverable. This evaluation includes
the consideration of several factors, including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods
over which temporary differences reverse, the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, past and projected taxable income, and available
tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2022, management believed that it was more-likely-than-not that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net amount of the Company’s deferred tax assets over the periods during which
temporary differences reverse.

Company Overview
EVI Industries, Inc., through its wholly-owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), is a value-added distributor, and provides advisory and technical services. Through
its vast sales organization, the Company provides its customers with planning, designing, and consulting services related to their commercial
laundry operations. The Company sells and/or leases its customers commercial laundry equipment, specializing in washing, drying, finishing,
material handling, water heating, power generation, and water reuse applications. In support of the suite of products it offers, the Company
sells related parts and accessories. Additionally, through the Company’s robust network of commercial laundry technicians, the Company
provides its customers with installation, maintenance, and repair services.
The Company’s customers include government,
institutional, industrial, commercial and retail customers. Product purchases made by customers range from parts and accessories, to single
or multiple units of equipment, to large complex systems. The Company also provides its customers with the services described above.
The Company’s operating expenses consist
primarily of (a) selling, general and administrative expenses, which are comprised primarily of salaries, and commissions and marketing
expenses that are variable and correlate to changes in sales, (b) expenses related to the operation of warehouse facilities, including
a fleet of installation and service vehicles, and facility rent, which are payable mostly under non-cancelable operating leases, and (c)
operating expenses at the parent company, including compensation expenses, fees for professional services, other expenses associated with
being a public company, and expenses in furtherance of the Company’s “buy-and-build” growth strategy.
21
Table of Contents
Growth Strategy
During 2015, the Company
implemented a “buy-and-build” growth strategy. The “buy” component of the strategy includes the
consideration and pursuit of acquisitions and other strategic transactions which management believes would complement the
Company’s existing business or otherwise offer growth opportunities for, or benefit, the Company. The Company generally seeks
to structure acquisitions to include both cash and stock consideration. Acquisitions are effected through a wholly-owned subsidiary
which acquires the business or assets of the acquired company, whether by an asset purchase or merger, and operates the acquired
business following the transaction. In connection with each transaction, the Company, indirectly through its applicable wholly-owned
subsidiary, also assumes certain of the liabilities of the acquired business. The financial position, including assets and
liabilities, and results of operations of the acquired businesses following the respective closing dates of the acquisitions are
included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As described in greater detail in Note 4 to the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, on September 1, 2022, the
Company acquired Aldrich Clean-Tech Equipment Corp. (“ACT”), a Massachusetts-based distributor of commercial,
industrial, and vended laundry products and provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of
the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry, and K&B Laundry Service, LLC (“K&B”), a North
Carolina-based distributor of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and provider of installation and maintenance
services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry. The financial condition and
results of operations of ACT and K&B subsequent to the September 1, 2022 closing date of such acquisitions are included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. In addition, as also
described in Note 4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, on November 1, 2022, the Company acquired Wholesale Commercial Laundry Equipment Company SE, LLC, (“WCL”), an
Alabama-based distributor of commercial laundry products and a provider of related technical installation and maintenance services
to the on-premise and vended laundry segments of the commercial laundry industry. The financial condition and results of operations
of WCL subsequent to the November 1, 2022 closing date of such acquisition is included in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.
The “build” component
of the Company’s “buy-and-build” growth strategy involves implementing a growth culture at acquired businesses based
on the exchange of ideas and business concepts among the management teams of the Company and the acquired businesses as well as through
certain initiatives, which may include investments in additional sales and service personnel, new product lines, enhanced service operations
and capabilities, new and improved facilities, and advanced technologies.
The Company pursues market share
growth using a variety of strategies aimed at increasing the installed base of the wide range of commercial laundry equipment the Company
represents. Certain market share growth tactics may, from time to time, result in lower gross margins. However, the Company believes that
a greater installed base of equipment strengthens the Company’s existing customer relationships and may lead to increases in the
total number of customers, consequently creating a larger and stronger customer base to which the Company may sell products and services.
These may include the sale or provision of certain higher margin products and services and any additional products and services which
the Company may offer or sell from time to time as a result of any business acquisitions, the sale or lease of complementary products,
and expansion of its service operations. From time to time, the Company also enters into longer-term contracts, including to fulfill large
complex laundry projects for divisions of the federal government, where the nature of, and competition for, such contracts may result
in a lower gross margin as compared to other equipment sales. Despite the potential for a lower gross margin from such longer-term contracts,
the Company believes that the long-term benefit from the increase in its installed equipment will outweigh the possible short-term impact
to gross margin.
22
Table of Contents
Further, as a value-added distributor and a provider
of technical services in the commercial laundry industry, the Company partners with its customers to plan, design, install, and maintain
their commercial laundry operations. The nature of the Company’s business not only requires an experienced and well-trained sales
organization to procure customer orders, but also requires proper, timely, and cost-effective installation ranging from single units of
equipment to complex multimillion dollar laundry systems. Such installations also require coordination and collaboration with the Company’s
customers and any third parties they may retain. Consequently, the recognition of revenue and profit may from time to time be impacted
by delays in construction and/or the preparation of customer facilities for the installation of purchased commercial laundry equipment
and systems. This may result in decreased revenue and profit in a current period but a source of future revenue and profit through the
ultimate fulfillment of the orders.
Impact of COVID-19 on the
Company’s Business
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the
Company’s business and results, including sales and gross margin. Specifically, beginning at the end of the quarter ended March
31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic disruption caused delays and declines in the placement of customer orders, the
completion of equipment and parts installations, and the fulfillment of parts orders. Factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that
impacted the Company’s business and results may also in the future have adverse impacts. These factors include, but are not limited
to: supply chain disruptions, which resulted in, and may continue to result in, delays in delivering products or services to the Company’s
customers as well as increases in product costs; labor shortages and increases in the costs of labor; limitations on the ability of the
Company’s employees to perform their work due to sickness or other impacts caused by the pandemic or local, state, federal or foreign
orders that may restrict the Company’s operations or the operations of its customers, or require that employees be quarantined;
limitations on the ability of carriers to deliver products to the Company’s facilities and customers; risks associated with vaccine
mandates, including the potential loss of employees, fines for noncompliance and loss of, or future inability to secure, certain contracts,
including with the federal government; adverse impacts of the pandemic on certain industries and customers of the Company which operate
in those industries, including the hospitality industry; and potential decreased demand for products and services, including potential
limitations on the ability of, or adverse changes in the desire of, the Company’s customers to conduct their business, purchase
products and services, and pay for purchases on a timely basis or at all. Further, the Company may continue to experience adverse impacts
to its business as a result of, among other things, any adverse impact that has occurred or may occur in the future in the economy or
markets generally, and changes in customer or supplier behavior.

Table of Contents
Revenues
Revenues for the six and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 increased
$41.6 million, or 33%, and $21.9 million, or 36%, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increases in
revenue are primarily attributable to continued improved conditions in connection with the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic during
the six and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and the completion during the six and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022
of customers projects previously delayed by the pandemic. Additionally, the increase in revenues was partially attributable to price increases
established throughout the Company’s product lines and service offerings aimed at maintaining or increasing margins to cover incremental
product and operating cost increases, as well as the revenues generated by the businesses acquired by the Company during fiscal 2022 (primarily
Consolidated Laundry Equipment, Inc. and Central Equipment Company, LLC, which were acquired during February 2022) and the six months
ended December 31, 2022, as described under “Growth Strategy” above and in greater detail in Note 4 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the six and three-month periods
ended December 31, 2022 increased $14.9 million, or 43%, and $8.0 million, or 48%, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior
fiscal year. The increases were primarily the result of increased revenues and more favorable product and customer mix. The increases
were also attributable to the Company’s efforts to drive higher margin sales opportunities from promoting solution selling as a
value-added distributor. This resulted in an increase in gross margins from 27.7% for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 to
29.7% for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 and from 27.7% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 to 30.0% for
the three-month period ended December 31, 2022.
Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses
Operating expenses increased by
approximately $10.5 million, or 34%, and $5.3 million, or 34%, for the six and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively,
compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. These increases are primarily attributable to (a) operating expenses of acquired
businesses, including additional operating expenses at the acquired businesses in pursuit of future growth and in connection with the
Company’s optimization initiatives, (b) increases in selling costs, including commissions, from increases in revenues during the
six and three-month periods ended December 31, 2022, as described above, (c) increases in payroll and related fees, and (d) increases
in depreciation, amortization and stock compensation.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense for the six and three-month
periods ended December 31, 2022 was $1.0 million and $625,000, respectively, compared to $265,000 and $150,000 for the six and three-month
periods ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The increases in interest expense were attributable primarily to increases in the average
outstanding debt balance and average effective interest rate incurred on outstanding borrowings.
Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate was 27.8% and 26.3% for the six and
three-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to 24.5% and 35.7% for the six and three-month periods ended December
31, 2021, respectively. For the six-month period ended, the increases in the effective tax rate are attributable to an increase in the
net impact of permanent book-tax differences resulting primarily from nondeductible compensation. For the three-month period ended, the
decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to a decrease in the net impact of the book-tax differences resulting primarily from
the nondeductible compensation.
Net Income
Net income for the six and three-months ended
December 31, 2022 was $5.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, compared to net income of $2.5 million and $528,000 for the six and
three-month periods ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The increases in net income were attributable primarily to the increases in
revenue and the resulting gross profit, partially offset by the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and interest
expense, all as described in further detail above.

Consolidated Financial Condition
The Company’s total assets increased from $230.8 million at June 30,
2022 to $246.7 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to an increase in current assets,
including inventory and contract assets, as described below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Working Capital.” The
Company’s total liabilities increased from $113.1 million at June 30, 2022 to $122.0 million at December 31, 2022, which was primarily
attributable to an increase in customer deposits and long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in contract liabilities. The increase
in long-term debt was attributable to borrowings under the Company’s credit facility in excess of optional repayments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, cash increased by approximately
$409,000 compared to a decrease of approximately $53,000 during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s primary
sources of cash are sales and borrowings under its credit facility. The Company’s primary uses of cash are purchases of the products
sold by the Company, employee related costs, and the cash consideration paid in connection with business acquisitions.
Working Capital
Working capital increased from $30.8 million at June 30, 2022 to $45.6
million at December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting increases in inventory and contract assets, partially offset by decreases in accounts
receivable and increases in customer deposits. The increase in inventory was primarily due to warehousing of inventory for fulfillment
of contractual orders where either the customer is not ready to receive delivery of the product or only partial orders have been received
from manufacturers as a result of continued supply chain constraints, as well as increases in product costs. The increase in contract
assets is due in large part to the progress of certain large complex laundry projects for divisions of the federal government. The decrease
in accounts receivable is due to increased collection efforts and timing of receipt of payments from customers. The increase in customer
deposits was due primarily to a greater number of new jobs that had deposits received during the period than jobs that were completed.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flow activity for
the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):

Table of Contents
Operating Activities
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, operating activities used cash
of $4.9 million compared to $1.0 million of cash used by operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2021. This $3.9
million increase in cash used by operating activities was primarily attributable to changes in working capital offset by an increase in
net income. The changes in working capital include increases in cash used from operating activities from changes in operating assets such
as inventories and contract assets, and from changes in operating liabilities such as accounts payable and accrued expenses and customer
deposits, partially offset by decreases to the cash used by operating activities from changes in operating assets such as accounts receivable
and from changes in operating liabilities such as contract liabilities and accrued employee expenses.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased
$1.7 million to $3.7 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $2.0 million during the six months ended December
31, 2021. This $1.7 million increase was attributable primarily to an increase in cash used in connection with acquisitions, partially
offset by a decrease in capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
For the six months ended December 31, 2022,
financing activities provided cash of $9.0 million compared to $2.9 million of cash provided by financing activities during the six months
ended December 31, 2021. The $6.1 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was attributable to proceeds from borrowings
during the six months ended December 31, 2022 in excess of optional debt payments to fund changes in working capital and acquisitions.
Revolving Credit Agreement
On November 2, 2018, the Company entered into
a syndicated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a five-year revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate
principal amount of up to $100 million, with an accordion feature to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $40 million for a
total of $140 million. A portion of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans of up to a sublimit of $5 million and
for the issuance of standby letters of credit of up to a sublimit of $10 million.
Prior to the amendment described below, borrowings
(other than swingline loans) under the Credit Agreement accrued interest at a rate, at the Company’s election at the time of borrowing,
equal to (a) LIBOR plus a margin that ranged from 1.25% to 1.75% depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, which is
a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (the
“Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) or (b) the highest of (i) prime, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii)
the one month LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, plus a margin that ranged from 0.25% to 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
Swingline loans accrued interest calculated at the base rate determined in accordance with clause (b) of the preceding sentence plus a
margin that ranged from 0.25% to 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio. The Credit Agreement had an initial term of five
years with a scheduled maturity date of November 2, 2023.
On May 6, 2022, the Company entered into an
amendment to the Credit Agreement. The amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date from November
2, 2023 to May 6, 2027 and, in connection with the phasing out of LIBOR, replace LIBOR with the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index
rate (the “BSBY rate”). As a result, borrowings (other than swingline loans) under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at
a rate, at the Company’s election at the time of borrowing, equal to (a) the BSBY rate plus a margin that ranges between 1.25% and
1.75% depending on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio or (b) the highest of (i) prime, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50
basis points, and (iii) the BSBY rate plus 100 basis points (such highest rate, the “Base Rate”), plus a margin that ranges
between 0.25% and 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Swingline loans generally bear interest at the Base Rate plus a
margin that ranges between 0.25% and 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
26
Table of Contents
The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
financial covenants requiring the Company to comply with maximum leverage ratios and minimum interest coverage ratios. The Credit Agreement
also contains other provisions which may restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, dispose of or acquire assets or
businesses, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares and enter
into transactions with affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with its covenants under the Credit Agreement and
$38.8 million was available to borrow under the revolving credit facility.
The obligations of the Company under the Credit
Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, and are guaranteed, jointly and
severally, by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries.
The Company believes that its existing cash,
anticipated cash from operations and funds available under the Company’s Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operations
and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and thereafter. The Company may also seek to raise funds through
the issuance of equity and/or debt securities or the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured indebtedness, including in connection
with acquisitions or other transactions pursued by the Company as part of its “buy-and-build” growth strategy.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing
The Company had no off-balance sheet financing
arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K at December 31, 2022.
Inflation
Inflation did not have a significant effect on the
Company’s results during any of the reported periods. However, the Company faces risks relating to inflation, including the current
inflationary trend, which may have an adverse impact on the market for the Company’s products and services, including that there
is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively increase the price of its products and services to offset increased costs.

Each lease has an initial term of three years and provides for three successive three-year renewal terms at the option of the Company.
Payments under these leases totaled approximately $120,000 and $60,000 during the six and three months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
Critical Accounting Policies
In connection with the preparation of its financial
statements, the Company makes estimates and assumptions, including those that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent
assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Estimates and assumptions made may not prove to be correct,
and actual results may differ from the estimates. The accounting policies that the Company has identified as critical to its business
operations and to an understanding of the Company’s financial statements remain unchanged from those described in the “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Recently Issued Accounting Guidance
See Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued accounting guidance.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
The Company’s indebtedness subjects the
Company to interest rate risk. Interest rates are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign,
and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The nature and timing
of any changes in such policies or general economic conditions and the effect they may have on the Company are unpredictable. The Company’s
indebtedness may also have other important impacts on the Company, including that the Company will be required to utilize cash flow to
service the debt, indebtedness may make the Company more vulnerable to economic downturns, and the Company’s indebtedness subjects
the Company to covenants and may place restrictions on its operations and activities, including its ability to pay dividends and take
certain other actions. As described above, interest on borrowings under the Company’s Credit Agreement accrue at a rate, at the
Company’s election at the time of borrowing, equal to (a) the BSBY rate plus a margin that ranged from 1.25% to 1.75% depending
on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, which is a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (the “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) or (b) the highest of (i) prime,
(ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) the BSBY rate plus 100 basis points, plus a margin that ranged from 0.25%
to 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $37.0 million of outstanding
borrowings under the Credit Agreement with a weighted average interest rate of 5.37%. Based on the amount outstanding at December 31,
2022, a hypothetical 1% increase in daily interest rates would increase the Company’s annual interest expense by approximately $370,000.

All of the Company’s export sales require
the customer to make payment in United States dollars. Accordingly, foreign sales may be affected by the strength of the United States
dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which the Company’s customers are located, as well as the strength of the
economies of the countries in which the Company’s customers are located. The Company has, at times in the past, paid certain suppliers
in Euros. The Company had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022.
The Company’s cash is maintained in bank
accounts which bear interest at prevailing interest rates. At December 31, 2022, bank deposits exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
limits.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management of the Company, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on that
evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the
Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. It should be noted that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth
in the Company’s periodic reports.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022,
there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company is involved in, or
subject to, legal and regulatory claims, proceedings, demands or actions arising in the ordinary course of business. There have been no
material changes with respect to such matters from the disclosure included in the “Legal Proceedings” section of the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
There have been no material changes in the risk factors
that the Company faces from those disclosed in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds
The Company does not
have in place any formal share repurchase plans or programs. Upon request by a recipient of awards granted under the Company’s equity
incentive plan, the Company may issue shares upon the vesting of restricted stock awards or restricted stock units or the grant of stock
awards net of the statutory tax withholding requirements that the Company pays on behalf of its employees. For financial statement purposes,
the shares withheld are treated as being repurchased by the Company and are reflected as repurchases in the Company’s condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows and shareholders’ equity as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued.
The following table provides information concerning shares of the Company’s common stock treated as repurchased during the quarter
ended December 31, 2022 in connection with the issuance of shares upon the vesting of restricted stock awards or restricted stock units
or the grant of stock awards net of statutory tax withholding requirements:
