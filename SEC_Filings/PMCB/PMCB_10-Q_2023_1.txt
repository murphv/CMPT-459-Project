PHARMACYTE BIOTECH, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1 –
NATURE OF BUSINESS
PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc. (“Company”)
is a biotechnology company focused on developing cellular therapies for cancer, diabetes and malignant ascites based upon a proprietary
cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology known as “Cell-in-a-Box ® .” The Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology is intended to be used as a platform upon which therapies for several types of cancer, including locally advanced, inoperable
pancreatic cancer (“LAPC”) will be developed. The current generation of the Company’s product candidate is referred
to as “CypCaps™.”
The Company is a Nevada corporation incorporated
in 1996. In 2013, the Company restructured its operations to focus on biotechnology. The Company acquired licenses from SG Austria Pte.
Ltd., a Singapore corporation (“SG Austria”) to treat cancer and Austrianova Singapore Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation
(“Austrianova Singapore”) to treat diabetes using the Cell-in-the-Box technology. The restructuring resulted in the Company
focusing all its efforts upon the development of a novel, effective and safe way to treat cancer and diabetes. In January 2015, the Company
changed its name from Nuvilex, Inc. to PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc. to reflect the nature of its current business. In October 2021, the Company
moved its headquarters from Laguna Hills, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
On September 1, 2020, the Company submitted an
Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for a planned
clinical trial in LAPC. On October 1, 2020, the Company received notice from the FDA that it had placed the IND on clinical hold. On October
30, 2020, the FDA sent a letter to the Company setting forth the reasons for the clinical hold and specific guidance on what the Company
must do to have the clinical hold lifted.
To lift the clinical hold, the FDA informed the
Company that it needs to conduct several additional preclinical studies. The FDA also requested additional information regarding several
topics, including DNA sequencing data, manufacturing information and product release specifications. The Company has been in the process
of conducting these studies and gathering additional information to submit to the FDA. See “Investigational New Drug Application
and Clinical Hold” below.
On August 15, 2022, the Company entered into a
Cooperation Agreement (“Cooperation Agreement”) with Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. and its affiliates, pursuant to which the Company
elected a reconstituted Board of Directors (”Board”). The Board has formed a Business Review Committee to evaluate, investigate
and review the Company’s business, affairs, strategy, management and operations and in its sole discretion to make recommendations
to the Company’s management and Board with respect thereto. The Business Review Committee is also reviewing many of the risks relative
to the Company’s business. In addition, the Board is reviewing the Company’s development programs and its relationship with
SG Austria, including that all licensed patents have expired, that know-how relating to the Company’s Cell-in-a-Box® technology
solely resides with SG Austria, and that the incentives of SG Austria and its management may not be currently aligned with those of the
Company. The Board has curtailed spending on the Company’s programs, including pre-clinical and clinical activities, until the review
by the Business Review Committee and the Board is complete and the Board has determined the actions and plans to be implemented. The Business
Review Committee’s recommendations will include potentially seeking a new framework for the Company’s relationship with SG
Austria and its subsidiaries. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in seeking an acceptable new framework, the Company will reevaluate
whether it should continue those programs which are dependent on SG Austria, including its development programs for LAPC, diabetes and
malignant ascites. The issues involving SG Austria have delayed the Company’s timeline for addressing the FDA clinical hold for
its planned clinical trial in LAPC and could result in other delays or termination of the development activities. In addition, the curtailment
of spending on the Company’s programs pending the review by the Business Review Committee and the Board may cause additional delays.
The Cell-in-a-Box ®
encapsulation
technology potentially enables genetically engineered live human cells to be used as a means to produce various biologically active molecules.
The technology is intended to result in the formation of pinhead sized cellulose-based porous capsules in which genetically modified live
human cells can be encapsulated and maintained. In a laboratory setting, this proprietary live cell encapsulation technology has been
shown to create a micro-environment in which encapsulated cells survive and flourish. They are protected from environmental challenges,
such as the sheer forces associated with bioreactors and passage through catheters and needles, which the Company believes enables greater
cell growth and production of the active molecules. The capsules are largely composed of cellulose (cotton) and are bioinert.
9
The Company has been developing therapies for
pancreatic and other solid cancerous tumors by using genetically engineered live human cells that it believes are capable of converting
a cancer prodrug into its cancer-killing form. The Company encapsulates those cells using the Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology
and places those capsules in the body as close as possible to the tumor. In this way, the Company believes that when a cancer prodrug
is administered to a patient with a particular type of cancer that may be affected by the prodrug, the killing of the patient’s
cancerous tumor may be optimized.
The Company has also been developing a way to
delay the production and accumulation of malignant ascites that results from many types of abdominal cancerous tumors. The Company’s
therapy for malignant ascites involves using the same encapsulated cells it employs for pancreatic cancer but placing the encapsulated
cells in the peritoneal cavity of a patient and administering ifosfamide intravenously.
In addition to the two cancer programs discussed
above, the Company has been working on ways to exploit the benefits of the Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology to develop therapies
for cancer that involve prodrugs based upon certain constituents of the
Cannabis
plant. However, until the FDA allows us to commence
our clinical trial in LAPC and we are able to validate our Cell-in-a-Box ®
encapsulation technology in a clinical trial,
we are not spending any further resources developing our Cannabis Program.
Finally, the Company has been developing a potential
therapy for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. The Company’s product candidate for the treatment of diabetes
consists of encapsulated genetically modified insulin-producing cells. The encapsulation will be done using the Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology. Implanting these encapsulated cells in the body is designed to have them function as a bio-artificial pancreas for purposes
of insulin production.
Until the review by the Business Review Committee
and the Board is complete and the Board has determined the actions and plans to be implemented, spending on the Company’s programs
has been curtailed.
Investigational New Drug Application and
Clinical Hold
On September 1, 2020, the Company submitted an
IND to the FDA for a planned clinical trial in LAPC. On October 1, 2020, the Company received notice from the FDA that it had placed the
Company’s IND on clinical hold. On October 30, 2020, the FDA sent the Company a letter setting forth the reasons for the clinical
hold and providing specific guidance on what the Company must do to have the clinical hold lifted.
In order to address the clinical hold, the FDA requested that the Company:
·
Provide additional sequencing data and genetic stability studies;
·
Conduct a stability study on ‌the Company’s final formulated product candidate as well as the cells from the Company’s Master Cell Bank;
·
Evaluate the compatibility of the delivery devices (the prefilled syringe and the microcatheter used to implant the CypCaps ™ ) with ‌the Company’s product candidate for pancreatic cancer;
·
Provide additional detailed description of the manufacturing process of ‌the Company’s product candidate for pancreatic cancer;
10
·
Provide additional product release specifications for the Company’s encapsulated cells;
·
Demonstrate comparability between the 1 st
and 2 nd
generation of ‌the Company’s product candidate for pancreatic cancer and ensure adequate and consistent product performance and safety between the two generations;
·
Conduct a biocompatibility assessment using the Company’s capsules material;
·
Address specified insufficiencies in the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls information in the cross-referenced Drug Master File;
·
Conduct an additional nonclinical study in a large animal (such as a pig) to assess the safety, activity, and distribution of the product candidate for pancreatic cancer; and
·
Revise the Investigators Brochure to include any additional preclinical studies conducted in response to the clinical hold and remove any statements not supported by the data the Company generated.
The FDA also requested that the Company address
the following issues as an amendment to the Company’s IND:
·
Provide a Certificate of Analysis for pc3/2B1 plasmid that includes tests for assessing purity, safety, and potency;
·
Perform qualification studies for the drug substance filling step to ensure that the Company’s product candidate for pancreatic cancer remains sterile and stable during the filling process;
·
Submit an updated batch analysis for the Company’s product candidate for the specific lot that will be used for manufacturing all future product candidates;
·
Provide additional details for the methodology for the Resorufin (CYP2B1) potency and the PrestoBlue cell metabolic assays;
·
Provide a few examples of common microcatheters that fit the specifications in ‌the Company’s Angiography Procedure Manual;
·
Clarify the language in ‌our Pharmacy Manual regarding proper use of the syringe fill with the Company’s product candidate for pancreatic cancer; and
·
Provide a discussion with data for trial of the potential for cellular and humoral immune reactivity against the heterologous rat CYP2B1 protein and potential for induction of autoimmune-mediated toxicities in ‌our study population.
The Company assembled a scientific and regulatory
team of experts to address the FDA requests. That team has been working diligently to complete the items requested by the FDA. The Company
is in the latter stages of conducting the studies and providing the information requested by the FDA. The Company has completed the pilot
study of two pigs and is evaluating the preliminary data before commencing the larger study of 90 pigs.
11
Impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s Financial
Condition and Results of Operations
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared
an outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the world’s economies have experienced pronounced effects. Despite the multiple COVID-19
vaccines globally, there remains uncertainty around the extent and duration of disruption and any future related financial impact cannot
reasonably be estimated at this time. COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause significant, industry-wide delays in clinical trials.
Although the Company is not yet in a clinical trial, the Company has filed an IND with the FDA to commence a clinical trial in LAPC, and
this clinical trial may experience delays relating to COVID-19 once commenced, including but not limited to: (i) delays or difficulties
in enrolling patients in the Company’s clinical trial if the FDA allows the Company to go forward with the trial; (ii) delays or
difficulties in clinical site activation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site personnel;
(iii) delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct the clinical trial, including interruption in global
shipping that may affect the transport of the Company’s clinical trial product; (iv) changes in local regulations as part of a response
to COVID-19 which may require the Company to change the ways in which its clinical trial is to be conducted, which may result in unexpected
costs, or to discontinue the clinical trial altogether; (v) diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials,
including the diversion of hospitals serving as the Company’s clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of
the Company’s clinical trial; (vi) interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to
limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, or interruption of clinical trial
subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data; (vii) risk that participants
enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical
trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events; (viii) delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics
committees, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;
(ix) limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of the Company’s clinical trial because of
sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; (x) refusal of the FDA
to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; and (xi) interruption or delays to the Company’s clinical trial activities.
Many of these potential delays may be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 in foreign countries where the Company is conducting these
preclinical studies, including India, Europe, Singapore and Thailand.
Further, the various precautionary measures taken
by many governmental authorities around the world in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 has had and may continue to have an adverse
effect on the global markets and global economy, including on the availability and pricing of employees, resources, materials, manufacturing
and delivery efforts and other aspects of the global economy. COVID-19 could materially disrupt the Company’s business and operations,
hamper its ability to raise additional funds or sell securities, continue to slow down the overall economy, curtail consumer spending,
interrupt the Company’s supply chain, and make it hard to adequately staff the Company’s operations.
Nasdaq Listing
The Company’s common stock began trading
on Nasdaq on August 10, 2021, under the symbol “PMCB.” Prior to that, the Company’s common stock was quoted on the OTCQB
Market under the symbol “PMCB.”
Reverse Stock Split
Effective July 12, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate
of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State that authorized a
1:1500
reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The reverse
stock split resulted in reducing the authorized number of shares of the Company’s common stock from 50 billion to 33,333,334 with
a par value of $0.0001 per share. Any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the next whole share.
All warrant, option, share and per share information in this Quarterly Report gives retroactive effect to such 1:1500 reverse stock split.

NOTE 2 –
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company operates independently and through four wholly owned
subsidiaries: (i) Bio Blue Bird; (ii) PharmaCyte Biotech Europe Limited; (iii) PharmaCyte Biotech Australia Pty. Ltd.; and (iv) Viridis
Biotech, Inc. and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission. Upon consolidation, intercompany
balances and transactions are eliminated. The Company’s
14.3 % investment in SG Austria is presented on the cost method of accounting.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
Statements
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). U.S. GAAP requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of the Company’s Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions,
which could have a material effect on the reported amounts of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
The severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of COVID-19, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult
to predict. Therefore, the Company’s accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 and may change
materially in future periods.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks
and short-term liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less.
Intangible Assets
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
standard on goodwill and other intangible assets prescribes a two-step process for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangibles, which is performed annually, as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred. The first step tests for impairment,
while the second step, if necessary, measures the impairment. The Company has elected to perform its annual analysis at the end of its
reporting year.
The Company’s intangible assets are licensing
agreements related to the Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology for $ 1,549,427
and diabetes license for $ 2,000,000
for an aggregate
total of $ 3,549,427 .
These intangible assets have an indefinite life;
therefore, they are not amortizable.
The Company concluded that there was
no
impairment
of the carrying value of the intangible assets for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If the estimated
future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from the use of an asset are less than carrying value, a write-down would
be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. No impairment was identified or recorded during the nine months ended
January 31, 2023, and 2022.
13
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
For certain of the Company’s non-derivative
financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term
maturities of these instruments.
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held
by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy
for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported
in the consolidated balance sheets for current liabilities qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair
values because of the short period between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market
rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
·
Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
·
Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, which are observable either directly or indirectly; and
·
Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
Income Taxes
Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability
method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards,
and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
A valuation allowance is provided for deferred income tax assets when,
in management’s judgment, based upon currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of such deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on an
on-going evaluation of current information including, among other things, historical operating results, estimates of future earnings in
different taxing jurisdictions and the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences. The Company believes the determination
to record a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred income tax asset is a significant accounting estimate because it is based on, among
other things, an estimate of future taxable income in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, which is susceptible to change and may
or may not occur, and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material. In determining when to release the valuation
allowance established against the Company’s net deferred income tax assets, the Company considers all available evidence, both positive
and negative. Consistent with the Company’s policy, and because of the Company’s history of operating losses, the Company
does not currently recognize the benefit of all its deferred tax assets, including tax loss carry forwards, which may be used to offset
future taxable income. The Company continually assesses its ability to generate sufficient taxable income during future periods in which
deferred tax assets may be realized. When the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will recover its deferred tax assets,
the Company will reverse the valuation allowance as an income tax benefit in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
The U.S. GAAP method of accounting for uncertain
tax positions utilizes a two-step approach to evaluate tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires evaluation of the tax position to
determine if based solely on technical merits it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Step two, measurement, is addressed
only if a position is more likely than not to be sustained. In step two, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit,
determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities.
If a position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition in step one, no benefit is recorded until the first subsequent
period in which the more likely than not standard is met, the issue is resolved with the taxing authorities or the statute of limitations
expires. Positions previously recognized are derecognized when the Company subsequently determines the position no longer is more likely
than not to be sustained. Evaluation of tax positions, their technical merits and measurements using cumulative probability are highly
subjective management estimates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus
Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act to provide certain relief as a result of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak.
The Company maintains a full valuation allowance on its U.S. net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax asset remeasurement (tax expense) was
offset by a net decrease in valuation allowance, which resulted in no impact on the Company's income tax expense. Therefore, the Company
does not expect the provisions in the CARES Act will impact the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
On March 11, 2021, Congress enacted the American
Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The Company does not expect the provisions of this Act will impact the Company’s Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Research and Development
Research and development (“R&D”)
expenses consist of costs incurred for direct and overhead-related research expenses and are expensed as incurred. Costs to acquire technologies,
including licenses, which are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred.
Technology developed for use in the Company’s product candidates is expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been
established.
R&D costs for the three months ended January
31, 2023, and 2022 were $ 45,393
and $ 158,039 , respectively, and for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, were $ 382,662
and
$ 436,872 , respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation
expense for only those awards ultimately expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. The
Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. This model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating
the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time
of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The assumptions used in calculating
the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management's judgment. Thus, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the stock-based compensation
expense could be materially different in the future.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company has no significant off-balance-sheet
concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. The Company
maintains most of its cash balance at financial institutions located throughout the United States. Accounts at these institutions are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. Uninsured balances aggregated approximately $ 1,100,000
and $ 36,356,000
at January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Management believes it is not
exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company translates the financial statements
of its foreign subsidiaries from the local (functional) currencies to U.S. dollars in accordance with FASB ASC 830,
Foreign Currency
Matters . All assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, while revenue
and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Adjustments for foreign currency translation fluctuations
are excluded from net loss and are included in other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses on short-term intercompany foreign
currency transactions are recognized as incurred.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference
Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) and also
issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, “Topic 848”). Topic 848 is effective for all entities
as of March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2024, and provides optional guidance for contract modifications and certain hedging relationships
associated with the transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. The Company’s adoption of Topic 848 during
the period ended January 31, 2023, did not result in an impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
The Company maintains two equity incentive plans:
the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (“2022 Plan”) and the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (“2021 Plan” and, together with
the 2022 Plan, the “Plans”). The 2022 Plan serves as the successor to the 2021 Plan. The Plans provide for the issuance of
incentive stock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), stock grants and stock-based awards to
employees, directors, and consultants of the Company.
2022 Equity Incentive Plan
Effective December 28, 2022, the Company implemented
the 2022 Plan which was approved by the Company’s stockholders. The 2022 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the
Board (“Compensation Committee”) and has
2,750,000
shares available.
18
2021 Equity Incentive Plan
Effective June 30, 2021, the Company implemented
the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (“2021 Plan”) which was approved by the Company’s stockholders. The 2021 Equity Plan
is administered by the Compensation Committee and had
166,667
shares available.
Stock Options
As of January 31, 2023, the Company had
281,936
outstanding stock options to its directors and officers (collectively, “Employee Options”) and consultants (“Non-Employee
Options”).
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023,
and 2022, the Company granted
251,002
and
7,334
Employee Options, respectively.
The fair value of the Employee Options at the
date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, based on the following weighted average assumptions:
Assumptions for options
Nine Months Ended January 31,
2023
2022
Risk-free interest rate
3.30 %

Expected volatility
133 %
129 %
Expected lives (years)
3.5
2.7
Expected dividend yield
0.00 %
0.00 %
The Company’s computation of expected volatility
is based on the historical daily volatility of its publicly traded stock. For stock option grants issued during the nine months ended
January 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company used a calculated volatility for each grant. The Company lacks adequate information about the
exercise behavior now and has determined the expected term assumption under the simplified method provided for under ASC 718, which averages
the contractual term of the Company’s stock options of five years with the average vesting term of two and one-half years for an
average of three years. The dividend yield assumption of zero is based upon the fact the Company has never paid cash dividends and presently
has no intention of paying cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is equal to the U.S. Treasury rates in effect
at the time of the grant for instruments with a similar expected life.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023,
the Company granted
no
Non-Employee Options.

The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options
as of January 31, 2023, was $ 2,958 . This represents options with exercise prices less than the $2.89 per share closing price of the Company’s

Warrants
The warrants issued by the Company are equity
classified. The fair value of the warrants was recorded as additional paid-in-capital, and no further adjustments are made.
The Company concluded the following warrants met
the permanent equity criteria classification as they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately
exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued. The warrants are immediately exercisable and do not embody an
obligation for the Company to repurchase the shares. The warrants also permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares upon exercise
and do not provide any guarantee of value or return.
The Company elected to early adopt ASU No. 2020-06
Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company acquires assets still in development
and enters R&D arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon
the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required, contingent
upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development lifecycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the
product for marketing by a regulatory agency). If required by the license agreements, the Company may have to make royalty payments based
upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical products if regulatory approval for marketing is obtained.
Office Lease
On December 2, 2020, the Company entered into
a lease for its office space in Laguna Hills, California for a six-month term commencing on March 1, 2021, which expired on August 31,

Compensation Agreements
The Company entered into executive compensation
agreements with Kenneth L. Waggoner, Gerald W. Crabtree and Carlos A. Trujillo in March 2015, each of which was amended in December 2015
and March 2017. The Company’s compensation agreements with Mr. Waggoner and Mr. Trujillo were amended and restated effective January
1, 2022. The compensation agreements with Dr. Crabtree had a term of two years and the compensation agreements for Mr. Waggoner and Mr.
Trujillo had a term of three years, with automatic renewals unless the Company or the officer provides written notice of termination at
least ninety days prior to the end of the current term.
Effective October 6, 2022, Mr. Waggoner signed
the Separation, Consulting and Release Agreement (“Separation Agreement”), whereby he resigned from all positions with the
Company and its subsidiaries. The Separation Agreement contains a consulting services agreement covering a twelve-month period, whereby
Mr. Waggoner will serve as an independent contractor for the Company in exchange for a monthly consulting fee of approximately $36,000
for the duration of such period.
Effective October 11, 2022, Dr. Crabtree signed
a release agreement with the Company, whereby he resigned from all Company positions, including all positions with the Company’s
subsidiaries.
In May 2017, the Company amended the compensation
agreements with each of the then-current independent Board members, and the terms of such amended agreements continue in effect until
a member is no longer on the Board.
As of January 31, 2023, the Company had five directors.
Each director was entitled to receive $12,500 in cash for each calendar quarter of service on the Board.
On August 15, 2022, the Company and the Board:
(i) accepted the previously tendered irrevocable resignation of each of Dr. Matthias Löhr, Dr. Raymond C.F. Tong, Thomas Liquard,
Dr. Gerald W. Crabtree, and Carlos A. Trujillo, as members of the Board, and (ii) appointed Jonathan L. Schechter, Joshua N. Silverman,
Daniel Allen, Daniel S. Farb, and Jack E. Stover as independent members of the Board, effective immediately, each with a term expiring
at the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders or until such person’s earlier death, resignation, disqualification or
removal.
On November 1, 2022, Jack E. Stover notified the
Company of his decision to resign from the Board effective immediately. On November 14, 2022, in accordance with the recommendation of
the Company’s Nominating Committee, Robert Weinstein was appointed to serve as a director of the Board and the Chairperson of the
Audit Committee, with a term expiring at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders or until death, resignation, disqualification
or removal.
24
On November 14, 2022, the Board approved the employment
of Mr. Joshua Silverman as the Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim President and Interim Chairman of the Board on a month-to-month
basis. Upon Mr. Silverman accepting employment he was no longer an independent director.
On December 28, 2022, the Company held its annual
meeting of stockholders. The stockholders voted to elect the following directors to serve one-year terms expiring in 2023: Joshua N. Silverman,
Jonathan L. Schechter, Michael M. Abecassis, Robert Weinstein and Wayne R. Walker.
Service Agreements
The Company has entered into several service agreements
with independent and related parties pursuant to which services will be provided over a specified period-of-time related to the IND which
the FDA has placed on clinical hold. The services include regulatory affairs strategy, advice and follow up work on the IND and services
related to having the clinical hold lifted. The total cost is estimated to be approximately $214,000, of which the related party (SG Austria
and its subsidiaries) portion will be approximately $157,000. These amounts take into account some of the cost associated with the work
and preclinical studies required to lift the clinical hold.
NOTE 9 –
INCOME TAXES
At January 31, 2023, the Company had federal and
state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 55,936,000
and $ 52,187,000 , respectively, available to offset against future
taxable income; these operating loss carryforwards expire in 2021 through 2038. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 imposes an annual limitation
for the utilization of tax attributes if there is an “ownership change”. Based upon the equity activity during the nine months
ended January 31, 2023, the Company had an ownership change in August 2021. As a result of the change in-control that occurred in the
Company’s shareholder base in August 2021, approximately $ 37,083,000
and $ 40,838,000
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards,
respectively, became limited in their availability. The remaining net operating loss carryforwards are approximately $ 18,853,000
and $ 11,350,000
for federal and state purposes, respectively.
Current tax laws limit the amount of loss available
to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. Therefore, the amount available to offset future
taxable income may be limited. Based on the assessment of all available evidence including, but not limited to, the Company’s limited
operating history in its core business and lack of profitability, uncertainties of the commercial viability of its technology, the impact
of government regulations and healthcare reform initiatives and other risks normally associated with biotechnology companies, the Company
has concluded that is more likely than not that these operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. Accordingly, 100% of the deferred
tax valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets.
The Company’s policy is to recognize any
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of the nine months ended January
31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had accrued
no
interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022, for additional information regarding
income taxes.
NOTE 10 –
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by
dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares and potentially dilutive shares of common stock
outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would be outstanding if the potentially
dilutive securities had been issued. Potential shares of common stock outstanding principally include stock options and warrants. During
the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company incurred losses. Accordingly, the effect of any common stock equivalent
would be anti-dilutive during those periods and are not included in the calculation of diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding.

TREASURY STOCK
In May 2022, the Board authorized a share repurchase
program to acquire its outstanding common stock for up to $ 10
million . In January 2023, the Board authorized an additional share repurchase
program to acquire up to an additional $10 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (“the New Program”). In
conjunction with the share repurchase programs, the Company selected a broker to repurchase shares on behalf of the Company. The amount
of common stock repurchased on any given trading day is determined by a formula, which is based on the market price of the common stock
and average daily volumes. Shares repurchased are held in treasury for general corporate purposes. During the nine months ended January
31, 2023, the Company repurchased
3,393,060
shares at a total cost, including commissions, of $ 9,254,005 . These shares are treated as
Treasury Stock using the cost method. The
3,393,060
shares repurchased are included in Treasury Stock in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets. At January 31, 2023, including the New Program, $ 10,745,995
remains available to repurchase the Company’s common
stock pursuant to the share repurchase programs.

Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including
but not limited to this Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”)
contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are intended to
qualify for the “safe harbor” created by those sections. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in other documents
filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and our management and other representatives may
make forward-looking statements orally or in writing to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. These statements
relate to future events or to our future operating or financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances
or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements can generally be identified
by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and include, but are not limited to, statements using terminology
such as “can”, “may”, “could”, “should”, “assume”, “forecasts”,
“believe”, “designed to”, “will”, “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”,
“estimate”, “potential”, “position”, “predicts”, “strategy”, “guidance”,
“intend”, “seek”, “budget”, “project” or “continue”, or the negative thereof
or other comparable terminology regarding beliefs, plans, expectations or intentions regarding the future.   You should read statements
that contain these words carefully because they:
·
discuss our future expectations;
·
contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition; and
·
state other “forward-looking” information.
We believe it is important to communicate our
expectations. However, forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about
our business and our industry and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Accordingly, our actual results
and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a variety
of factors and risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in this Quarterly Report, those set forth from time to time in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Commission”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 and the following
factors and risks:
·
As a result of the clinical hold that has been placed on our IND by the FDA, it has taken and may continue to take considerable time and expense to respond to the FDA, and no assurance can be given that the FDA will remove the clinical hold in which case our business and prospects will likely suffer material adverse consequences;
·
We contract with Austrianova for the manufacture of our product candidates and for certain preclinical and clinical activities. Austrianova may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. The production of our product candidates relies in part on the proprietary know-how of Austrianova which is held by them as a trade secret and as to which we are not privy;
·
We rely on officers of Austrianova for the development of our product candidates. If they decide to terminate their relationship with us, we may not be successful in the development of our product candidates;
·
In the event Austrianova experiences financial difficulties, their ability to provide products or services to us may be delayed or curtailed and may affect the carrying value of our intellectual property and cost-based investment in Austrianova;
28
·
At this time, we are unaware of any available substitute manufacturer other than Austrianova;
·
We are seeking FDA approval to commence a clinical trial in the U.S. of our product candidate for LAPC based on clinical data that was obtained in trials conducted nearly 20 years ago outside the U.S., and it is possible that the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations or conducted nearly 20 years ago nor allow us to proceed with a Phase 2b as opposed to a Phase 1 or Phase 1/2 trial;
·
Results in previous clinical trials of our encapsulated live cell and ifosfamide combination for pancreatic cancer may not be replicated in future clinical trials which could result in development delays or a failure to obtain marketing approval;
·
Due to the significant resources required for the development of our programs, and depending on our ability to access capital, we must prioritize development of certain product candidates. We may expend our limited resources on programs that do not yield a successful product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success;
·
As the patents covering our Cell-in-a-Box technology have expired, our intellectual property, which is primarily trade secrets, and data and market exclusivity may not be sufficient to block others from commercializing identical or competing products; and
·
We have experienced significant management changes which could increase our control risks and have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business and our results of operations.
Any or all of our forward-looking statements may
turn out to be wrong. They may be affected by inaccurate assumptions that we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Among the factors
that could affect future results are:
·
our expectations of future revenues, expenditures, capital or other funding requirements;
·
the inherent uncertainties of product development based on our new and as yet not fully proven technologies;
·
the risks and uncertainties regarding the actual effect on humans of seemingly safe and efficacious formulations and treatments when tested clinically;
·
the inherent uncertainties associated with clinical trials of product candidates;
·
the inherent uncertainties associated with the process of obtaining regulatory clearance or approval to market product candidates;
·
the inherent uncertainties associated with commercialization of products that have received regulatory clearance or approval;
·
economic and industry conditions generally and in our specific markets; and
·
the volatility of, and decline in, our stock price.
29
All forward-looking statements and risk factors
included in this Quarterly Report are made as of the date hereof, in each case based on information available to us as of the date hereof,
and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statement or risk factor, unless we are required to do so by law. If we do
update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make updates with respect to other forward-looking
statements or that we will make any further updates to those forward-looking statements at any future time.
Forward-looking statements may include our plans
and objectives for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to our product candidates and our future economic performance,
projections, business strategy and timing and likelihood of success. Assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements included in
this Quarterly Report involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, future
business decisions, and the time and money required to successfully complete development and commercialization of our technologies, all
of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.
Any of the assumptions underlying the forward-looking
statements contained in this Quarterly Report could prove inaccurate and, therefore, we cannot assure you that any of the results or events
contemplated in any of such forward-looking statements will be realized. Based on the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking
statements, the inclusion of any such statement should not be regarded as a representation or as a guarantee by us that our objectives
or plans will be achieved, and we caution you against relying on any of the forward-looking statements contained herein.
Overview of Business
We are a biotechnology company focused on developing
cellular therapies for cancer, diabetes, and malignant ascites based upon a proprietary cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology
known as “Cell-in-a-Box ® .” The Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology is intended to be used as a platform
upon which therapies for several types of cancer, including LAPC, will be developed. The current generation of our product candidate is
referred to as “CypCaps™.”
On August 15, 2022, the Company entered into a
Cooperation Agreement (“Cooperation Agreement”) with Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. and its affiliates, pursuant to which the Company
elected a reconstituted Board. The Board has formed a Business Review Committee to evaluate, investigate and review the Company’s
business, affairs, strategy, management and operations and in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to the Company’s management
and Board with respect thereto. The Business Review Committee is also reviewing many of the risks relative to the Company’s business.
In addition, the Board is reviewing risks associated with the Company’s development programs and its relationship with SG Austria,
including that all licensed patents have expired, that know-how relating to the Company’s Cell-in-a-Box® technology solely resides
with SG Austria, and that the incentives of SG Austria and its management may not be currently aligned with those of the Company. The
Board has curtailed spending on the Company’s programs, including pre-clinical and clinical activities, until the review by the
Business Review Committee and the Board is complete and the Board has determined the actions and plans to be implemented. The Business
Review Committee’s recommendations will include potentially seeking a new framework for the Company’s relationship with SG
Austria and its subsidiaries. In the event that the Company is unsuccessful in seeking an acceptable new framework, the Company will reevaluate
whether it should continue those programs which are dependent on SG Austria, including its development programs for LAPC, diabetes and
malignant ascites. The issues involving SG Austria have delayed the Company’s timeline for addressing the FDA clinical hold for
its planned clinical trial in LAPC and could result in other delays or termination of the development activities. In addition, the curtailment
of spending on the Company’s programs pending the review by the Business Review Committee and the Board may cause additional delays.
The Cell-in-a-Box ®
encapsulation
technology potentially enables genetically engineered live human cells to be used as a means to produce various biologically active molecules.
The technology is intended to result in the formation of pinhead-sized cellulose-based porous capsules in which genetically modified live
human cells can be encapsulated and maintained. In a laboratory setting, this proprietary live cell encapsulation technology has been
shown to create a micro-environment in which encapsulated cells survive and flourish. They are protected from environmental challenges,
such as the sheer forces associated with bioreactors and passage through catheters and needles, which we believe enables greater cell
growth and production of the active molecules. The capsules are largely composed of cellulose (cotton) and are bioinert.
30
We have been developing therapies for pancreatic
and other solid cancerous tumors by using genetically engineered live human cells that we believe are capable of converting a cancer prodrug
into its cancer-killing form. We encapsulate those cells using the Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology and place those capsules in
the body as close as possible to the tumor. In this way, we believe that when a cancer prodrug is administered to a patient with a particular
type of cancer that may be affected by the prodrug, the killing of the patient’s cancerous tumor may be optimized.
We have also been developing a way to delay the
production and accumulation of malignant ascites that results from many types of abdominal cancerous tumors. Our potential therapy for
malignant ascites involves using the same encapsulated cells we employ for pancreatic cancer but placing the encapsulated cells in the
peritoneal cavity of a patient and administering ifosfamide intravenously.
We have also been developing a potential therapy
for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. Our product candidate for the treatment of diabetes consists of encapsulated
genetically modified insulin-producing cells. The encapsulation will be done using the Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology. Implanting
these encapsulated cells in the body is designed to have them function as a bio-artificial pancreas for purposes of insulin production.
In addition to the two cancer programs discussed
above, we have been working on ways to exploit the benefits of the Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology to develop therapies for cancer
that involve prodrugs based upon certain constituents of the
Cannabis
plant. However, until the FDA allows us to commence our clinical
trial in LAPC and we are able to validate our Cell-in-a-Box ®
encapsulation technology in a clinical trial, we are not spending
any further resources developing our Cannabis Program.
Finally, the Company has been developing a potential
therapy for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. The Company’s product candidate for the treatment of diabetes
consists of encapsulated genetically modified insulin-producing cells. The encapsulation will be done using the Cell-in-a-Box ®
technology. Implanting these encapsulated cells in the body is designed to have them function as a bio-artificial pancreas for purposes
of insulin production.
Until the Business Review Committee completes
its evaluation of the Company’s programs and the Company enters into a new framework for its relationship with SG Austria, spending
on the Company’s development programs has been curtailed.
Investigational New Drug Application and Clinical
Hold
On September 1, 2020, we submitted an IND to the
FDA for a planned clinical trial in LAPC. On October 1, 2020, we received notice from the FDA that it had placed our IND on clinical hold.
On October 30, 2020, the FDA sent us a letter setting forth the reasons for the clinical hold and providing specific guidance on what
we must do to have the clinical hold lifted.
In order to address the clinical hold, the FDA
has requested that we:
·
Provide additional sequencing data and genetic stability studies;
·
Conduct a stability study on our final formulated product candidate as well as the cells from our Master Cell Bank (“MCB”);
·
Evaluate the compatibility of the delivery devices (the prefilled syringe and the microcatheter used to implant the CypCaps ™ ) with our product candidate for pancreatic cancer;
·
Provide additional detailed description of the manufacturing process of our product candidate for pancreatic cancer;
·
Provide additional product release specifications for our encapsulated cells;
31
·
Demonstrate comparability between the 1 st
and 2 nd
generation of our product candidate for pancreatic cancer and ensure adequate and consistent product performance and safety between the two generations;
·
Conduct a biocompatibility assessment using the capsules material;
·
Address specified insufficiencies in the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls information in the cross-referenced Drug Master File;
·
Conduct an additional nonclinical study in a large animal (such as a pig) to assess the safety, activity, and distribution of the product candidate for pancreatic cancer; and
·
Revise the Investigators Brochure to include any additional preclinical studies conducted in response to the clinical hold and remove any statements not supported by the data we generated.
The FDA also requested that we address the following
issues as an amendment to our IND:
·
Provide a Certificate of Analysis for pc3/2B1 plasmid that includes tests for assessing purity, safety, and potency;
·
Perform qualification studies for the drug substance filling step to ensure that the product candidate for pancreatic cancer remains sterile and stable during the filling process;
·
Submit an updated batch analysis for the product candidate for the specific lot that will be used for manufacturing all future product candidates;
·
Provide additional details for the methodology for the Resorufin (CYP2B1) potency and the PrestoBlue cell metabolic assays;
·
Provide a few examples of common microcatheters that fit the specifications in our Angiography Procedure Manual;
·
Clarify the language in our Pharmacy Manual regarding proper use of the syringe fill with the product candidate for pancreatic cancer; and
·
Provide a discussion with data for trial of the potential for cellular and humoral immune reactivity against the heterologous rat CYP2B1 protein and potential for induction of autoimmune-mediated toxicities in our study population.
We assembled a scientific and regulatory team
of experts to address the FDA requests. That team has been working diligently to complete the items requested by the FDA. We are in the
latter stages of conducting the studies and providing the information requested by the FDA. We have completed the pilot study of two pigs
and are evaluating the preliminary data before it commences the larger study of 90 pigs.
32
The following provides a detailed summary of our
activities to have the clinical hold lifted:
·
Additional Regulatory Expertise Added to IND Team . In addition to ‌our existing team of regulatory experts, we retained Biologics Consulting to perform a regulatory “Gap Analysis” and to assist us with our resubmission of the IND. Biologics Consulting is a full-service regulatory and product development consulting firm for biologics, pharmaceuticals and medical devices and has personnel with extensive FDA experience.
·
Stability Studies on Our Clinical Trial Product Candidate for Pancreatic Cancer . We have successfully completed the required product stability studies. The timepoints were 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of our product candidate for pancreatic cancer being stored frozen at -80C. These studies included container closure integrity testing for certain timepoints.
·
Additional Studies Requested by the FDA . We have successfully completed various additional studies requested by the FDA, including a stability study on the cells from our MCB used to make our CypCaps™. We are already at the 36-month stability timepoint for the cells from our MCB. We are also collating existing information on the reproducibility and quality of the filling of the MCB cells into vials ready for CypCaps™ manufacturing.
·
Determination of the Exact Sequence of the Cytochrome P450 2B1 Gene . We have completed the determination of the exact sequence of the cytochrome P450 2B1 gene inserted at the site previously identified on chromosome 9 using state-of-the-art nanopore sequencing. This is a cutting edge, unique and scalable technology that permits real-time analysis of long DNA fragments. The result of this analysis of the sequence data confirmed that the genes are intact.
·
Confirmation of the Exact Sequence of the Cytochrome P450 2B1 Gene Insert . An additional, more detailed analysis of the integration site of the cytochrome P450 2B1 gene from the augmented HEK293 cell clone that is used in our CypCaps™ was found to be intact. In this new study, we were able to confirm the previously determined structure of the integrated transgene sequence using more data points. These studies also set the stage for a next step analysis to determine the genetic stability of the cytochrome P450 2B1 gene at the DNA level after multiple rounds of cell growth. This new study has been completed in which our original Research Cell Bank (“RCB”) cells were compared with cells from the MCB. The analysis confirmed that the cytochrome P450 2B1 and the surrounding sequence has remained stable with no changes detected at the DNA level.
·
Biocompatibility Studies . We have been
involved with 10 biocompatibility studies requested by the FDA, eight of which have been completed successfully. The remaining studies
are underway or about to start. The Acute Systemic Toxicity Study of Empty Cellulose Sulphate Capsules in Mice is underway. The Skin Sensitization
Study of Empty Cellulose Sulphate Capsules in Guinea Pigs is about to start. These last two studies ‌should be completed well before
the pig study (see below) is completed.
To enable the biocompatibility studies to be performed,
we had Austrianova Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“Austrianova”) manufacture an additional 400 syringes of empty capsules.
·
Systemic Toxicity Testing . We evaluated the potential toxicity of the capsule component of our product candidate for pancreatic cancer‌ and determined there is no evidence of toxicity in any of the parameters examined. The study also confirmed previous data that shows our capsule material is bioinert.
·
Micro-Compression and Swelling Testing . This testing is underway. We are developing and optimizing two reproducible methods for testing and confirming the physical stability and integrity of our CypCaps™ under extreme pressure. These studies required the acquisition of new equipment by Austrianova as well as validation and integration into Austrianova’s Quality Control laboratory.
33
·
Break Force and Glide Testing . We are in the process of developing a protocol to measure whether the syringe, attached to the catheter when used to expel the capsules, will still have a break and glide force that is within the specifications we have established. We are setting the specifications based on the syringe/plunger manufacturer’s measured break and glide forces, or alternatively, accepted ranges for glide forces routinely used in the clinic.
·
Capsules Compatibility with the Syringe and Other Components of the Microcatheter Delivery System . We are in the process of showing that CypCaps™ are not in any way adversely affected by the catheters used by interventional radiologists to deliver them into a patient. Compatibility data is being generated to demonstrate that the quality of the CypCaps™ is maintained after passage through the planned microcatheter systems.
·
CypCaps Capsules and Cell Viability after Exposure to Contrast Medium . We have commenced testing to show that exposure of CypCaps™ to the contrast medium interventional radiologists ‌used to implant the CypCaps™ in a patient has no adverse effect on CypCaps™. Contrast medium is used to visualize the blood vessels during implantation.
·
Master Drug File Information . Austrianova is providing additional detailed confidential information on the manufacturing process, including information on the improvements and advancements made to our product candidate for pancreatic cancer since the last clinical trials were conducted with respect to reproducibility and safety. However, Austrianova has not changed the overall physical characteristics of CypCaps™ between the 1 st
and 2 nd
generations.
·
Additional Documentation Requested by the FDA .
We are in the process of updating our IND submission documentation, including our discussion on immunological aspects of our treatment
for LAPC.
·
Pig Study . We have commenced a study in pigs to address biocompatibility and long-term implantation and dispersion of CypCaps™. The study has two phases: (i) a pilot study with 2 pigs; and (ii) a 90-pig study. The first phase has been completed and we are evaluating preliminary data. We believe this study should complement the positive data already available from the previous human clinical trials showing the safety of CypCaps™ implantation in human patients. The second phase of the pig study may be delayed as a result of supply chain problems, production delays at Austrianova, and to the Company’s curtailment of spending pending review of the Company’s programs by the Business Review Committee and the reconstituted Board (See “Business Review Committee”), including seeking a new framework for its relationship with SG Austria and its subsidiaries.
Reverse Stock Split
Effective July 12, 2021, we filed a Certificate
of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State that authorized a 1:1500 reverse stock split of our common stock. The reverse stock split
resulted in reducing the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 50 billion to 33,333,334 with a par value of $0.0001 per
share. Any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the next whole share. All warrants, option, share
and per share information in this Quarterly Report gives retroactive effect to such 1:1500 reverse stock split.
34
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Financial Condition
and Results of Operations
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared
an outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the world’s economies have experienced pronounced effects. Despite the multiple COVID-19
vaccines globally, there remains uncertainty around the extent and duration of disruption and any future related financial impact cannot
reasonably be estimated at this time. COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause significant, industry-wide delays in clinical trials.
Although the Company is not yet in a clinical trial, the Company has filed an IND with the FDA to commence a clinical trial in LAPC, and
this clinical trial may experience delays relating to COVID-19 once commenced, including but not limited to: (i) delays or difficulties
in enrolling patients in the Company’s clinical trial if the FDA allows the Company to go forward with the trial; (ii) delays or
difficulties in clinical site activation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site personnel;
(iii) delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct the clinical trial, including interruption in global
shipping that may affect the transport of the Company’s clinical trial product; (iv) changes in local regulations as part of a response
to COVID-19 which may require the Company to change the ways in which its clinical trial is to be conducted, which may result in unexpected
costs, or to discontinue the clinical trial altogether; (v) diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials,
including the diversion of hospitals serving as the Company’s clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of
the Company’s clinical trial; (vi) interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to
limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, or interruption of clinical trial
subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data; (vii) risk that participants
enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical
trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events; (viii) delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics
committees, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;
(ix) limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of the Company’s clinical trial because of
sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; (x) refusal of the FDA
to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; and (xi) interruption or delays to the Company’s clinical trial activities.
Many of these potential delays may be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 in foreign countries where the Company is conducting these
preclinical studies, including India, Europe, Singapore and Thailand.
Further, the various precautionary measures taken
by many governmental authorities around the world in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 has had and may continue to have an adverse
effect on the global markets and global economy, including on the availability and pricing of employees, resources, materials, manufacturing
and delivery efforts and other aspects of the global economy. COVID-19 could materially disrupt the Company’s business and operations,
hamper its ability to raise additional funds or sell securities, continue to slow down the overall economy, curtail consumer spending,
interrupt the Company’s supply chain, and make it hard to adequately staff the Company’s operations.
Performance Indicators
Non-financial performance indicators used by management
to manage and assess how the business is progressing will include, but are not limited to, the ability to: (i) acquire appropriate funding
for all aspects of our operations; (ii) acquire and complete necessary contracts; (iii) complete activities for producing genetically
modified human cells and having them encapsulated for our preclinical studies and the planned clinical trial in LAPC; (iv) have regulatory
work completed to enable studies and trials to be submitted to regulatory agencies; (v) complete all required tests and studies on the
cells and capsules we plan to use in our clinical trial in patients with LAPC; (vi) ensure completion of the production of encapsulated
cells according to cGMP regulations to use in our planned clinical trial; (vii) complete all of the tasked the FDA requires of us in order
to have the clinical hold lifted; and (viii) obtain approval from the FDA to lift the clinical hold on our IND so that we may commence
our clinical trial in LAPC.
There are numerous items required to be completed
successfully to ensure our final product candidate is ready for use in our planned clinical trial in LAPC. The effects of material transactions
with related parties, and certain other parties to the extent necessary for such an undertaking, may have substantial effects on both
the timeliness and success of our current and prospective financial position and operating results. In addition, the review of our programs
by our Business Review Committee and reconstituted Board and the curtailment of spending until their review is complete and recommendations
are made may have an adverse effect on the timeliness and success of our programs. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in seeking a new
framework for the Company’s relationship with SG Austria and its subsidiaries, the Company will reevaluate whether it should continue
those programs which are dependent on SG Austria, including its programs for LAPC, diabetes and malignant ascites. See “Overview
of Business.” We will assess these factors on a regular basis to provide accurate information to our shareholders.

Operating Activities:
The cash and cash equivalents used in operating
activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, is a result of our net losses offset by securities issued for services
and compensation of approximately $648,000 and $104,000, respectively, other income of approximately $166,000 and $0, respectively, and
changes to prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling approximately $129,000 and $213,000, respectively.
Investing Activities : We had no investing
activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022.
Financing Activities:
The cash and cash equivalents used in financing
activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, is mainly attributable to the repurchase of common stock net of the proceeds from
the sale of our common stock in the amount of approximately $9.3 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents
totaled approximately $73 million, compared to approximately $87 million as of January 31, 2022. Working capital was approximately $72
million as of January 31, 2023, compared to approximately $87 million as of January 31, 2022. The decrease in cash is attributable to
an increase in our operating expenses of approximately $3.5 million and the repurchase of our common stock of approximately $9.3 million.
On August 9, 2021, the Company entered into an
underwriting agreement to offer and sell shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase
common stock in a public offering (“First Offering”). The gross proceeds of the First Offering were $15 million, before deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.
In August 2021, the Company received 27 cash exercise
notices relating to the common warrants with respect to the First Offering totaling 2,522,387 warrant shares (“Warrant Exercises”).
The Company received approximately $10,720,000 and issued 2,522,387 shares of common stock as a result of the exercise notices.
On August 19, 2021, the Company entered into a
securities purchase agreement (“Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional investors (“Purchasers”)
pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell in a registered direct offering (“Registered Direct Offering”) shares of the
Company’s common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock. Further, pursuant to the Securities Purchase
Agreement, in a concurrent private placement (together with the Registered Direct Offering, “Second Offering”), the Company
also agreed to issue to the Purchasers unregistered warrants (“Series A Warrants”) to purchase shares of common stock. The
Company received gross proceeds from the Second Offering, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by
the Company, of approximately $70 million. On November 17, 2021, the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 registering the
resale of the common stock underlying the Series A Warrants was declared effective by the Commission.
In total, in August 2021, we received funding
in the amount of approximately $87.4 million through the First Offering and the Second Offering and the Warrant Exercises. Sales of our
common stock, pre-funded warrants and exercise of Common Warrants occurred in the First Offering, Second Offering, and the Warrant Exercises.
38
On May 14, 2018, we entered into amendments to
all of the material agreements with SG Austria and Austrianova (see Section entitled, History of the Business” in Item 1. Business
in our Form 10-K for the period ended April 30, 2022, for a description of these amendments). These arrangements are under review by our
Business Review Committee and reconstituted Board which has curtailed spending on our programs until their review is complete and recommendations
are made. This includes seeking a new framework for the Company’s relationship with SG Austria and Austrianova. In the event the
Company is unsuccessful in such efforts, the Company will reevaluate whether it should continue those programs which are dependent on
SG Austria, including its programs for LAPC, diabetes and malignant ascites. We have no other off-balance sheet arrangements that could
have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
To meet our short and long-term liquidity needs,
we expect to use existing cash balances and a variety of other means. Other sources of liquidity could include additional potential issuances
of debt or equity securities in public or private financings, partnerships, collaborations and sale of assets. Our history of operating
losses and liquidity challenges may make it difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. The demand for the equity
and debt of pharmaceutical companies like ours is dependent upon many factors, including the general state of the financial markets. During
times of extreme market volatility, capital may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain such additional
capital could materially and adversely affect our business operations. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will
depend on many factors, but we believe that our cash on hand will enable us to fund operating expenses for at least the next 12 months
following the issuance of our financial statements.
Service Agreements
We entered into several service agreements, with
both independent and related parties, pursuant to which services will be provided over the next twelve months related to the clinical
hold on our IND submission involving LAPC. The services include developing studies and strategies relating to clearing the clinical hold.
The total cost is estimated to be approximately $214,000, of which the related party portion will be approximately $157,000. These agreements
are under review by our Business Review Committee and reconstituted Board which has curtailed spending on this program until their review
is complete and recommendations are made.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. We are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical
experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our financial statements are prepared.
On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements
are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty,
actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed
in Note 2 of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report. Management believes that
the accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and require
management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters
that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our Board.
39
Research and Development Expenses
R&D expenses consist of costs incurred for
direct and overhead-related research expenses and are expensed as incurred. Costs to acquire technologies, including licenses, which are
utilized in R&D and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Technology developed for use in our product candidates
is expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our stock-based compensation plans are described
in Notes 2 and 5 of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report. We follow the provisions
of ASC 718,
Compensation - Stock Compensation
(“ASC 718”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all stock-based awards made to employees.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock
is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock
is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and shares of common stock equivalents outstanding. Potentially
dilutive stock options and warrants to purchase 10,172,783 and 10,821,982 post reverse stock split shares of common stock at January 31,
2023, and 2022, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
New Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of all recently adopted and recently
issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes
to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.
The information called for by Item 3 is not required
for a smaller reporting company.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Interim Chairman, Interim Chief Executive
Officer, and Interim President, as our principal executive officer (“Chief Executive Officer”), and our Chief Financial Officer,
as our principal financial officer (“Chief Financial Officer”), evaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls
and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit to the Commission pursuant
to the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the period specified by the Commission’s rules and forms
and are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that, as of December 12, 2022, certain of our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in
internal control over financial reporting.
Reference should be made to our Form 10-K filed
with the Commission on July 28, 2022, for additional information regarding discussion of the effectiveness of the Company’s control
and procedures.
A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Also, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The
design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting
Effective October 6, 2022, the Chairman of the
Board, Chief Executive Officer, President and General Counsel, Mr. Kenneth L. Waggoner, resigned from all positions with the Company and
its subsidiaries. Mr. Waggoner will serve as an independent contractor for a period of twelve months to be available to assist with the
transition of management. On November 14, 2022, the Board approved the employment of Mr. Joshua N. Silverman as the Interim Chairman of
the Board, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim President.
Other than the foregoing, there were no changes
to our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
The Certifications of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer required in accordance with Rule 13a-14(a) under the Exchange Act and Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 (“Certifications”) are attached to this Quarterly Report. The disclosures set forth in this Item 4 contain information
concerning: (i) the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, and changes in internal control over financial reporting, referred
to in paragraph 4 of the Certifications; and (ii) material weaknesses in the design or operation of our internal control over financial
reporting, referred to in paragraph 5 of the Certifications. The Certifications should be read in conjunction with this Item 4 for a more
complete understanding of the matters covered by the Certifications.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
There is no material litigation currently pending
against us or any of our subsidiaries or to which any of our or our subsidiaries’ property is subject. To our knowledge, there is
no material litigation against any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such, and no such litigation is contemplated by any
governmental authorities.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The information called for by Item 1A is not required
for a smaller reporting company. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider
the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company filed with the Commission
on July 28, 2022. These risk factors could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Additional factors
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition or future results.
Other than as set forth below, there have been
no material changes to the risk factors previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company filed with the Commission
on July 28, 2022.
We have experienced significant management
changes which could increase our control risks and have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business and our results of operations.
We have recently experienced a number of changes
in our management, including changes in our Chief Executive Officer and Board. The magnitude of these changes and the short time interval
in which they have occurred add to the risks of control failures, including a failure in the effective operation of our internal control
over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. Control failures could result in material adverse effects on our financial
condition and results of operations. It may take time for the new management team to become sufficiently familiar
with our business and each other to effectively develop and implement our business strategies. The turnover of key management positions
could further harm our financial performance and results of operations. Management attention may be diverted from regular business concerns
by reorganizations.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds.

Board had authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $10 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase
