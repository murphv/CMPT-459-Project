–
Credit Losses (Topic
326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
the objective of which is to provide financial statement users with more information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by an entity. Current GAAP requires an “incurred loss” methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable that a loss has been incurred. Because this methodology restricted the recognition of credit losses that are expected, but did
not
yet meet the “probable” threshold, ASU
No.
2016 - 13
was issued to require the consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information when determining estimates of credit losses. The ASU is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach, and the ASU could have been early-adopted in the fiscal year that began after
December 15, 2018.
When issued, ASU
No.
2016 - 13
was required to be adopted
no
later than the fiscal year beginning after

Accordingly, the Company intends to adopt ASU

2016 - 13
effective as of
April 3, 2023.
Because the Company assigns substantially all of its trade accounts receivable under factoring agreements with The CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. (“CIT”), a subsidiary of CIT Group Inc., the Company does
not
believe that the adoption of the ASU will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.
The Company has determined that all other ASUs issued which had become effective as of
January 1, 2023,
or which will become effective at some future date, are
not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes
The Company files income tax returns in the many jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S., several U.S. states and the People’s Republic of China. The statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction; tax years open to examination or other adjustment as of
January 1, 2023

March 28, 2021,
March 29, 2020,
March 31, 2019,
April 1, 2018
and
April 2, 2017.
In
August 2020,
the Company was notified by the Franchise Tax Board of the State of California of its intention to examine the Company’s California income tax returns for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2019,
April 1, 2018
and
April 2, 2017.
Further, in
February 2021,
the Company was notified by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of its intention to examine the Company’s amended federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended
April 2, 2017.
The ultimate resolution of these examinations could include administrative or legal proceedings. Although management believes that the calculations and positions taken on these income tax returns and all other filed income tax returns are reasonable and justifiable, the outcome of these or any other examination could result in an adjustment to the position that the Company took on such income tax returns.
The Company recorded discrete income tax charges of $ 6,000
during the
nine -month period ended
January 1, 2023,
and the Company recorded discrete income tax benefits of $ 11,000
and $ 83,000
during the
three - and
nine -month periods ended
December 26, 2021,
respectively, to reflect the net effects of the excess tax benefits and tax shortfalls arising from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of non-vested stock during the periods.

Carousel Designs
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for the
three - and
nine -month periods ended
December 26, 2021
include income, expenses and losses associated with the operating activities of Carousel Designs, LLC (“Carousel”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that manufactured and marketed infant and toddler bedding directly to consumers online from a facility in Douglasville, Georgia. On
May 5, 2021,
the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the closure of Carousel due to its high costs, declining sales and operating losses, as well as management’s determination that, due to post-COVID- 19
competitive pressures in the infant, toddler and juvenile products segment within the consumer products industry, such losses were likely to continue. Accordingly, the operations of Carousel ceased on
May 21, 2021.
During the
three - and
nine -month periods ended
December 26, 2021,
Carousel experienced a gross loss of $ 1,000
and $ 689,000 , respectively. The gross loss was the result of the sale of inventory below cost and, for the

Financing Arrangements
Factoring Agreements:  To reduce its exposure to credit losses, the Company assigns substantially all of its trade accounts receivable to CIT pursuant to factoring agreements, which have expiration dates that are coterminous with that of the financing agreement described below. Under the terms of the factoring agreements, CIT remits customer payments to the Company as such payments are received by CIT. As such, the Company does
not
take advances on the factoring agreements.
CIT bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved shipments, while the Company bears the responsibility for adjustments from customers related to returns, allowances, claims and discounts. CIT
may
at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer. If such a termination or limitation occurs, then the Company either assumes (and
may
seek to mitigate) the credit risk for shipments to the customer after the date of such termination or limitation or discontinues shipments to the customer. Factoring fees, which are included in marketing and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, amounted to $ 77,000
and $ 99,000
for the
three -month periods ended
January 1, 2023
and
December 26, 2021,
respectively, and amounted to $ 224,000
and $ 248,000
for the
nine -month periods ended
January 1, 2023
and
December 26, 2021,
respectively.
Credit Facility:   The Company’s credit facility as of
January 1, 2023
consisted of a revolving line of credit under a financing agreement with CIT of up to $ 26.0
million, which includes a $ 1.5
million sub-limit for letters of credit. The financing agreement matures on
July 11, 2025,
bears interest at prime minus
1.0 % or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus
1.6 %, and is secured by a
first
lien on all assets of the Company. At
January 1, 2023,
the Company had elected to pay interest on balances owed under the revolving line of credit, if any, under the SOFR option. The financing agreement also provides for the payment by CIT to the Company of interest at prime as of the beginning of the calendar month minus
2.0 %, which was
5.5 % as of
January 1, 2023,
on daily negative balances, if any, held at CIT.
As of
January 1, 2023
and
April 3, 2022,
there was
no
balance owed on the revolving line of credit, there was
no
letter of credit outstanding and $ 26.0
million was available under the revolving line of credit based on the Company’s eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. The financing agreement contains usual and customary covenants for agreements of that type, including limitations on other indebtedness, liens, transfers of assets, investments and acquisitions, merger or consolidation transactions, transactions with affiliates, and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company believes it was in compliance with these covenants as of
January 1, 2023.
Credit Concentration:
The Company’s accounts receivable as of
January 1, 2023
amounted to $ 18.9
million, net of allowances of $ 1.5
million. Of this amount, $ 17.2
million was due from CIT under the factoring agreements; an additional amount of $ 1.7
million was due from CIT as a negative balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit. The combined amount of $ 18.9
million represented the maximum loss that the Company could have incurred as of
January 1, 2023
if CIT had failed completely to perform its obligations under the factoring agreements and the revolving line of credit. The Company’s accounts receivable at
April 3, 2022
amounted to $ 23.2
million, net of allowances of $ 945,000 . Of this amount, $ 21.1
million was due from CIT under the factoring agreements; an additional amount of $ 1.5
million was due from CIT as a negative balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit. The combined amount of $ 22.6
million represented the maximum loss that the Company could have incurred as of
April 3, 2022
if CIT had failed completely to perform its obligations under the factoring agreements and the revolving line of credit.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan:
On
April 19, 2020,
the Company executed a Note (the “Note”) in connection with a loan made pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”), which is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of
2020.
The Note was entered into with CIT Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”) for the principal amount of $ 1,963,800
and accrued interest at
1.0%
per year.
As authorized by the provisions of the CARES Act, the Company applied to the Lender for forgiveness of all or a portion of the PPP Loan. The Note would have matured on
April 20, 2022,
but on
May 20, 2021,
the PPP Loan was forgiven in full and the SBA remitted to the Lender on that date the principal amount of the Note of $ 1,963,800
and interest of $ 21,000
that had accrued from the funding date of
April 20, 2020
through the forgiveness date of
May 20, 2021.
During the
three
months ended
June 27, 2021,
the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $ 1,985,000
associated with the forgiveness of the PPP Loan, which has been presented below income from operations in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in business combinations. For the purpose of presenting and measuring for the impairment of goodwill, the Company has
two
reporting units:
one
that produces and markets infant and toddler bedding, blankets and accessories and another that produces and markets infant and toddler bibs, toys and disposable products. The Company’s reporting units have recognized goodwill as of
January 1, 2023
and
April 3, 2022
of $ 30.0
million, which is reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated impairment charges of $ 22.9
million, for a net reported balance of $ 7.1
million.
The Company measures for impairment the goodwill within its reporting units annually as of the
first
day of the Company’s fiscal year. An additional interim measurement for impairment is performed during the year whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that suggests that the fair value of either of the reporting units of the Company has more likely than
not
(defined as having a likelihood of greater than
50% ) fallen below its carrying value. The annual or interim measurement for impairment is performed by
first
assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than
not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such qualitative factors so indicate, then the measurement for impairment is continued by calculating an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then an impairment charge is calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its estimated fair value,
not
to exceed the goodwill of the reporting unit.
On
April 4, 2022,
the Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than
not
that the fair values of the Company’s reporting units are less than their carrying values by evaluating relevant events and circumstances, including financial performance, market conditions and share price. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that the goodwill for each of the Company’s reporting units was
not
considered at risk of impairment.

Compensation
–
Stock Compensation , which requires stock-based compensation to be accounted for using a fair-value-based measurement. To determine the estimated fair value of stock options granted, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation formula, which is a closed-form model that uses an equation to estimate fair value. The following table sets forth the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the non-qualified stock options that were awarded to certain employees during the

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
Certain of the statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) within this Item 2. and elsewhere, including information incorporated herein by reference to other documents, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon management’s current expectations, projections, estimates and assumptions. Words such as “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “would” and variations of such words and similar expressions may identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause future results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks include, among others, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business operations, general economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, in the overall level of consumer spending and in the price of oil, cotton and other raw materials used in the Company’s products, changing competition, changes in the retail environment, the Company’s ability to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses, the level and pricing of future orders from the Company’s customers, the Company’s dependence upon third-party suppliers, including some located in foreign countries with unstable political situations, the Company’s ability to successfully implement new information technologies, customer acceptance of both new designs and newly-introduced product lines, actions of competitors that may impact the Company’s business, disruptions to transportation systems or shipping lanes used by the Company or its suppliers, and the Company’s dependence upon licenses from third parties. Reference is also made to the Company’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional factors that may impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements contained herein to conform to actual results or changes in the Company’s expectations, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Company was originally formed as a Georgia corporation in 1957 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2003. The Company operates indirectly through two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, NoJo Baby & Kids, Inc. and Sassy Baby, Inc., in the infant, toddler and juvenile products segment within the consumer products industry. The infant, toddler and juvenile products segment consists of infant and toddler bedding and blankets, bibs, disposables, toys and feeding products.
13
The Company’s products are marketed under Company-owned trademarks, under trademarks licensed from others and as private label goods. Sales of the Company’s products are made directly to retailers, such as mass merchants, large chain stores, juvenile specialty stores, value channel stores, grocery and drug stores, restaurants, wholesale clubs and internet-based retailers.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 26, 2021 include income, expenses and losses associated with the operating activities of Carousel, a wholly-owned subsidiary that manufactured and marketed infant and toddler bedding directly to consumers online from a facility in Douglasville, Georgia. On May 5, 2021, the Board approved the closure of Carousel due to a history of high costs, declining sales and operating and cash flow losses, as well as management’s determination that such losses were likely to continue. Accordingly, the operations of Carousel ceased at the close of business on May 21, 2021.
Foreign and domestic contract manufacturers produce most of the Company’s products, with the largest concentration being in China. The Company makes sourcing decisions based on quality, timeliness of delivery and price, including the impact of ocean freight and duties. Although the Company maintains relationships with a limited number of suppliers, the Company believes that its products may be readily manufactured by several alternative sources in quantities sufficient to meet the Company's requirements.
A summary of certain factors that management considers important in reviewing the Company’s results of operations, financial position, liquidity and capital resources is set forth below, which should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the preceding sections of this Quarterly Report.

Net Sales:
Sales decreased to $19.0 million for the three months ended January 1, 2023, compared with $22.7 million for the three months ended December 26, 2021, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 16.4%. Sales of bedding, blankets and accessories decreased by $2.8 million, and sales of bibs, toys and disposable products decreased by $963,000.
Sales declined in part due to sales to a struggling retail customer of the Company that were approximately $600,000 lower in the current-year quarter. Also, because the Company’s products can typically be purchased anytime during the mother’s pregnancy, sales declined during the current-year quarter as consumers, influenced by current macroeconomic conditions, and more so in the current quarter than in prior quarters, diverted their discretionary spending to holiday purchases.
Sales for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2023 decreased to $53.4 million, compared with $61.7 million for the nine-month period ended December 26, 2021, a decrease of $8.2 million, or 13.4%. Sales of bedding, blankets and accessories decreased by $6.8 million, and sales of bibs, toys and disposable products decreased by $1.4 million. The decreases in sales are primarily due to lower replenishment orders at retailers. Also, during the current-year period, the Company’s customers have been reducing their purchases as their inventories have increased, which the Company believes has resulted from customers’ excessive inventory purchases during the first quarter of calendar 2022 and consumers’ response to macroeconomic conditions.
14
Gross Profit:
Gross profit decreased by $1.7 million and decreased from 27.1% of net sales for the three-month period ended December 26, 2021 to 23.7% of net sales for the three-month period ended January 1, 2023. Gross profit decreased by $1.8 million but increased from 27.4% of net sales for the nine-month period ended December 26, 2021 to 28.3% of net sales for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2023. The decrease in the gross profit amount for the current-year periods is associated with the decline in sales during the periods and is net of the positive impact of the closure of Carousel, which in the prior-year nine-month period recognized a gross loss of $689,000, including losses from the sale of inventory below cost and the recognition of charges of $334,000 associated with the settlement with a supplier of a commitment to purchase fabric and $265,000 associated with the liquidation of Carousel’s remaining inventory upon the closure of the business. Although the gross profit in the prior-year nine-month period was impacted by increases in costs across the entire supply chain, the Company in the current year has realized some stabilization in its input costs. Finally, the Company has benefited from recent increases in the selling prices of its products.
Marketing and Administrative Expenses:
Marketing and administrative expenses decreased by $352,000, but increased from 13.6% of net sales for the three-month period ended December 26, 2021 to 14.4% of net sales for the three-month period ended January 1, 2023. Marketing and administrative expenses decreased by $733,000 but increased from 15.6% of net sales for the nine-month period ended December 26, 2021 to 16.6% of net sales for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2023. The prior-year period included $496,000 for charges incurred by Carousel.
Gain on extinguishment of debt:
On May 20, 2021, the PPP Loan was forgiven in full, which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $1,985,000 during the three months ended June 27, 2021 and the nine months ended December 26, 2021.
Income Tax Expense:
The Company’s provision for income taxes is based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate (“ETR”) from continuing operations of 23.3% for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2023, as compared with an estimated annual ETR from continuing operations of 20.0% for the nine-month period ended December 26, 2021. The gain on extinguishment of debt associated with the forgiveness of the PPP Loan was permitted to be excluded from taxable income, the effect of which lowered the ETR for the prior-year period by approximately four percentage points.
As a result of the consideration of the relevant information regarding the state portion of its income tax provision, the Company recorded discrete reserves for unrecognized tax liabilities of $12,000 and $22,000 during the three-month periods ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively, and $58,000 and $67,000 for the nine-month periods ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively, in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. The Company also recorded discrete income tax charges of $6,000 during the nine months ended January 1, 2023, and the Company recorded discrete income tax benefits of $11,000 and $83,000 during the three- and nine-months ended December 26, 2021, respectively, to reflect the net effects of the excess tax benefits and tax shortfalls arising from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of non-vested stock during the periods.
The ETR on continuing operations and the discrete income tax charges and benefits set forth above resulted in an overall provision for income taxes of 24.4% and 19.4% for the nine-month periods ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively.
Although the Company does not anticipate a material change to the ETR from continuing operations for the remainder of fiscal year 2023, several factors could impact the ETR, including variations from the Company’s estimates of the amount and source of its pre-tax income, and the actual ETR for the year could differ materially from the Company’s estimates.
FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $4.3 million for the nine-month period ended December 26, 2021 to $4.4 million for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2023. The increase in the current year was the result of a decrease in accounts receivable in the current year that was $6.0 million higher than the increase in the prior year and the gain on extinguishment of debt of $1,985,000 in the prior year that was associated with the forgiveness of the PPP Loan. These increases were offset by a $2.7 million decrease in net income from the prior year to the current year. There was also an increase in accounts payable in the prior year that was $2.3 million higher than the decrease in the current year. There was also a decrease in accrued liabilities in the current year that was $1.8 million higher than the increase in the prior year and an increase in inventory in the current year that was $997,000 higher than the increase in the prior year.
Net cash used in investing activities, which were primarily associated with capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, increased from $355,000 in the prior year to $363,000 in the current year.
15
Net cash used in financing activities, which were primarily associated with the payment of dividends, increased by $57,000 from the prior year to the current year.
As of January 1, 2023, there was no balance owed on the Company’s revolving line of credit with CIT, there was no letter of credit outstanding and $26.0 million was available under the revolving line of credit based on the Company’s eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances.
To reduce its exposure to credit losses and to enhance the predictability of its cash flow, the Company assigns substantially all of its trade accounts receivable to CIT under factoring agreements. Under the terms of the factoring agreements, CIT remits customer payments to the Company as such payments are received by CIT. As such, the Company does not take advances on the factoring agreements.
CIT bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved customers that are within approved credit limits, while the Company bears the responsibility for adjustments from customers related to returns, allowances, claims and discounts. CIT may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer. If such a termination or limitation were to occur, then the Company must choose to either assume the credit risk for shipments after the date of such termination or limitation or discontinue shipments to the customer. Factoring fees, which are included in marketing and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, amounted to $77,000 and $99,000 for the three-month periods ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively, and amounted to $224,000 and $248,000 for the nine-month periods ended January 1, 2023 and December 26, 2021, respectively.
The Company continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its supply chain, manufacturing and distribution operations, customers and employees, as well as the U.S. economy in general. However, due to the uncertainty as to the duration and widespread nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the success rates of vaccines for COVID-19 and the variants thereof, and the extent to which the vaccines are accepted and effectively administered, the Company cannot currently predict the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations and financial results.
The uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic include potential adverse effects on the overall economy, the Company’s supply chain, transportation services, employees and customers, consumer sentiment in general, and traffic within the retail stores that carry the Company’s products. The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company’s revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows and may require significant actions in response, including employee furloughs, closings of Company facilities, expense reductions or discounts of the pricing of the Company’s products, all in an effort to mitigate such effects.
Conditions surrounding COVID-19 change rapidly, and additional impacts of which the Company is not currently aware may arise. Based on past performance and current expectations, the Company believes that its anticipated cash flow from operations and the availability under its revolving line of credit are sufficient to fund the Company’s requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
The Company’s future performance is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. Based upon the current level of operations, the Company believes that its cash flow from operations and funds available under the revolving line of credit will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
For a discussion of market risks that could affect the Company, refer to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. of Part 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 3, 2022.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Although the Company could have an exposure to interest rate risk related to its floating rate debt, there was no balance outstanding on its floating rate debt as of January 1, 2023.
16
COMMODITY RATE RISK
The Company sources its products primarily from foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being in China. The Company’s exposure to commodity price risk primarily relates to changes in the prices in China of cotton, oil and labor, which are the principal inputs used in a substantial number of the Company’s products. In addition, although the Company pays its Chinese suppliers in U.S. dollars, a strengthening of the rate of the Chinese currency versus the U.S. dollar could result in an increase in the cost of the Company’s finished goods. There is no assurance that the Company could timely respond to such increases by proportionately increasing the prices at which its products are sold to the Company’s customers.
MARKET CONCENTRATION RISK
The Company’s financial results are closely tied to sales to its top two customers, which represented approximately 73% of the Company’s gross sales in fiscal year 2022. In addition, 40% of the Company’s gross sales in fiscal year 2022 consisted of licensed products, which included 33% of sales associated with the Company’s license agreements with affiliated companies of the Walt Disney Company. The Company’s results could be materially impacted by the loss of one or more of these licenses.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act.  Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
During the three-month period ended January 1, 2023, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR.
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is, from time to time, involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any such proceeding the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 3, 2022.
