NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) JANUARY 31, 2023   NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   This summary of significant accounting policies of Concrete Leveling Systems, Inc. (hereinafter the “Company”), is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.   Nature of Operations   The Company manufactures for sale specialized equipment for use in the concrete leveling industry. The Company’s product is sold primarily to end users.
On March 24, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Jericho Associates, Inc. (“Jericho”), a start-up company which plans to operate in the gaming, hospitality and entertainment industries. The Company issued Jericho 7,151,416 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to a performance requirement, which provides that by March 1, 2018, if the management of Jericho does not identify at least one entity or business opportunity for acquisition, in order to supplement the Company’s current business operations, the shares issued as part of the agreement shall be returned to the Company. In July 2017, an additional
481,000
shares were issued to shareholders of Jericho under the same contingencies as the original shares.   On February 25, 2018, Jericho identified the acquisition of 50% interests in two LLCs (the “LLCs”). The LLCs have a Term Sheet agreement to develop a casino and hotel resort, and provide certain gaming equipment on a shared profit basis (the “Project”). The Project is in the process of regulatory review, finalization of closing documents, and completion of financing. Notwithstanding the identification of the business opportunity, the shares issued to Jericho remain contingent upon the regulatory review, the finalization of closing documentation, and the completion of financing arrangements for the project. Also, upon the regulatory review, the finalization of closing documentation, and the completion of financing arrangements for the project, the Company’s President will cancel all shares of common stock held ( 879,167
shares as of January 31, 2023), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer will cancel all but
550,000
shares of common stock held ( 2,951,667
shares as of January 31, 2023), subject to an
18 -month non-dilution right in order to maintain an ownership percentage of
4.99 %, and the Company’s Secretary will cancel all but
45,000
shares of common stock held ( 185,000
shares as of January 31, 2023). Prior to the August 13, 2018 amendment to the agreement with Jericho, the Chief Executive Officer would cancel all but
523,000
shares of her common stock, subject to an
18 -month non-dilution right in order to maintain an ownership percentage of
4.99 %.
The amendment provided that the Chief Executive Officer would retain an additional 27,000 shares of common stock and the non-dilution right was eliminated.
9 Table of Contents   Principal Services
If the transaction with Jericho finalizes, the Company will operate two business divisions, which will be operated simultaneously and consist of the following:
The concrete leveling division of the business will fabricate and market a concrete leveling service unit utilized in the concrete leveling industry. This unit secures to the back of a truck and consists of a mixing device to mix lime with water and a pumping device capable of pumping the mixture under pressure into pre-drilled holes in order to raise the level of any flat concrete surface.
The gaming and hospitality division of the business will focus on casino gaming, hospitality, entertainment and leisure time industries, and will pursue opportunities in the tribal and commercial casino gaming industries, both in California and Nevada. The Company will also operate in the casino gaming technology industry, and is seeking opportunities to partner, joint venture, or acquire companies developing casino games that combine traditional casino games with the challenge of video games and the playability of social games, meaning games that pit the player’s skill against the skill of another player as opposed to the casino itself.
Basis of Presentation   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s year-end is July 31.   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, “ Revenue from contracts with customers ”. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the promised goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount; (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligation the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company’s performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.     10 Table of Contents   Accounts Receivable   The Company grants credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business. The Company provides for an allowance for uncollectable receivables based on prior experience. The allowance was $ 0
at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022.   Advertising and Marketing   Advertising and marketing costs are charged to operations when incurred. Advertising costs were $ 0
for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, which is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the statements of operations.   Inventory   Inventories, which consist of parts and work in progress, are recorded at the lower of first-in first-out cost or net realizable value (estimated selling price less costs of completion, disposal and transportation). When an impairment suggests that the carrying amounts of inventories might not be recoverable, the Company reviews such carrying amounts and estimates the net realizable value based on the most reliable evidence available at that time. An impairment loss is recorded if the net realizable value is less than the carrying value. Impairment indicators considered for these purposes are, among others, obsolescence, decrease in market prices, damage and a firm commitment to sell.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Property, Plant, and Equipment   Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided for by using the straight- line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.   Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major additions and betterments are capitalized. When items of property and equipment are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of net income.   Income taxes   Concrete Leveling Systems, Inc. recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting carrying amount of the Company’s assets and liabilities. The Company monitors its deferred tax assets and evaluates the need for a valuation allowance based on the estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that it believes does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. The Company also evaluates whether it has any uncertain tax positions and would record a reserve if management believes it is more-likely-than-not their position would not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. The Company’s assessment of tax positions as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, determined that there were no material uncertain tax positions.     11 Table of Contents   Going Concern   The Company has sustained substantial operating losses since its inception. In addition, the Company has used substantial amounts of working capital in its operations. Further, at January 31, 2023, current liabilities exceed current assets by $471,177, and total liabilities exceed total assets by $ 471,177 .
Success will be dependent upon management’s ability to obtain future financing and liquidity, and success of its future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
NOTE 2 - INCOME TAXES   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Additionally, the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carry forwards, is required to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.   In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset is required. A valuation allowance is provided for the portion of the deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies.   As of January 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $ 741,264
that may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income in
varying amounts through 2040 .   The Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities. Generally, the statute of limitations related to the Company’s federal and state income tax return is three years from the date of filing. The state impact of any federal changes of prior years remains subject to examination for a period of up to five years after formal notification to the states.   Management has evaluated tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740,
Income Taxes , and has not identified any significant tax positions, other than those disclosed.   Income taxes on continuing operations include the following:       January 31, 2023   January 31, 2022   Currently payable   $ - 0 -   $ - 0 -
Deferred     - 0 -     - 0 -   Total   $ - 0 -   $ - 0 -

15 Table of Contents   Overview   Concrete Leveling Services, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated on August 28, 2007 in the State of Nevada. The Company’s principal offices are located at 5046 East Boulevard Northwest, Canton, Ohio 44718. In Ohio, the Company does business under the trade name of CLS Fabricating, Inc. CLS has never declared bankruptcy, it has never been in receivership, and it has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings.
On March 24, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Jericho Associates, Inc. (“Jericho”), a start-up company which plans to operate in the gaming, hospitality and entertainment industries. The Company issued Jericho 7,151,416 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to a performance requirement, which provides that by March 1, 2018, if the management of Jericho does not identify at least one entity or business opportunity for acquisition, in order to supplement the Company’s current business operations, the shares issued as part of the agreement shall be returned to the Company. In July 2017, an additional 481,000 shares were issued to shareholders of Jericho under the same contingencies as the original shares.   On February 25, 2018, Jericho identified the acquisition of 50% interests in two LLCs (the “LLCs”). The LLCs have a Term Sheet agreement to develop a casino and hotel resort, and provide certain gaming equipment on a shared profit basis (the “Project”). The Project is in the process of regulatory review, finalization of closing documents, and completion of financing. Notwithstanding the identification of the business opportunity, the shares issued to Jericho remain contingent upon the regulatory review, the finalization of closing documentation, and the completion of financing arrangements for the project.
Also, upon the regulatory review, the finalization of closing documentation, and the completion of financing arrangements for the project, the Company’s President will cancel all shares of common stock held (879,167 shares as of January 31, 2023), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer will cancel all but 550,000 shares of common stock held (2,951,667 shares as of January 31, 2023), subject to an 18-month non-dilution right in order to maintain an ownership percentage of 4.99%, and the Company’s Secretary will cancel all but 45,000 shares of common stock held (185,000 shares as of January 31, 2023). Prior to the August 13, 2018 amendment to the agreement with Jericho, the Chief Executive Officer would cancel all but 523,000 shares of her common stock, subject to an 18-month non-dilution right in order to maintain an ownership percentage of 4.99%. The amendment provided that the Chief Executive Officer would retain an additional 27,000 shares of common stock and the non-dilution right was eliminated.
Principal Services
If a transaction with Jericho finalizes, the Company will operate two business divisions, which will be operated simultaneously and consist of the following:
The concrete leveling division of the business will fabricate and market a concrete leveling service unit utilized in the concrete leveling industry. This unit secures to the back of a truck and consists of a mixing device to mix lime with water and a pumping device capable of pumping the mixture under pressure into pre-drilled holes in order to raise the level of any flat concrete surface.
The gaming and hospitality division of the business will focus on casino gaming, hospitality, entertainment and leisure time industries, and will pursue opportunities in the tribal and commercial casino gaming industries, both in California and Nevada. The Company will also operate in the casino gaming technology industry, and is seeking opportunities to partner, joint venture, or acquire companies developing casino games that combine traditional casino games with the challenge of video games and the playability of social games, meaning games that pit the player’s skill against the skill of another player as opposed to the casino itself.
16 Table of Contents   For the Three and Six Months Ended
January 31, 2023
Compared to the Three and Six Months Ended
January 31, 2022   The Company generated $175 in revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2023, which compares to revenue of $160 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Our revenues increased during the three months ended January 31, 2023, due to higher parts sales.   The Company generated $375 in revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2023, which compares to revenue of $335 for the six months ended January 31, 2022. Our revenues increased during the six months ended January 31, 2023, due to higher parts sales.   Cost of sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $59, which compares to cost of sales of $59 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Our costs of sales were flat during the three months ended January 31, 2023.   Cost of sales for the six months ended January 31, 2023 was $141, which compares to cost of sales of $111 for the six months ended January 31, 2022. Our costs of sales increased during the six months ended January 31, 2023 due to higher parts sales.   Operating expenses, which consisted of selling, general, and administrative expenses, and legal and professional fees for the three months ended January 31, 2023, were $7,344. This compares with operating expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2022 of $5,944. Our operating expenses increased during the three months ended January 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in our professional fees resulting from higher accounting and auditing fees.
Operating expenses, which consisted of selling, general, and administrative expenses, and legal and professional fees for the six months ended January 31, 2023, were $25,765. This compares with operating expenses for the six months ended January 31, 2022 of $27,219. Our operating expenses increased during the six months ended January 31, 2023 primarily due to an overall increase in our professional fees resulting from higher accounting and auditing fees.   As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $9,796 for the three months ended January 31, 2023. This compares with a net loss of $8,316 for the three months ended January 31, 2022.
As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $30,633 for the six months ended January 31, 2023. This compares with a net loss of $31,933 for the six months ended January 31, 2022.
In its audited financial statements as of July 31, 2022, the Company was issued an opinion by its auditors that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the Company’s current financial position. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and market our products and our ability to generate revenues.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   As of January 31, 2023, we had cash of $550. As of July 31, 2022, we had cash of $747.   We believe that with our existing cash flows, we do not have sufficient cash to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. We believe that with the addition of our gaming and hospitality business, we will begin to generate increased revenue over the 2023 fiscal year. However, if our revenue is not sufficient to allow us to meet our cash requirements during the next twelve months, the Company may need to raise additional funds through the sale of debt or equity securities. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go out of business.     17 Table of Contents   Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended January 31, 2023 was $27,477. This compares to net cash used in operating activities of $28,448 for the six months ended January 31, 2022. We experienced a slightly higher operating loss during the six months ended January 31, 2022.   Cash flows provided by financing activities were $27,280 for the six months ended January 31, 2023 which compares to cash flows provided by financing activities of $28,275 for the six months ended January 31, 2022. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities is due to lower advances from stockholders during the six months ended January 31, 2023. We anticipate significant increases in cash flows provided by financing activities during the next 12 months, as we intend to raise capital through either debt or equity securities to fund our business.   As of January 31, 2023, our total assets were $27,290 and our total liabilities were $498,467. As of July 31, 2022, our total assets were $25,738 and our total liabilities were $466,282.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   We believe that the following critical policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements.   We disclose those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the first note to our financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results are likely to differ from these estimates, but management does not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations.   We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical because they have the greatest impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Going Concern   The Company was formed on August 28, 2007 and was in the development stage through July 31, 2009. The year ended July 31, 2010 was the first year during which it was considered an operating company. The Company has sustained substantial operating losses since its inception. In addition, the Company has used substantial amounts of working capital in its operations. Further, at January 31, 2023, our liabilities exceed our assets by $471,177.
Success will be dependent upon management’s ability to obtain future financing and liquidity, and success of its future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
18 Table of Contents   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.   Foreign Currency Transactions   None.   ITEM 3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK   As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.   ITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures”, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated our company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.   Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company’s financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) (2013). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. This assessment included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 31, 2023. The ineffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff:     (i) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;         (ii) lack of a code of ethics;         (iii) lack of a whistleblower policy;         (iv) lack of an independent board of directors or board committees related to financial reporting; and         (v) lack of multiple levels of supervision and review.     19 Table of Contents   We believe that the weaknesses identified above have not had any material effect on our financial results. While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is our management’s view that such a committee, including an independent financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial statements. Currently, the board of directors acts in the capacity of the audit committee. However, we are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the 2023 fiscal year, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.   Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.   Management’s Remediation Plan   The weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible.   However, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the current fiscal year as resources allow:     (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies;         (ii) adopt a written whistleblower policy and code of ethics; and         (iii) appoint an independent board of directors, including board committees related to financial controls and reporting.   The remediation efforts set out herein will be implemented in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.   Management believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our financial statements for the six month period ended January 31, 2023 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the six month period ended January 31, 2023.     20 Table of Contents   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   To the best of the Company’s knowledge and belief, no legal proceedings are currently pending or threatened.   ITEM 1A.
