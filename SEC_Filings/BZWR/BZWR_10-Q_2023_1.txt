Organization and Nature of Operations
Organization —Business Warrior Corporation (the Company” or “Business Warrior”) was originally incorporated under the name Kading Companies, S.A., under the International Business Companies Ordinance of the Territory of the British Virgin Islands on October 10, 1995. Kading Companies was traded on the Pink Sheets of the OTC Markets under the stock ticker KDNG. On January 27, 2020, Kading Companies was redomiciled in Wyoming. Bluume, LLC was founded in 2014 and was a sales and marketing organization that provided small businesses with basic advertising, merchant services, white label Point of Sale systems, and a white label business analytics software. On January 31, 2020, Bluume, LLC completed a triangular reverse merger with Kading Companies (formerly KDNG) and changed its name to Business Warrior. It is currently an active corporation in the state of Wyoming. The previous Bluume team took over all operations of the Company and formed a new business plan, which replaced all former plans of the previous management team at Kading Companies. In July 2020, the Company changed its stock ticker to BZWR.
On March 18, 2022, the Company acquired Helix House, LLC, a premium marketing agency that provides small business advertising services including digital marketing. Additionally, on June 18, 2022, the Company acquired FluidFi Inc., dba Alchemy Technology, a lending technology company that builds fully customized lending end-to-ending lending solutions.   Nature of Operations — Business Warrior has three divisions of the company: Helix House, LLC, Alchemy Technologies, and Business Warrior. Helix House is a premium marketing agency that provides small business advertising services including digital marketing (YouTube, Google, social media), traditional marketing (billboards, mailers, fliers, etc.), and social media content. Alchemy builds and manages lending software technology for enterprise businesses which are fully customized for each client. Through the combination of services from Helix House and Alchemy, Business Warrior offers a full service lending as a service solution known as PayPlan: a comprehensive lending software platform that includes marketing services to drive applicants for lenders and merchants.   2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation— The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated and wholly owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements reflect the elimination of all significant inter-company accounts and transactions.
Use of Estimates —The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual events and results could materially differ from those assumptions and estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk —Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash and accounts receivable arising from its normal business activities. The Company places its cash in what it believes to be credit-worthy financial institutions. The Company controls credit risk related to accounts receivable through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk, establishes an allowance, if required, for uncollectible accounts and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is limited.   Cash and Cash Equivalents —The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions, and at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits.     7 Table of Contents   Property and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets.
Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in earnings. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets —Potential impairments of long-lived assets are reviewed when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist. In accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 360-10, “Property, Plant and Equipment – Overall,” impairment is determined when estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the asset’s carrying value.   Goodwill —The Company’s goodwill balance of $ 2.3
million as of November 30, 2022 resulted from the acquisitions of Helix House, LLC and FluidFi, Inc. Helix House, LLC was acquired on March 17, 2022, and FluidFi, Inc. was acquired on June 8, 2022. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, which may result from the deterioration in the operating performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in the applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. Any resulting impairment charge would be recognized as an expense in the period in which impairment is identified. After performing a qualitative and quantitative analyses for the acquired companies, the Company recognized approximately $ 4.0
million in goodwill impairment during the year ended August 31, 2022.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts —
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the probability of future collection. The probability of future collection is based on specific considerations of historical loss patterns and an assessment of the continuation of such patterns based on past collection trends and known or anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The probability of future collection is also assessed by geography. To date, losses resulting from uncollected receivables have not exceeded management’s expectations. The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 459,117
and $ 0
as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively.   Income Taxes — Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.   The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of general and administrative expenses. Our federal tax return and any state tax returns are not currently under examination.   The Company has adopted ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Income Taxes , which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually from differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.     8 Table of Contents   Revenue Recognition —The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, “ Revenue from contracts with customers,”  (Topic 606). Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company’s main revenue stream is from sales of products. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company's performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery.   The Company has four main sources of revenue. Helix House is a premium marketing agency that charges monthly service fees and one-time project charges for providing small business advertising services including digital marketing (YouTube, Google, social media), traditional marketing (billboards, mailers, fliers, etc.), and social media content. FluidFi Inc, dba Alchemy builds fully customized lending end-to-end lending software solutions for banks, lenders, and financial technology firms. Alchemy charges monthly recurring fees for each client's software-as-a-service as well as contracted work for custom software development. Business Warrior collects revenue for building software lending solutions, and sales and marketing solutions associated with each lending client. Business Warrior Funding collects principal and interest payments for providing business loans to small businesses.   Identify the customer contract A customer contract is generally identified when the Company and a customer have executed an arrangement that calls for the Company to grant access to its online software products and provide professional services in exchange for consideration from the customer.   Identify performance obligations that are distinct A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and a company’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company has determined that subscriptions for its online software products are distinct because, once a customer has access to the online software product is fully functional and does not require any additional development, modification, or customization. Professional services sold are distinct because the customer benefits from the on-boarding and training to make better use of the online software products it purchased.   Determine the transaction price The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies. The Company estimates any variable consideration to which it will be entitled at contract inception, and reassesses at each reporting date, when determining the transaction price. The Company does not include variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will occur when any uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.   Allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. The Company determines the SSP of its goods and services based upon the average sales prices for each type of online software product and professional services sold. In instances where there are not sufficient data points, or the selling prices for a particular online software product or professional service are disparate, the Company estimates the SSP using other observable inputs, such as similar products or services.   Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied Revenues are recognized when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers. Revenue from online software products is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the Company’s online software products are made available to customers. Most subscription contracts are one year or less. The Company recognizes revenue from on-boarding, training, and consulting services as the services are provided. Cash payments received in advance of providing subscription or services are recorded to deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from the Company’s business lending solution is recognized as interest income and origination fees, based upon the loan that is issued to each customer.
Deferred Revenue The Company recognized the deposits received from its customers as deferred revenue if the goods or service are associated with a long-term contract. The Company signed a 12-month contract with a client in November of 2021. The total value of that contract was $ 3,000,000 . During the three months ended November 30, 2022, a total of $ 469,697
of deferred revenue was recognized into sales revenue. As of November 30, 2022 the full $3,000,000 of that contract has been recognized and the Company has $ 0
deferred revenue remaining.
9 Table of Contents   Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share —The Company computes income per common share, in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share,  which requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic income or loss per common share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income or loss per common share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the issuance of common shares, if dilutive, that could result from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants. No potential dilutive common shares are included in the computation of any diluted per share amount when a loss is reported.   Fair Value Measurements —ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements , clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:   Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.   Level 2: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.   Level 3: Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.   The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including all current liabilities are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.   Advertising and Promotion — The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising, marketing, and public relations to expense as incurred. The Company has $ 66,244
and $ 308,519

14     Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   Our management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative about our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions about events and trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the sections of our annual report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors”.    Results of Operations
For the Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 and 2021   Revenues For the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021, we had revenues of $1,455,742 and $452,490, respectively. The increase was due to the revenue earned from the two entities that we acquired in 2022 (Alchemy and Helix). Additionally, we entered into a long term contract in November 2021, for which only one month of revenue was earned in the same period in 2021, while two months of revenue were earned in the same period of 2022   Operating Expenses For the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021, we had operating expenses of $1,170,759 and 1,023,006, an increase 14.4%, due to an increase in salaries and wages due to additional staff onboarded in conjunction with the acquisition of Helix and Alchemy. This amount was offset by a decrease in advertising and promotion. There was a decrease in advertising and promotion in the quarter as we focused on building a new product and waiting for that product to be completed before spending significantly on marketing.   Net Loss Our (Net Loss) for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021, was $(971,944) versus $(513,791) respectively. The difference is attributable to an increase in cost of sales attributed to the new business models in the acquisitions of Helix and Alchemy.   Assets and Liabilities Our total current assets decreased to $684,039 from $1,011,896 during the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, compared to August 31, 2022. This decrease was due to cash used for operations and decrease in Accounts Receivables collected.   Total current liabilities decreased to $2,617,213 from $2,974,009 during the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, compared to our year end at August 31, 2022. The decrease reflects a decrease in deferred revenue from $474,977 to $5,280.   Net cash from financing activities decreased to $898,740 as of November 30, 2022 as compared to $1,745,911 for the same period in 2021. The decrease was due to a decrease of proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock and the conversion of Preferred Shares to debt, but partially offset by the proceeds from a new Line of Credit.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Cash used by operating activities   The Company used $1,173,240 in cash from operating activities for the quarter ended November 30, 2022 as compared to a use of $2,012,440 for the quarter ended November 30, 2021. The decrease is due to an improvement in Accounts Receivables and less cash used for Account Payables.     15     Cash provided by investing activities   Net cash from investing activities was $67,330 for the period ended November 30, 2022, as compared to cash used of $65,075 for the period ended November 30, 2021. The increase in net cash is due to the collection of loan receivables from the small business loans provided by Business Warrior Funding.   Cash provided by financing activities   Net cash from financing activities decreased to $898,740 as of November 30, 2022 as compared to $1,745,911 for the same period in 2021. The decrease was due to the exchange of preferred stock for debt.   We currently do not have sufficient capital to fund our cash needs for the next 12 months. We intend to rely on financing from convertible debt, promissory notes, and sale of stock to fund our operations.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Not applicable.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   (a)
Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures”, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934  is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated our company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.   (b)
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Our management, including our principal executive officer and our Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2022. Our management’s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of November 30, 2022 due to the following material weaknesses which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk assessment; (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines; (iii) and inadequate technical skills of accounting personnel. To remediate such weaknesses, we believe we would need to implement the following changes: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. Until we have the required funds, we do not anticipate implementing these remediation steps.     16     A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.   Our principal executive officer does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additional controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.   (c)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended November 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.     17     PART II—OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
