EXPLANATORY
NOTE
Unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Report”)
to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Permex,” and the “Company” are to Permex Petroleum
Corporation., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, and our wholly-owned subsidiary.
Unless
otherwise indicated in this Report, natural gas volumes are stated at the legal pressure base of the state or geographic area in which
the reserves are located at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil and natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of
natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.
The
following definitions shall apply to the technical terms used in this Report.
Terms
used to describe quantities of crude oil and natural gas:
“ Bbl .”
One stock tank barrel, of 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used herein in reference to crude oil, condensate or NGLs.
“ Boe .”
A barrel of oil equivalent and is a standard convention used to express crude oil, NGL and natural gas volumes on a comparable crude
oil equivalent basis. Gas equivalents are determined under the relative energy content method by using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of natural
gas to 1.0 Bbl of crude oil or NGL.
“ MBoe ”
One thousand barrels of oil equivalent.
“ MBbl .”
One thousand barrels of crude oil, condensate or NGLs.
“ Mcf .”
One thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
“ NGLs .”
Natural gas liquids. Hydrocarbons found in natural gas that may be extracted as liquefied petroleum gas and natural gasoline.
Terms
used to describe our interests in wells and acreage:
“ Basin .”
A large natural depression on the earth’s surface in which sediments generally brought by water accumulate.
“ Completion. ”
The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil, NGLs, and/or
natural gas.
“ Developed
acreage. ” Acreage consisting of leased acres spaced or assignable to productive wells. Acreage included in spacing units of
infill wells is classified as developed acreage at the time production commences from the initial well in the spacing unit. As such,
the addition of an infill well does not have any impact on a company’s amount of developed acreage.
“ Development
well. ” A well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil, NGL, or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic
horizon (rock layer or formation) known to be productive for the purpose of extracting proved crude oil, NGL, or natural gas reserves.
“ Differential. ”
The difference between a benchmark price of crude oil and natural gas, such as the NYMEX crude oil spot price, and the wellhead price
received.
“ Dry
hole .” A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of
such production exceed production expenses and taxes.
“ Field .”
An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same individual geological structural
feature or stratigraphic condition. The field name refers to the surface area, although it may refer to both the surface and the underground
productive formations.
“ Formation .”
A layer of rock which has distinct characteristics that differs from nearby rock.
“ Gross
acres or Gross wells. ” The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned.
“ Held
by operations. ” A provision in an oil and gas lease that extends the stated term of the lease as long as drilling operations
are ongoing on the property.
“ Held
by production ” or “ HBP ” A provision in an oil and gas lease that extends the stated term of the lease as
long as the property produces a minimum quantity of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas.
3
Table of Contents
“ Hydraulic
fracturing .” The technique of improving a well’s production by pumping a mixture of fluids into the formation and rupturing
the rock, creating an artificial channel. As part of this technique, sand or other material may also be injected into the formation to
keep the channel open, so that fluids or natural gases may more easily flow through the formation.
“ Infill
well. ” A subsequent well drilled in an established spacing unit of an already established productive well in the spacing unit.
Acreage on which infill wells are drilled is considered developed commencing with the initial productive well established in the spacing
unit. As such, the addition of an infill well does not have any impact on a company’s amount of developed acreage.
“ Net
acres. ” The percentage ownership of gross acres. Net acres are deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working
interests in gross acres equals one (e.g., a 10% working interest in a lease covering 640 gross acres is equivalent to 64 net acres).
“ NYMEX .”
The New York Mercantile Exchange.
“ Productive
well .” A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale
of the production exceed production expenses and taxes.
“ Recompletion .”
The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil, NGLs or natural
gas or, in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.
“ Reservoir .”
A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas that
is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other reservoirs.
“ Spacing .”
The distance between wells producing from the same reservoir. Spacing is often expressed in terms of acres, e.g., 40-acre spacing, and
is often established by regulatory agencies.
“ Undeveloped
acreage .” Leased acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic
quantities of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage includes
net acres held by operations until a productive well is established in the spacing unit.
“ Unit .”
The joining of all or substantially all interests in a reservoir or field, rather than a single tract, to provide for development and
operation without regard to separate property interests. Also, the area covered by a unitization agreement.
“ Wellbore .”
The hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for natural gas production on a completed well. Also called well or borehole.
“ Working
interest .” The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and own crude oil, NGLs, natural gas
or other minerals. The working interest owners bear the exploration, development, and operating costs on either a cash, penalty, or carried
basis.
“Workover.”
Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.
Terms
used to assign a present value to or to classify our reserves:
“ Possible
reserves. ” The additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data suggest are less likely to be recoverable
than probable reserves.
“ Pre-tax
PV-10% or PV-10. ” The estimated future net revenue, discounted at a rate of 10% per annum, before income taxes and with no
price or cost escalation or de-escalation in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”).
“ Probable
reserves. ” The additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered
than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
“ Proved
reserves .” The quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, which, by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing
economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate
expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are
used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
“ Proved
undeveloped reserves ” or “ PUDs .” Proved Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are
limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence
using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations
can be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled
to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are
not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless
such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using
reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

Table of Contents
“ SEC
Pricing ” means pricing calculated using oil and natural gas price parameters established by current guidelines of the SEC and
accounting rules based on the unweighted arithmetic average of oil and natural gas prices as of the first day of each of the 12 months
ended on the given date.
CAUTIONARY
NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
We
desire to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Report
contains a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management’s current views and expectations with respect to our business,
strategies, products, future results and events, and financial performance. All statements made in this Report other than statements
of historical fact, including statements that address operating performance, the economy, events or developments that management expects
or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including the adequacy of funds from operations, cash flows and financing, potential
strategic transactions, statements regarding future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements.
In particular, the words such as “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,”
“may,” “will,” “can,” “plan,” “predict,” “could,” “future,”
“continue,” variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive
means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking.
When
considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the
heading “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. These forward-looking
statements are based on management’s current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of
future events.
Forward-looking
statements may include statements about:
●
our
business strategy;
●
our
reserves;
●
our
financial strategy, liquidity and capital requirements;
●
our
realized or expected natural gas prices;
●
our
timing and amount of future production of natural gas;
●
our
future drilling plans and cost estimates;
●
our
competition and government regulations;
●
our
ability to make acquisitions;
●
general
economic conditions;
●
our
future operating results; and
●
our
future plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.
We
caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict
and many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas. These
risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services,
environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating natural gas reserves
and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital, the timing of development expenditures, and the other
risks described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2022.
Reserve
engineering is a method of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy
of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made
by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of previous estimates.
If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates
may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered.
Should
one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual
results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
All
forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary
statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.
Except
as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified
by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any
public statements or disclosures by us following this Report that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in
this Report will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Report.

1.
BACKGROUND
Permex
Petroleum Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated on
April 24, 2017
under the laws of British Columbia, Canada and maintains
its head office at Suite 925, 2911 Turtle Creek Blvd, Dallas, Texas, 75219. Its registered office is located at 10 th
floor,
595 Howe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T5. The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, development and production
of oil and gas properties in the United States. The Company’s oil and gas interests are located in Texas and New Mexico, USA. The
Company is listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) under the symbol “OIL” and on the OTCQB under
the symbol “OILCF”.
On
October 26, 2022, the Company’s board of directors approved a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding
common stock at a
1 for 60 ratio , which was effective November 2, 2022. The par value and authorized shares of common stock were not
adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. All issued and outstanding common stock, options, and warrants to purchase common stock
and per share amounts contained in the financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all
periods presented.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of
management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary, which are of a normal and recurring nature,
for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and of the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
These interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 or for
any other interim period or for any other future fiscal year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the Company’s audited financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the Company’s wholly-owned
subsidiary,
Permex Petroleum US Corporation . All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Significant Accounting Policies
(cont’d…)
Going
concern of operations
These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will continue in operation
for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course
of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception in the amount of $ 9,569,606
and has not yet achieved profitable operations.
The Company has been relying on equity financing and loans from related parties to fund its operation in the past. While the Company
has been successful in securing financing to date, there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so in the future. The aforementioned
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that
the financial statements are issued.
Management
plans to fund operations of the Company with its current working capital and through increasing production from its oil and gas leases.
The Company also expects to raise additional funds through equity financings. There are no written agreements in place for such funding
or issuance of securities and there can be no assurance that such will be available in the future. Management believes that this plan
provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.
In
view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent
upon the Company’s ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary
should the Company not continue as a going concern.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on experience, current and expected
future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
Significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) amounts subject to allowances and returns;
(ii) the fair value of assets when determining the existence of impairment factors and the amount of impairment, if any; (iii) the costs
of site restoration when determining decommissioning liabilities; (iv) income taxes receivable or payable; (v) the useful lives of assets
for the purposes of depreciation; (vi) petroleum and natural gas reserves; and (vii) share-based payments. Management evaluates its estimates
and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes
adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial
statements; therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates.
New
accounting standards
There
are not currently any new or pending accounting standards that are expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The
Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents and
trade receivables. The Company’s cash balances sometimes exceed the United States’ Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insurance limits. The Company mitigates this risk by placing its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions
and attempts to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. To date, the Company has not recognized any losses caused
by uninsured balances.
The
majority of the Company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $ 140,497
as of December 31,
2022 (September 30, 2022 - $ 91,928 ). Two customers represented $ 78,451
( 56 %) of the trade receivable balance. The Company routinely assesses
the financial strength of its customers. The non-trade receivable balance consists of goods and services tax (“GST”) recoverable
of $ 44,969 . GST recoverable is due from the Canadian Government. It is in management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed
to significant credit risk. To date, the Company has not recognized any credit losses on its receivables.

MANAGEMENT ’ S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
This
Report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements
are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider
various factors, including the risks outlined at the beginning of this Report under
“ Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements ”
the risks outlined under the heading “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2022 and in our other reports we file with the SEC. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially
from any forward-looking statements.
All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise
noted.
Reserve
engineering is a method of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy
of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made
by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of previous estimates.
If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates
may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered.
Company
Overview
The
Company was incorporated on April 24, 2017 under the laws of British Columbia, Canada.
The Company
is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and gas properties on private,
state and federal land in the United States, primarily in the
Permian Basin which includes the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin.
The Company focuses on acquiring producing assets at a discount to market, increasing production and cash-flow through recompletion and
re-entries, secondary recovery and lower risk infill drilling and development. Currently, the Company owns and operates various oil and
gas properties located in Texas and New Mexico. In addition, the Company holds various royalty interests in 73 wells and 5 permitted
wells across 3,800 acres within the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico. Moreover, the Company has more than 11,700
net acres of producing oil and gas assets, 62 shut-in opportunities, and 17 salt water disposal wells allowing for waterflood secondary
recovery.
Key
activities:
●
On
October 26, 2022, the Company announced the appointment of Melissa Folz P.E. to the Company’s Board of Directors.
●
On
November 2, 2022, the Company effected a 1-for-60 reverse split of the Company’s outstanding common shares. The conversion
and/or exercise prices of our issued and outstanding convertible securities, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding
stock options and warrants, and conversion of our outstanding convertible notes have been adjusted accordingly.
●
On
November 2, 2022, the Company announced an update on the drilling of its PPC Eoff #3 well. The target depth of 8,100 ft (2468 meters)
was achieved, and the casing was run to total depth.

Oil
And Gas Properties
Breedlove
“B” Clearfork Leases - Texas
In
September 2021, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Permex U.S., acquired a 100% Working Interest and an 81.75% Net Revenue Interest
in the Breedlove “B” Clearfork leases located in Martin County, Texas. The Breedlove “B” Clearfork properties
situated in Martin County, Texas are over 12 contiguous sections for a total of 7,870.23 gross and 7,741.67 net acres, of which 98% is
held by production in the core of the Permian Basin. It is bounded on the north by Dawson County, on the east by Howard County, on the
south by Glasscock and Midland Counties, and on the west by Andrews County. There is a total of 25 vertical wells of which 12 are producers,
4 are saltwater disposal wells and 9 that are shut-in opportunities. In January 2022, we began the pilot re-entry on the Carter Clearfork
well #5, which is one of 67 shut-in wells that we currently own. The re-entry involved targeting the Clearfork formation at a depth of
7,200 feet. Due to the high water concentrating in the fluid entry, management will be installing appropriate flow-lines from this well
to the injections wells on the property prior to putting the well back on pump. By doing so management is avoiding unnecessary operating
expenses from water disposal in third party disposal facilities.
Pittcock
Leases - Texas
The
Pittcock Leases are situated in Stonewall County. Stonewall County is in Northwest Texas, in the central part of the North Central Plains
and consists of the Pittcock North property, the Pittcock South property and the Windy Jones Property. It is bounded on the north by
King County, on the east by Haskell County, on the south by Fisher and Jones Counties, and on the west by Kent County. The Pittcock North
property covers 320 acres held by production. There is currently one producing well, ten shut-in wells, two saltwater disposal wells,
and a water supply well. We hold a 100% working interest in the Pittcock North Property and an 81.25% net revenue interest. The Pittcock
South property covers 498 acres in four tracts. There are currently 19 shut-in wells and two saltwater disposal wells. We hold a 100%
working interest in the lease and a 71.90% net revenue interest. The Windy Jones Property consists of 40 acres and includes two injection
wells and two suspended oil wells. The sole purpose of the Windy Jones property is to provide waterflood to the offset wells being the
Pittcock wells located east boundary of the Windy Jones Property. We hold a 100% working interest in the Windy Jones Property and a 78.9%
net revenue interest.
Mary
Bullard Property - Texas
We
acquired the Mary Bullard Property in August 2017 for a cash consideration of approximately $50,000. The Mary Bullard Property is located
in Stonewall County, about 5 ½ miles south west of Aspermont, Texas. It is bounded on the north by King County, on the east by
Haskell County, on the south by Fisher and Jones Counties, and on the west by Kent County. The asset is situated on the Eastern Shelf
of the Midland Basin in the central part of the North Central Plains. The Mary Bullard Property covers 241 acres held by production and
is productive in the Clearfork formation at a depth of approximately 3,200 feet. There is currently one producing well, four shut-in
wells, and two water injection wells. We hold a 100% working interest in the Mary Bullard Property and a 78.625% net revenue interest.
West
Henshaw Property - New Mexico
The
West Henshaw Property is located in Eddy County, New Mexico, 12 miles northeast of Loco Hills in the Delaware Basin. Eddy County is in
Southeast New Mexico. It is bounded by Chaves County to the north, Otero County to the east, Loving County, Texas to the south, and Lea
County to the west. The West Henshaw Property covers 1,880 acres held by production. There are two producing wells, seven shut-in wells
and four saltwater disposal wells. We hold a 100% working interest in the West Henshaw Property and a 72% net revenue interest.
In
January 2022, we began the pilot re-entry on the West Henshaw well #15-3, one out of the 67 shut-in wells we currently owns. The re-entry
and re-stimulation involved the West Henshaw property targeting the Grayburg formation at a depth of 2,850 feet. The recompletion was
successful and came online at an initial rate of 30 bopd and has stabilized at 15 bopd.
In
April 2022, we began the re-entry on the West Henshaw well #6-10. The re-entry and re-stimulation involved the West Henshaw property
targeting the Grayburg formation at a depth of 2,850 feet. The recompletion was successful and came online at an initial rate of 15 bopd
and has stabilized at 10 bopd.
The
remaining 67 shut-in wells that we plan to re-enter have potential to yield similar results increasing our total daily production solely
by re-entering shut-in wells.

Interest Properties
During
the year ended September 30, 2021, we acquired royalty interests in 73 producing oil and gas wells located in Texas and New Mexico for
$179,095.
Conversion
of Undeveloped Acreage
The
Company’s process for converting undeveloped acreage to developed acreage is tied to whether there is any drilling being conducted
on the acreage in question. The Company has started development and conversion of its undeveloped acreage located in Martin County, Texas.
The PPC Eoff #3 well, operated by Permex Petroleum, is the first of two permitted wells to be drilled by Permex on the 7,780 gross acre
Breedlove oilfield. Drilling of the first well commenced on September 14, 2022. Management furthermore expects to commence lateral drilling
of the well in May 2023.
An
aggregate of 5,083 MBO and 2,136 MMCF, of the Company’s proved undeveloped reserves as of September 30, 2022, are part of a
development plan that has been adopted by management that calls for these undeveloped reserves to be drilled within the next five
years, thus resulting in the conversion of such proved undeveloped reserves to developed status within five years of initial
disclosure at September 30, 2022. Management currently anticipates spending approximately $10 million in
capital expenditures towards developing the Company’s proved undeveloped reserves during the 2023 fiscal year, subject to the Company
acquiring the necessary financing.
Financing
of Proved and Probable Undeveloped Reserves
The
Company currently estimates that the total cost to develop the Company’s proved undeveloped reserves of 5,083.2 MBbl of oil and
2,136.4 Mcf of natural gas as of September 30, 2022 is $68,818,530. The Company expects to finance these capital costs through a combination
of current cash on hand, debt financing through a line of credit or similar debt instrument, one or more offerings of debt or equity,
and from cash generated from estimated revenues from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company’s wells.
The
Company currently estimates that the total cost to develop the Company’s probable undeveloped reserves of 7,334.3 MBbl of oil and
10,307.1 Mcf of natural gas as of September 30, 2022 is $107,884,900. The Company expects to finance these capital costs through a combination
of joint ventures, farm-in agreements, direct participation programs, one or more offerings of equity, a debt offering or entering into
a line of credit, and from cash generated from estimated revenues from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company’s wells.
Drilling
Activities
The
Company drilled one well during the last three fiscal years. As at December 31, 2022, the Company held leases for 78 gross wells and
had leases and royalty interests in an aggregate of 102 gross productive wells (including 73 wells that we acquired royalty interests
in 2021). The Company’s gross developed acreage totaled 5,177 and net developed acreage totaled 3,942 with the following property

Operating
Results
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported a net loss of $1,309,191 as compared to a net loss of $751,188 for the
three months ended December 31, 2021. The net loss for the first quarter of current fiscal year was mainly attributable to operating
expenses of $1,559,285 compared to operating expenses of $936,719 in the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, being partially offset
by revenue from oil and gas sales and royalty income of $221,942 compared to $106,449 in the fiscal 2022 quarter.
The
Company reported oil and gas sales revenue of $213,754 in the first quarter of the current fiscal year compared with revenue of $89,990
in the same quarter during the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly due to revenue generated from sales of oil and gas extracted
from our Breedlove “B” Clearfork properties, which accounted for 77% of the Company’s oil and gas sales in the current
quarter. The Company also brought West Henshaw wells back online during the second quarter of the last fiscal year. Net oil-equivalent
production by final product sold in the current quarter average 39.38 barrels per day, compared with 21.72 barrels per day in the same
quarter of the previous fiscal year.

The
production expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were $292,679 compared with $81,879 in the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was mostly due to the increase in production in the current quarter compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal
year combined with increased maintenance expenses on the West Henshaw wells.
The
general and administrative expenses excluding share-based payment expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were
$1,214,931, compared with $202,281 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly due to the increase in
property development and corporate activities in general during in the current quarter. Specifically, the variance in the current
quarter from the same quarter in the previous fiscal year was mainly attributable to:
●
Accounting
and audit fees of $319,621, which increased from $14,200 in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year mostly due to increased
property development activities and the increased regulatory compliance work in the United States since the Company became a reporting
company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), in connection with the effectiveness
of a Form S-1 Registration Statement in August 2022.
●
Consulting
fees of $136,825 in the current quarter compared to $13,622 in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, which in the current
quarter related to fees to contract consultants for geological, project management, and general regulatory and corporate consulting
work. The increase in the current quarter from the same quarter in the previous fiscal year was mostly due to the increase in property
development and corporate activities in the current quarter.
●
Legal
fees of $275,194 in the current quarter compared to $5,391 in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, which increased in the
current quarter mostly due to the work related to the Company’s planned uplisting to the NYSE American stock exchange and corresponding
public offering of securities in November 2022 as well as compliance with the disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act in the
United States.
●
Marketing
and promotion expenses of $121,502 in the current quarter compared to $30,452 in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, which
mainly included costs of marketing firms for investor awareness programs and promotion campaigns.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
at December 31, 2022, the Company had a cash balance of $1,693,664, a decrease of $1,606,831 from the cash balance of $3,300,495 on September
30, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $703,492. The Company invested $865,048
in capital expenditures on its oil and gas assets in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, compared to $8,777 invested in the
comparative quarter of the previous fiscal year. The Company also repaid $38,291 of a debenture loan.
The
Company had working capital deficiency of $706,802 as at December 31, 2022 compared to working capital of $2,051,127 as at September
30, 2022.
Management has currently budgeted approximately $10
million in capital expenditures for the 2023 fiscal year, which we plan to finance through a combination of cash on hand, estimated revenues
from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company’s wells, and cash from one or more equity financings and/or a line or
credit. The amount and timing of capital expenditures will depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the speed with which
we are able to drill and complete our wells, our ability to complete an equity financing or to secure a suitable line of credit, commodity
prices, supply/demand considerations and attractive rates of return. There are no guarantees that we will be able to acquire the necessary
funds to meet our budgeted capital expenditures, and any postponement of our planned development of our proved undeveloped reserves could
materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Although the Company has budgeted investments of additional
capital in the continued development of our oil and gas operations, the Company currently does not have any material commitments for capital
expenditures. However, as of the date of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2022, management believes
that the Company may not have sufficient working capital to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements over the next 12 months
and, consequently, the Company is currently evaluating options
to support our funding requirements
over this time period, including but not limited to, completing a financing transaction.
The Company also plans to continue to
monitor the current economic and financial market conditions and evaluate their impact on the Company’s liquidity and future prospects.
Critical
Accounting Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an
ongoing basis and bases its estimates on experience, current and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other
assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction
with the following: (i) amounts subject to allowances and returns; (ii) the fair value of assets when determining the existence of impairment
factors and the amount of impairment, if any; (iii) the costs of site restoration when determining decommissioning liabilities; (iv)
income taxes receivable or payable; (v) the useful lives of assets for the purposes of depreciation; (vi) petroleum and natural gas reserves;
and (vii) share-based payments. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and
other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. These estimates
are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates.

JOBS
Act
On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those
standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards.
Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions,
including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging
growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07
billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering; (iii)
the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which
we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022.
The
following control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting:
●
Insufficient
resources resulting in inadequate segregation of duties in certain accounting functions, the processing and approval of transactions,
due to the size of the accounting department.
●
Lack
of knowledge of US GAAP and ineffective controls associated with the conversion from IFRS to US GAAP
●
Ineffective
controls over inputs used in the valuation of the Asset Retirement Obligation
●
Ineffective
controls on the accounting and the valuation of complex financial instruments
●
Ineffective
review of the financial statements due to the limited financial and reporting resources
●
Ineffective
information technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology
systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes.
Changes
in internal controls
There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
