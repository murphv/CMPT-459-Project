Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 12, 2022.
The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023. Allowance for Credit Losses—Client Receivables and Contract Assets
As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 25,737
and $ 25,786 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets.
Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: February 28, 2023 August 31, 2022 Equity method investments $ 168,812   $ 164,164   Investments without readily determinable fair values 156,439   153,808   Total non-current investments $ 325,251   $ 317,972   For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of February 28, 2023, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 143,700 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately
16 % ownership was $ 400,355 . We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship. On January 9, 2023, Duck Creek Technologies announced an agreement to be acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $ 19.00
per share. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

FORM 10-Q 12 Depreciation and Amortization
As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,694,138
and $ 2,490,187 , respectively.
See table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

We expect to record total business optimization costs of approximately $ 1.5
billion related to these actions, with approximately $ 800
million in fiscal 2023 and $ 700
million in fiscal 2024. This consists of approximately $ 1.2
billion of employee severance and other personnel costs, of which we expect to incur $ 500
million in fiscal 2023 and the remaining $ 700
million in fiscal 2024. The actual amount and timing of costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. Additionally, we expect to incur $ 300
million of costs related to the consolidation of office space, the majority of which is expected to be recorded in fiscal 2023. We recorded $ 244,390
of business optimization costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily for employee severance. Total business optimization costs for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 were $ 176,980
for North America, $ 40,377
for Europe and $ 27,033
for Growth Markets. Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue
See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues.
Remaining Performance Obligations
We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 27
billion and $ 24
billion as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately
52 % of our remaining performance obligations as of February 28, 2023 as revenue in fiscal 2023, an additional
24 % in fiscal 2024, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates
Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022.
Contract Balances
Deferred transition revenues were $ 726,092
and $ 712,715
as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 850,522
and $ 807,940
as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues):
As of February 28, 2023 As of August 31, 2022 Receivables $ 10,997,530   $ 10,484,211   Contract assets (current) 1,501,638   1,292,564   Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 12,499,168   11,776,775   Contract assets (non-current) 75,423   46,844   Deferred revenues (current) 5,112,570   4,478,048   Deferred revenues (non-current) 726,092   712,715   Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the six months ended February 28, 2023 were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors.
Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022 were $ 2.5
billion and $ 3.3
billion, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021 were $ 2.3
billion and $ 3.2

Financial Instruments
Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
Cash Flow Hedges
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Derivatives
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $ 7,431
and net losses of $ 22,260
for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, and net losses of $ 13,048
and $ 36,527
for the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows:
February 28, 2023 August 31, 2022 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 51,224   $ 89,867   Other non-current assets 36,255   69,209   Other Derivatives Other current assets 8,002   8,657   Total assets $ 95,481   $ 167,733   Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 70,908   $ 61,156   Other non-current liabilities 31,003   42,537   Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 42,979   83,792   Total liabilities $ 144,890   $ 187,485   Total fair value $ ( 49,409 ) $ ( 19,752 ) Total notional value $ 11,874,339   $ 11,095,604   We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value.
The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows:

Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 were
20.4 % and
19.2 %, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2023 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments, partially offset by lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. Our effective tax rate for both the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 was

Commitments and Contingencies
Indemnifications and Guarantees
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 1,638,000
and $ 1,349,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 50,000
and $ 49,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 1,143,983
and $ 1,116,298 , respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.
Legal Contingencies
As of February 28, 2023, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we are appealing. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

21 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2023” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2023. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “aspires,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook,” “goal,” “target,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not lim ited to those identified below. Business Risks • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity.
• Our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
• If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
• We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks.
• The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
• Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
• Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and disclosures may expose us to reputational risks and legal liability.
• If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key ecosystem partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
22 Financial Risks • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels.
• Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
• Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
• Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results.
Operational Risks • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and strategy to continue to grow in key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. Legal and Regulatory Risks • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
• Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
• If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. In addition, the timing and amount of costs related to our business optimization actions and the nature and extent of benefits realized from such actions are subject to uncertainties and other factors, including local country consultation processes and regulations, and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.

23 Overview
Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business, particularly with regard to wage inflation and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. In some cases, these conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending. Key Metrics
We saw strong demand across our business in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Key metrics for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 are included below. We have presented operating margin and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or “adjusted” basis to exclude the impact of $244 million in business optimization costs recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” • Revenues of $15.8 billion,
representing
5%
growth in U.S. dollars and
9% growth in
local currency; • New bookings of $22.1 billion,
an increase of 13% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency; • Operating margin of 12.3%,
compared to 13.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022; adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 13.8%; • Diluted earnings per share of $2.39,
compared to $2.54 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022; adjusted earnings per share increased 6% to $2.69; and • Cash returned to shareholders of $1.8 billion,
including share purchases of $1.1 billion and dividends of $708 million. Revenues Three Months Ended Percent

24 Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2023 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Growth Markets and Europe and solid in North America. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Resources, Health & Public Service and Financial Services, strong in Products and flat in Communications, Media & Technology. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in managed services and solid in consulting during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, was relatively stable. In our consulting business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 4% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Consulting revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2023 were flat in U.S. dollars and increased 7% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022. Consulting revenue growth in local currency for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was very strong in Growth Markets, solid in Europe and flat in North America. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our managed services business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Managed services revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2023 increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022. Managed services revenue in local currency for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was driven by very strong growth in Europe, Growth Markets and North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% and 7% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2023, we estimate that our full fiscal 2023 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.5% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. People Metrics Utilization Workforce Annualized Voluntary Attrition 91% 738,000+ 12% compared to 92% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to approximately 699,000 as of February 28, 2022 compared to 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 Utilization for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 91%, compared to 92% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 738,000 as of February 28, 2023, compared to approximately 699,000 as of February 28, 2022. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions.
While we continue to hire, especially to support our strategic growth priorities, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline our operations and transform our non-billable corporate functions to reduce costs. Over the next 18 months, these actions are expected to result in the departure of approximately 19,000 people (or 2.5% of our current workforce), and we expect over half of these departures will consist of people in our non-billable corporate functions.

FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
25 For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 12%, down from 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases become effective December 1 st
of each fiscal year. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has been and continues to increase faster than in prior years. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees. Operating Expenses The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on managed services contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 30.6%, compared with 30.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was 31.7% compared with 31.5% for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel. The increase in gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 16.6% for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared with 16.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 16.5% for the six months ended February 28, 2022. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, Sales and marketing costs increased 50 and 30 basis points, respectively. The increase in Sales and marketing for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023 was due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, General and administrative costs decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenues. During the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, we recorded $244 million in business optimization costs, primarily for employee severance. As part of these business optimization initiatives, we expect to record total costs of approximately $1.5 billion, with approximately $800 million in fiscal 2023 and $700 million in fiscal 2024. The $1.5 billion is expected to consist of $1.2 billion of employee severance and other personnel costs and $300 million related to the consolidation of office space. The actual amount and timing of costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 12.3%, compared with 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was 14.4%, compared with 15.0% for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The business optimization costs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased operating margin by 150 and 80 basis points for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively. Excluding these costs, operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023 increased 10 and 20 basis points to 13.8% and 15.2%, respectively. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 20.4% and 19.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate for both the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 was 22.0%. The business optimization costs of $244 million and related reduction in tax expense of $52 million did not significantly impact our effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 or six months ended February 28, 2023.

26 Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.39 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with $2.54 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Diluted earnings per share were $5.47 for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared with $5.32 for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The $193 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.30 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $2.69 and $5.77 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2023, excluding the impact of the business optimization costs, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.

The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Health and Utilities. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Communications & Media and High Tech. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, Italy and France. • Growth Markets revenues increased 14% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Chemicals & Natural Resources and Public Service. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $884 million, or 7%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.7% compared to 86.3% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to business optimization costs of $244 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Table of Contents ACCENTURE

Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased as a percentage of revenues to 30.6% over 30.1% during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $149 million, or 11%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 9.9% over 9.4% during this period due to higher selling and other business development costs. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $35 million, or 3%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.8% from 7.0% during this period. Business Optimization Costs During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $244 million, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating Income and Operating Margin
Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $117 million, or 6%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 12.3%, compared with 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The business optimization costs decreased operating margin by 150 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 10 basis points to 13.8%.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2022:
• North America operating income decreased as managed services revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs, including an increase in selling and
other
business development costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased due to revenue growth. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth. Interest Income
Interest income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $50 million, an increase of $43 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, other income (expense), net increased $29 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 20.4% and 19.2%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments, partially offset by lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. The business optimization costs of $244 million and related reduction in tax expense of $52 million did not significantly impact our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.39 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with $2.54 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The $193 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.30 during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding this impact, diluted earnings per share were $2.69 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

(1) Costs recorded in connection with our business optimization initiatives, primarily for employee severance. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the six months ended February 28, 2023 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. In addition, during the six months ended February 28, 2023 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant, for the six months ended February 28, 2023 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2022: • North America operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs, including an increase in selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased due to revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Income Interest income for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was $95 million, an increase of $82 million over the six months ended February 28, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the six months ended February 28, 2023, other income (expense), net increased $35 million over the six months ended February 28, 2022, primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements." Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for both the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 was 22.0%. The business optimization costs of $244 million and related reduction in tax expense of $52 million did not significantly impact our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2023.
Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2023 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%, and adjusted annual effective tax rate, which excludes the tax impacts of business optimization costs and an anticipated investment gain, to be in the range of 23% to 25%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $5.47 for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared with $5.32 for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The $193 million business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.30 during the six months ended February 28, 2023. Excluding this impact, diluted earnings per share were $5.77 for the six months ended February 28, 2023.

35 Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of February 28, 2023, Cash and cash equivalents was $6.2 billion, compared with $7.9 billion as of August 31, 2022.
Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:
Six Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,826  $ 2,686  $ 139  Investing activities (1,260) (2,185) 925  Financing activities (3,192) (3,106) (86) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (24) (97) 73  Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,651) $ (2,702) $ 1,051   Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities:
The $139 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income as well as higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, contract assets and deferred revenues), partially offset by higher spending on certain compensation payments. Investing activities:
The $925 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities:
The $86 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
Borrowing Facilities
As of February 28, 2023, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:
(in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility
$ 3,000  $ —  Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,708  —  Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 243  —  Total $ 4,951   $ —   Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $912 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2023. We have a short-term commercial paper financing program backed by our $3 billion syndicated credit facility. As of February 28, 2023, we had no commercial paper outstanding.

(1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.
(2) During the six months ended February 28, 2023, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.
We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2023. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
