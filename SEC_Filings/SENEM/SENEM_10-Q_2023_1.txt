NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.
Basis of Preparation and Presentation
Seneca Foods Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading provider of packaged fruits and vegetables with
26
facilities in
eight
states in support of its operations. The Company’s principal products include canned vegetables, frozen vegetables, jarred fruit, and other food products. The products are sold nationwide by major grocery outlets, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, club stores and dollar stores. Additionally, products are sold to food service distributors, restaurant chains, industrial markets, other food packagers, export customers in
80
countries, and federal, state and local governments for school and other feeding programs.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) applicable to interim financial statements. While these statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of items of a normal recurring nature) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do
not
include all of the information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statement presentation. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statement disclosures in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2022.
Due to the seasonal nature of the business, quarterly operating results and cash flows are
not
necessarily indicative of the results that
may
be expected for other interim periods or the full year. All references to years are fiscal years ended or ending
March 31
unless otherwise indicated. Certain percentage tables
may
not
foot due to rounding. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period classification.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The Company uses the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. A summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Note
1
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2022.
New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies
Effective
April 1, 2022,
the Company adopted ASU
2016 - 13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which was subsequently amended in
November 2018
through ASU
No.
2018 - 19,
Codification Improvements to Topic
326,
Financial Instruments
–
Credit Losses
(“ASU
2016 - 13” ). The amended guidance requires entities to estimate lifetime expected credit losses for trade and other receivables, including those that are current with respect to payment terms, along with other financial instruments which
may
result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The Company evaluated its existing methodology for estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts and the risk profile of its receivables portfolio and developed a model that includes the qualitative and forecasting aspects of the “expected loss” model under the amended guidance. In determining the Company’s reserve for credit losses, receivables are assigned an expected loss based on historical information adjusted for forward-looking economic factors. The adoption of ASU
2016 - 13
did
not
have a material impact to the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
In
March 2020,
the FASB issued ASU
2020 - 04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic
848 ): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
(“ASU
2020 - 04” ). ASU
2020 - 04
provides an optional expedient and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The optional guidance can be applied from
March 12, 2020
through
December 31, 2022.
ASU
2020 - 04
eases the potential accounting burden associated with the expected discontinuance of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates, which are being replaced by alternative reference rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The interest rates associated with the Company’s previous borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility (as defined in Note
7,
“Long-term Debt”) were tied to LIBOR. Subsequent to the amendment of the senior revolving credit facility agreement on
September 14, 2022,
the Company’s borrowings are tied to SOFR plus a spread adjustment (see Note
7,
“Long-term Debt”). The adoption of ASU
2020 - 04
as a result of this amendment did
not
have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognition is completed for most customers at a point in time when product control is transferred to the customer. In general, control transfers to the customer when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer based upon applicable shipping terms, as the customer can direct the use and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset at this point in time. The Company does sell certain finished goods inventory for cash on a bill and hold basis. The terms of the bill and hold agreement provide that title to the specified inventory is transferred to the customer prior to shipment and the Company has the right to payment (prior to physical delivery) which results in recorded revenue as determined under the revenue recognition standard.
In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by product category groups (in thousands):

Inventories
The Company uses the last-in,
first -out (“LIFO”) method of valuing inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each fiscal year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels, production pack yields, sales and the expected rate of inflation or deflation for the year. The interim LIFO calculations are subject to adjustment in the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
As of
December 31, 2022,
January 1, 2022,
and
March 31, 2022,
first -in,
first -out (“FIFO”) based inventory costs exceeded LIFO based inventory costs, resulting in a LIFO reserve of $ 243.8
million, $ 159.3
million, and $ 164.5
million, respectively. In order to state inventories at LIFO, the Company recorded an increase to cost of products sold of $ 30.9
million and $ 19.0
million for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
January 1, 2022,

Assets Held For Sale
The Company classifies its assets as held for sale at the time management commits to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is actively marketed and available for immediate sale, and the sale is expected to be completed within
one
year. Due to market conditions, certain assets
may
be classified as held for sale for more than
one
year as the Company continues to actively market the assets. The Company has non-operating facilities and equipment that meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

Revolving Credit Facility
On
March 24, 2021,
the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement that provides for a senior revolving credit facility of up to $ 400.0
million that is seasonally adjusted (the “Revolver”). Maximum borrowings under the Revolver total $ 300.0
million from
April
through
July
and $ 400.0
million from
August
through
March.
The Revolver balance is included in Long-Term Debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the Revolver’s
March 24, 2026
maturity. In order to maintain availability of funds under the facility, the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver. The Revolver is secured by substantially all of the Company’s accounts receivable and inventories and contains borrowing base requirements as well as a financial covenant, if certain circumstances apply. The Company utilizes its Revolver for general corporate purposes, including seasonal working capital needs, to pay debt principal and interest obligations, and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. Seasonal working capital needs are affected by the growing cycles of the vegetables the Company packages. The majority of vegetable inventories are produced during the months of
June
through
November
and are then sold over the following year. Payment terms for vegetable produce are generally
three
months but can vary from a few days to
seven
months. Accordingly, the Company’s need to draw on the Revolver
may
fluctuate significantly throughout the year.
On
September 14, 2022,
the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amendment”) which amended several provisions to replace LIBOR with SOFR plus a spread adjustment as the interest rate benchmark on the Revolver. The transition to SOFR did
not
materially impact the interest rates applied to the Company’s borrowings.
No
other material changes were made to the terms of the Company’s Revolver as a result of the Amendment.

Term Loan
On
May 28, 2020
the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Guaranty Agreement that provides for a $ 100.0
million unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”), maturing on
June 1, 2025.
The amended and restated agreement converted the Term Loan to a fixed interest rate of
3.3012 % until maturity rather than a variable interest rate in addition to requiring quarterly principal payments of $ 1.0
million, which commenced during fiscal year
2021.
The Company incurred financing costs totaling $ 0.2
million, which have been classified as a discount to the debt. This agreement contains certain covenants, including maintaining a minimum EBITDA and minimum tangible net worth.
Subsequent to
December 31, 2022,
the Company amended the Term Loan and entered into a Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. Refer to Note
15
“Subsequent Events” for additional information.
8.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception of the agreement. Presently, the Company leases land, machinery and equipment under various operating and financing leases.
Right-of-Use, or ROU, assets represent the Company’s right to use the underlying assets for the lease term, and lease obligations represent the net present value of the Company’s obligation to make payments arising from these leases. ROU assets and lease obligations are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term using the implicit lease interest rate or, when unknown, an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date or
April 1, 2019
for leases that commenced prior to that date.
Lease terms
may
include options to extend or terminate the lease, and the impact of these options are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease obligation only when the exercise of the option is at the Company’s sole discretion and it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company will
not
separate lease and non-lease components for its leases when it is impractical to separate the two. In addition, the Company
may
have certain leases that have variable payments based solely on output or usage of the leased asset. These variable operating lease assets are excluded from the Company’s balance sheet presentation and expensed as incurred. Leases with an initial term of
12
months or less, or short-term leases, are
not
recorded on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

0.1 % increase in each of the following as compared to the prior year
nine -month interim period: state income taxes (net of federal benefits), permanent differences, interest and penalties, and other miscellaneous items.

Other Operating Income and Expense
The Company had net other operating expense of $ 0.2
million during the

which was driven primarily by a write down of idle production equipment to estimated selling price, less commission, as the assets met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at
December 31, 2022.
The write down was partially offset by a gain on the sale of an aircraft. During the
three
months ended
January 1, 2022,
the Company had net other operating expense of $ 0.4
million, driven mostly by various miscellaneous expenses related to properties that were classified as held for sale during the prior year interim period.
During the
nine
months ended
December 31, 2022,
the Company had net other operating income of $ 2.4
million, which was driven primarily by a gain on the sale of the Company’s western trucking fleet amongst other fixed assets and a true-up of the supplemental early retirement plan accrual, partially offset by the aforementioned write down of production equipment. During the
nine
months ended
January 1, 2022,
the Company had net other operating expense of $ 0.7
million, driven mostly by a charge for a supplemental early retirement plan offset by a gain on the sale of an aircraft.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS
Seneca Foods Corporation is a leading provider of packaged fruits and vegetables, with facilities located throughout the United States. Our product offerings include canned, frozen and jarred produce and snack chips that are sold under private label as well as national and regional brands that the Company owns or licenses, including Seneca®, Libby’s®, Aunt Nellie’s®, Cherryman®, Green Valley® and READ®. Canned fruits and vegetables are sold nationwide by major grocery outlets, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, club stores and dollar stores. We also sell products to foodservice distributors, restaurant chains, industrial markets, other food processors, export customers in over 80 countries and federal, state and local governments for school and other food programs. Additionally, the Company packs canned and frozen vegetables under contract packing agreements.
Business Trends
We purchase raw materials, including raw produce, steel, ingredients and packaging materials from growers, commodity processors, steel producers and packaging suppliers. Raw materials and other input costs, such as labor, fuel, utilities and transportation, are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors. Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. The cost of raw materials, fuel, labor, distribution and other costs related to our operations can increase from time to time significantly and unexpectedly.
We continue to experience material cost inflation for many of our raw materials and other input costs attributable to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages. While we have no direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine, we have experienced increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the global economy. We attempt to manage cost inflation risks by locking in prices through short-term supply contracts, advance grower purchase agreements, and by implementing cost saving measures. We also attempt to offset rising input costs by raising sales prices to our customers. However, increases in the prices we charge our customers may lag behind rising input costs. Competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to rising costs. To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases our operating results could be materially adversely affected.

Net sales totaled $473.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared with $445.6 million for the three months ended January 1, 2022. The overall net sales increase of $27.7 million, or 6.2%, was predominantly due to higher selling prices contributing favorability of $73.7 million offset by lower sales volumes having an unfavorable impact of $46.0 million to net sales, as compared to the prior year three-month interim period.
Net sales of canned vegetables, frozen vegetables and fruit products increased over the prior year quarter due to higher pricing necessitated by the material cost increases that the Company is experiencing. Volume in each of these product categories is down vs. the prior year quarter partially offsetting a portion of the favorability in net sales generated by increased pricing. Volume in the snack category was up slightly over the prior year quarter and combined with increased pricing contributed to the net sales increase of $0.8 million.

Net sales increased for canned vegetables, frozen vegetables, fruit products, and snack products over the prior year interim period due to higher pricing necessitated by the material cost increases that the Company is experiencing. Volume in each of these product categories is down vs. the prior year quarter partially offsetting a portion of the favorability in net sales generated by increased pricing.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022
Gross margin : Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 11.4% as compared with 10.1% for the three months ended January 1, 2022. The increase in gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to an increase in net sales and favorable sales mix in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a higher LIFO charge. The Company’s LIFO charge for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $30.9 million as compared to a charge of $19.0 million for the three months ended January 1, 2022. The increase in the LIFO reserve over the three months ended December 31, 2022 reflects the projected impact of expected cost increases throughout fiscal year 2023.
Selling, General, and Administrative : Selling, general, and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were 4.6% as compared with 4.7% for the prior year quarter. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales was due to the increase in net sales and the fixed nature of certain expenses.
Other Operating Expense (Income), net : The Company had net other operating expense of $0.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, which was driven primarily by a write down of idle production equipment to estimated selling price, less commission, as the assets met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2022. The write down was partially offset by a gain on the sale of an aircraft. During the three months ended January 1, 2022, the Company had net other operating expense of $0.4 million, driven mostly by various miscellaneous expenses related to properties that were classified as held for sale during the prior year interim period.
Restructuring :
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company ceased production of green beans at one of its New York facilities. As a result, the Company incurred severance costs and a write down of production equipment that will be sold in the next twelve months.
Other Non-Operating Income : Other non-operating income totaled $2.0 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, and is comprised of the non-service related pension amounts that are actuarially determined.
Interest Expense : Interest expense as a percentage of net sales was 0.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 0.3% for the three months ended January 1, 2022. Interest expense increased from $1.5 million in the prior year quarter to $4.3 million for the current quarter as a result of higher interest rates and increased average borrowing levels.

Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022
Gross margin : Gross margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was 10.0% as compared with 11.5% for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to a larger LIFO charge in fiscal year 2023. The Company’s LIFO charge for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $79.3 million as compared to a charge of $30.7 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The increase in the LIFO reserve over the nine months ended December 31, 2022 reflects the projected impact of expected cost increases throughout fiscal year 2023.
Selling, General, and Administrative : Selling, general, and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were 5.1% as compared with 5.5% for the comparable prior year nine-month interim period. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales was due to the increase in net sales and the fixed nature of certain expenses.
Other Operating Expense (Income), net : During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had net other operating income of $2.4 million, which was driven primarily by a gain on the sale of the Company’s western trucking fleet amongst other fixed assets and a true-up of the supplemental early retirement plan accrual, partially offset by the aforementioned write down of production equipment. During the nine months ended January 1, 2022, the Company had net other operating expense of $0.7 million, driven mostly by a charge for a supplemental early retirement plan offset by a gain on the sale of an aircraft.
Loss from Equity Investment :
The Company’s equity investment was written down to $0 in fiscal year 2022 due to an other-than-temporary impairment charge as the investment was determined to not be recoverable. The impairment resulted in a $7.8 million charge during the nine months ended January 1, 2022.
Other Non-Operating Income : Other non-operating income totaled $5.1 million and $7.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, and is comprised of the non-service related pension amounts that are actuarially determined.
Interest Expense : Interest expense as a percentage of net sales was 0.7% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 0.4% for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. Interest expense increased from $4.2 million in the prior year nine-month interim period to $8.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as a result of higher interest rates and increased average borrowing levels. through the first nine months of fiscal year 2023.
Income Taxes :
The Company’s effective tax rate was 23.5% and 23.6% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in the current nine-month interim period primarily due to the impact of federal credits, which reduced the effective rate by 0.5%. The overall effective rate decrease was partially offset by a 0.1% increase in each of the following as compared to the prior year nine-month interim period: state income taxes (net of federal benefits), permanent differences, interest and penalties, and other miscellaneous items.

As shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, net cash used by operating activities was $189.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $11.1 million used by operating activities for the same period of the prior year, a change of $178.4 million. The increase in cash used by operating activities is primarily comprised of an increase in cash used for working capital purposes. Inventories increased by $231.3 million, driven by the increased size of the current year harvest in addition to material cost inflation to various production inputs. The increase in inventory was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other of $28.7 million, income taxes of $13.6 million and accounts receivable of $12.8 million.
Cash used by investing activities was $51.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $31.7 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022, an increase of $19.8 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment increased $20.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period of fiscal 2022, representing the majority of the increase.
Cash provided by financing activities was $242.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $248.7 million compared to cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 of $6.1 million. Entering fiscal year 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $59.8 million on hand to use for seasonal pack needs prior to borrowing on the Revolver as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million entering fiscal year 2023. Additionally, cost inflation in fiscal year 2023 is higher than the prior year driving seasonal borrowings for the pack higher as compared to the prior year. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed $783.3 million and paid down $493.0 million, providing net cash of $290.3 million, which was a change of $260.6 million compared to the comparable prior year period. Other than borrowings under the Revolver, there was no new long-term debt during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. Additionally, during the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, the Company repurchased $41.2 million of its common stock, the majority of which was done through a stock repurchase program that was authorized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. By comparison, the Company repurchased $27.8 million during the nine months ended January 1, 2022, an increase in cash used by financing activities of $13.4 million over the comparable prior year period.
On March 24, 2021, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement that provides for a senior revolving credit facility of up to $400.0 million that is seasonally adjusted (the “Revolver”). Maximum borrowings under the Revolver total $300.0 million from April through July and $400.0 million from August through March. The Revolver balance is included in Long-Term Debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the Revolver’s March 24, 2026 maturity. In order to maintain availability of funds under the facility, the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver. The Revolver is secured by substantially all of the Company’s accounts receivable and inventories and contains borrowing base requirements as well as a financial covenant, if certain circumstances apply. The Company utilizes its Revolver for general corporate purposes, including seasonal working capital needs, to pay debt principal and interest obligations, and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. Seasonal working capital needs are affected by the growing cycles of the vegetables the Company packages. The majority of vegetable inventories are produced during the months of June through November and are then sold over the following year. Payment terms for vegetable produce are generally three months but can vary from a few days to seven months. Accordingly, the Company’s need to draw on the Revolver may fluctuate significantly throughout the year.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS
On September 14, 2022, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amendment”) which amended several provisions to replace LIBOR with SOFR plus a spread adjustment as the interest rate benchmark on the Revolver. The transition to SOFR did not materially impact the interest rates applied to the Company’s borrowings. No other material changes were made to the terms of the Company’s Revolver as a result of the Amendment.
The Company’s credit facilities contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, and certain affirmative and negative covenants, including various financial covenants. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.
Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company amended the Term Loan and entered into a Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. Refer to Note 15 “Subsequent Events” for additional information.
Impact of Seasonality on Financial Position and Results of Operations:
While individual vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production and sales, the different cycles are somewhat offsetting. Minimal food packaging occurs in the Company's last fiscal quarter ending March 31, which is the optimal time for maintenance, repairs and equipment changes in its packaging plants. The supply of commodities, current pricing, and expected new crop quantity and quality affect the timing and amount of the Company’s sales and earnings. When the seasonal harvesting periods of the Company's major vegetables are newly completed, inventories for these packaged vegetables are at their highest levels. For peas, the peak inventory time is mid-summer and for corn and green beans, the Company's highest volume vegetables, the peak inventory is in mid-autumn. The seasonal nature of the Company’s production cycle results in inventory and accounts payable reaching their lowest point late in the fourth quarter/early in the first quarter prior to the new seasonal pack commencing. As the seasonal pack progresses, these components of working capital both increase until the pack is complete. Given the material cost increases incurred to date in fiscal year 2023, both inventory and accounts payable are higher than prior year levels as of December 31, 2022.
The Company’s fruit and vegetable sales exhibit seasonal increases in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to increased retail demand during the holiday seasons. In addition, the Company sells canned and frozen vegetables to a co-pack customer on a bill and hold basis at the end of each pack cycle, which typically occurs during the second and third quarters. The seasonal nature of the Company’s sales, particularly holiday driven retail sales, result in the accounts receivable balance reaching its highest point at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters, while typically being the lowest at the end of the first quarter. One of the ways we attempt to offset material cost increases incurred is to increase selling prices, which resulted in a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to the prior year as of December 31, 2022.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
Certain disclosures in this report include non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of our financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and related condensed consolidated statements of net earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows.
Adjusted net earnings is calculated on a FIFO basis and excludes the impact of the Company’s loss on equity investment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides for a better comparison of year over year operating performance. The Company does not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS
New Accounting Standards
Refer to Note 1 “Basis of Preparation and Presentation.”
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Revenue Recognition and Trade Promotion Expenses : Revenue recognition is completed for most customers at a point in time basis when product control is transferred to the customer. In general, control transfers to the customer when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer based upon applicable shipping terms, as the customer can direct the use and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset at this point in time. The Company sells certain finished goods inventory for cash on a bill and hold basis. The terms of the bill and hold agreement provide that title to the specified inventory is transferred to the customer prior to shipment and the Company has the right to payment (prior to physical delivery) which results in recorded revenue as determined under the revenue recognition standard.
Trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of the Company’s branded products and are critical to the support of the business. Trade promotion costs, which are recorded as a reduction of net sales, include amounts paid to encourage retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of the Company’s products to consumers, amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retail stores, and amounts paid to retailers for shelf space in retail stores. Accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the retailer based on expected levels of performance. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a retailer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. As a result, the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by retailers for amounts they consider due to them. Final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time.
Inventories : The Company uses the lower of cost, determined under the LIFO method, or market, to value substantially all of its inventories. In the high inflation environment that the Company is experiencing, the Company believes that the LIFO method was preferable over the FIFO method because it better matches the cost of current production to current revenue. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each fiscal year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. In contrast, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels, production pack yields, sales and the expected rate of inflation or deflation for the year. The interim LIFO calculations are subject to adjustment in the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
Long-Lived Assets : The Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment whenever there is an indicator of impairment. Property, plant, and equipment are depreciated over their assigned lives. The assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective. If actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated, a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal of the assets could be incurred. Impairment losses are evaluated if the estimated undiscounted value of the cash flows is less than the carrying value. If such is the case, a loss is recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value.
Income Taxes : As part of the income tax provision process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates income taxes. This process involves estimating current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company then assesses the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it is believed the recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established.
Pension Expense : The Company has a defined benefit plan which is subject to certain actuarial assumptions. The funded status of the pension plan is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates, employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality, and the rate of salary increases. Certain assumptions reflect the Company's historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations.
