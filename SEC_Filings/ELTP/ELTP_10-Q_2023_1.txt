SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Overview
Elite
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company” or “Elite”) was incorporated on October 1, 1997 under the laws of the State
of Delaware, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Elite Laboratories, Inc. (“Elite Labs”) was incorporated on August 23, 1990
under the laws of the State of Delaware. On January 5, 2012, Elite Pharmaceuticals was reincorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada. Elite Labs engages primarily in researching, developing, licensing and manufacture of generic, oral dose pharmaceuticals. The
Company is equipped to manufacture controlled-release products on a contract basis for third parties and itself, if and when the product
candidates are approved. These products include drugs that cover therapeutic areas for allergy, bariatric, attention deficit and infection.
Research and development activities are performed with an objective of developing product candidates that will secure marketing approvals
from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and thereafter, commercially exploiting such products.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Labs. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items,
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of such statements. The results of operations for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.
Segment
Information
Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 280 (“ASC 280”),
Segment Reporting ,
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making
group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The
Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews the financial performance and the results
of operations of the segments prepared in accordance with GAAP when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance
of the Company.
The
Company has determined that its reportable segments are products whose marketing approvals were secured via an Abbreviated New Drug Applications
(“ANDA”) and products whose marketing approvals were secured via a New Drug Application (“NDA”). ANDA products
are referred to as generic pharmaceuticals and NDA products are referred to as branded pharmaceuticals.
There
are currently no intersegment revenues. Asset information by operating segment is not presented below since the chief operating decision
maker does not review this information by segment. The reporting segments follow the same accounting policies used in the preparation
of the Company’s condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements. Please see Note 15 for further details.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company generates revenue primarily from manufacturing and licensing fees. Manufacturing fees include the development of pain management
products, manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved ANDA, through the manufacture of formulations and
the development of new products. Licensing fees include the commercialization of products either by license and the collection of royalties,
or the expansion of licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other
collaborations.

Under
ASC 606,
Revenue from Contacts with Customers
(“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains
control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which is expected to be received in exchange for
those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASC 606: (i) identify contract(s)
with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the
transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance
obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined
to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that
are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the
amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is
satisfied. Sales, value add, and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.
Nature
of goods and services
The
following is a description of the Company’s goods and services from which the Company generates revenue, as well as the nature,
timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and significant payment terms for each, as applicable:
a)
Manufacturing Fees
The
Company is equipped to manufacture controlled-release products on a contract basis for third parties, if, and when, the products are
approved. These products include products using controlled-release drug technology. The Company also develops and markets (either on
its own or by license to other companies) generic and proprietary controlled-release pharmaceutical products.
The
Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product based on the contractual shipping terms of
the contract. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the product, is responsible to ensure that the
product is produced in accordance with the related supply agreement and bears risk of loss while the inventory is in-transit to the commercial
partner. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products to a
customer.
b)
License Fees
The
Company enters into licensing and development agreements, which may include multiple revenue generating activities, including milestones
payments, licensing fees, product sales and services. The Company analyzes each element of its licensing and development agreements in
accordance with ASC 606 to determine appropriate revenue recognition. The terms of the license agreement may include payment to the Company
of licensing fees, non-refundable upfront license fees, milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved, and/or royalties on
product sales.
If
the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation.
Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative
standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company determines standalone
selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable
through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market
conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
The
Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable upfront payments at a point in time, typically upon fulfilling the delivery of the associated
intellectual property to the customer. For those milestone payments which are contingent on the occurrence of particular future events
(for example, payments due upon a product receiving FDA approval), the Company determined that these need to be considered for inclusion
in the calculation of total consideration from the contract as a component of variable consideration using the most-likely amount method.
As such, the Company assesses each milestone to determine the probability and substance behind achieving each milestone. Given the inherent
uncertainty of the occurrence of future events, the Company will recognize revenue from the milestone when there is not a high probability
of a reversal of revenue, which typically occurs near or upon achievement of the event.

PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Significant
management judgment is required to determine the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company
expects to complete its performance obligations under the arrangement. If the Company cannot reasonably estimate when its performance
obligations either are completed or become inconsequential, then revenue recognition is deferred until the Company can reasonably make
such estimates. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method.
When
determining the transaction price of a contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before
or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. Applying the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18,
the Company does not assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period between when the Company performs its obligations
under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less. None of the Company’s contracts contained a significant financing
component as of December 31, 2022.
In
accordance with ASC 606-10-55-65, royalties are recognized when the subsequent sale of the customer’s products occurs.
The
Company entered into a sales and distribution licensing agreement with Epic Pharma LLC, (“Epic”) dated June 4, 2015 (the
“2015 Epic License Agreement”), which has been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative agreement,
and is accounted for accordingly. The 2015 Epic License Agreement expired on June 4, 2020 without renewal.
The
Company entered into a Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC dated August 24, 2016 (the “SunGen Agreement”),
which has been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative agreement, and is accounted for accordingly. On
April 3, 2020, Elite and SunGen mutually agreed to discontinue any further joint product development activities.

Restricted
Cash
As
of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 405,164
and $ 405,039 , of restricted cash, respectively, related to debt service
reserve in regard to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (“NJEDA”) bonds (see Note 6).
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable are comprised of balances due from customers, net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability,
historical trends are evaluated, and specific customer issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances.
Inventory
Inventory
is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on specific identification by lot number basis.
Long-Lived
Assets
The
Company periodically evaluates the fair value of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and intangibles, whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets which range from
three
to
forty years . Major repairs or improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements and maintenance and repairs
which do not improve or extend asset lives are expensed currently.
Upon
retirement or other disposition of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting
gain or loss, if any, is recognized in income.
Intangible
Assets
The
Company capitalizes certain costs to acquire intangible assets; if such assets are determined to have a finite useful life they are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Costs to acquire indefinite lived intangible assets, such as costs related to
ANDAs are capitalized accordingly.
The
Company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually (as of March 31st) and whenever events or circumstances change that
indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has
occurred. Such indicators may include, among others and without limitation: a significant decline in the Company’s expected future
cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change
in legal factors or in the business climate of the Company’s segments; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company did not identify any indicators of impairment.
Please
also see Note 4 for further details on intangible assets.
Research
and Development
Research
and development expenditures are charged to expense as incurred.
Contingencies
Occasionally,
the Company may be involved in claims and legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of its business. The Company records a provision
for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
If these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on the Company’s condensed
consolidated financial statements. Contingencies are inherently unpredictable, and the assessments of the value can involve a series
of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.

Income
Taxes
Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Where applicable, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
any deferred tax assets that it determines will not be realizable in the future.
The
Company recognizes the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or expects to take on income tax returns it files if such
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
These tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution .
The
Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions within the United States of America. The Company remains subject to examination in all
tax jurisdiction until the applicable statutes of limitation expire. As of December 31, 2022, a summary of the tax years that remain
subject to examination in our major tax jurisdictions are: United States – Federal, 2016 and forward. The Company did not record
unrecognized tax positions for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Warrants
and Preferred Shares
The
accounting treatment of warrants and preferred share series issued is determined pursuant to the guidance provided by ASC 470,
Debt ,
ASC 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , and ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging , as applicable. Each feature of a
freestanding financial instrument including, without limitation, any rights relating to subsequent dilutive issuances, dividend issuances,
equity sales, rights offerings, forced conversions, optional redemptions, automatic monthly conversions, dividends and exercise is assessed
with determinations made regarding the proper classification in the Company’s financial statements.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,
Compensation-Stock Compensation . Under the fair value
recognition provisions, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized
as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the terms of the awards. The cost of the stock-based
payments to nonemployees that are fully vested and non-forfeitable as at the grant date is measured and recognized at that date, unless
there is a contractual term for services in which case such compensation would be amortized over the contractual term.
In
accordance with the Company’s Director compensation policy and certain employment contracts, director’s fees and a portion
of employee’s salaries are to be paid via the issuance of shares of the Company’s Common Stock (“Common Stock”),
in lieu of cash, with the valuation of such share being calculated on a quarterly basis and equal to the average closing price of the
Company’s Common Stock.
Sale
of ANDA
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Pyros Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Pyros”)
pursuant to which the Company sold to Pyros its rights in and to the Company’s approved abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)
for its generic Sabril drug. The Company sold its rights to Pyros for $ 1,000,000 , which was recorded as gain on sale of ANDA during the
nine months ended December 31, 2022. There is no further action required by the Company regarding the rights which would affect future
periods.
In
conjunction with the sale of its Product to Pyros, the Company executed a Manufacturing and Supply agreement (the “Pyros Agreement”)
with Pyros. Under the terms of the Pyros Agreement, the Company will receive an agreed-upon price per drug for the manufacturing and
packaging of Sabril over a term of three years. Revenue per the Pyros Agreement will be recognized as control of the manufactured and
supplied drugs is transferred to Pyros (at the time of delivery).
Earnings
Per Share Attributable to Common Shareholders ’
The
Company follows ASC 260,
Earnings Per Share , which requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”)
on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and
denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In the accompanying financial
statements, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share does not include the conversion of securities that would have an antidilutive
effect.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
ASC
820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”) provides a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market
participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s
own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable
inputs).
The
fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy under ASC 820 are described as follows:
●
Level
1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
●
Level
2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset
or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
●
Level
3 – Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.

The
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other
current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Based upon current borrowing rates with similar maturities the carrying value of long-term debt approximates fair value.
Non-Financial

Non-financial
assets such as intangible assets, and property and equipment are measured at fair value only when an impairment loss is recognized. The

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments . This update requires immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (“CECL”).
Under the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred. The new model is applicable to all financial instruments that
are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022
for public entities qualifying as smaller reporting companies. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact
of this update on the consolidated financial statements and does not expect a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Management
has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant
impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating
Leases
The
Company entered into an operating lease for a portion of a one-story warehouse, located at 135 Ludlow Avenue, Northvale, New Jersey (the
“Ludlow Ave. lease”) which began in 2010. On June 30, 2021, the Company exercised a renewal option, with such option including
a term that begins on January 1, 2022 and expires on December 31, 2026. The Ludlow Ave. lease was terminated on July 1, 2022, when the
Company purchased the underlying property.
In
October 2020, the Company entered into an operating lease for office space in Pompano Beach, Florida (the “Pompano Office Lease”).
The Pompano Office Lease is for approximately
1,275
square feet of office space, with Elite taking occupancy on November 1, 2020. The
Pompano Office has a term of three years, ending on October 31, 2023.
The
Company assesses whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain
a lease that is accounted for separately, the Company determines the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset
and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use. The Company
has elected to account for non-lease components associated with its leases and lease components as a single lease component.
The
Company recognizes a right-of-use asset, which represents the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and
a lease liability, which represents the present value of the Company’s obligation to make payments arising over the lease term.
The present value of the lease payments is calculated using either the implicit interest rate in the lease or an incremental borrowing
rate.

increases, annually, the liability related to this obligation. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized
cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, the Company records either a gain or
loss. As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, the Company had a liability of $ 0

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities .
The
Company issued warrants, with a term of ten years, to affiliates in connection with an exchange agreement dated April 28, 2017, as further
described in this note below. The warrant share balance is
79,008,661
as of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022 with a weighted average
exercise price of $ 0.1521
as of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022.
On
April 28, 2017, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with Nasrat Hakim (“Hakim”), the Chairman of the Board, President,
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, pursuant to which the Company issued to Hakim
24.0344
shares of its Series J Preferred and
warrants to purchase an aggregate of
79,008,661
shares of its Common Stock (the “Series J Warrants” and, along with the Series
J Preferred issued to Hakim, the “Securities”) in exchange for
158,017,321
shares of Common Stock owned by Hakim. The fair
value of the Series J Warrants was determined to be $ 6,474,674
upon issuance at April 28, 2017.
The
Series J Warrants are exercisable for a period of
10
years from the date of issuance, commencing April 28, 2020. The initial exercise
price is $ 0.1521
per share and the Series J Warrants can be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis. The exercise price is subject
to adjustment for any issuances or deemed issuances of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents at an effective price below the then
exercise price. Such exercise price adjustment feature prohibits the Company from being able to conclude the warrants are indexed to
its own stock and thus such warrants are classified as liabilities and measured initially and subsequently at fair value. The Series
J Warrants also provide for other standard adjustments upon the occurrence of certain customary events.

SEGMENT RESULTS
FASB
ASC 280-10-50 requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach is based on
the way a company’s management organized segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which
management disaggregates a company.
The
Company has determined that its reportable segments are ANDAs for generic products and NDAs for branded products. The Company identified
its reporting segments based on the marketing authorization relating to each and the financial information used by its chief operating
decision maker to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to and the financial performance of the reporting segments.
Asset
information by operating segment is not presented below since the chief operating decision maker does not review this information by
segment. The reporting segments follow the same accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company’s unaudited condensed

May 2020, SunGen Pharma LLC (“SunGen”), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, assigned its rights and obligations under
the SunGen Agreement for Amphetamine IR and Amphetamine ER to Mikah Pharmaceuticals. The ANDAs for Amphetamine IR and Amphetamine ER
are now registered under Elite’s name. Mikah will now be Elite’s partner with respect to Amphetamine IR and ER and will assume
all the rights and obligations for these products from SunGen. Mikah Pharmaceuticals was founded in 2009 by Nasrat Hakim, a related party
and the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.
In
June 2021, the Company entered into a development and license agreement with Mikah Pharma LLC, pursuant to which Mikah Pharma LLC will
engage in the research, development, sales and licensing of generic pharmaceutical products. In addition, Mikah Pharma LLC will collaborate
to develop and commercialize generic products including formulation development, analytical method development, manufacturing, sales
and marketing of generic products. Initially two generic products were identified for the parties to develop.

INCOME TAXES
The
Company’s effective tax rate was
11.5 % and income tax expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 50,837 . The Company’s
effective tax rate was
10.75 % and income tax expense was $ 4,000
for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The Company has evaluated its
deferred tax assets, specifically its net operating loss carryovers, for realizability and has provided a valuation allowance on the
majority of its deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance is the reason that the effective tax rate and income tax expense are different
than the statutory rate of
21 %.

COVID-19 UPDATE
In
December 2019, the Novel Corona Virus, COVID-19 was reported to have emerged in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization
(“WHO”) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Governments at the national, state and local level in the United
States, and globally, have implemented aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the virus, with such actions including, without limitation,
lockdown and shelter in place orders, limitations on non-essential gatherings of people, suspension of all non-essential travel, and
ordering certain businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations. Under current and applicable
laws and regulations, the Company’s business is deemed essential and it has continued to operate in all aspects of its pharmaceutical
manufacturing, distribution, product development, regulatory compliance and other activities. The Company’s management has developed
and implemented a range of measures to address the risks, uncertainties, and operational challenges associated with operating in a COVID-19
environment. The Company is closely monitoring the rapidly evolving and changing situation and are implementing plans intended to limit
the impact of COVID-19 on our business so that the Company can continue to manufacture those medicines used by end user patients. Actions
the Company has taken to date are, without limitation, further described below.

Workforce
The
Company has taken and will continue to take, proactive measures to provide for the well-being of its workforce while continuing to safely
produce pharmaceutical products. The Company has implemented alternative working practices, which include, without limitation, modified
schedules, shift rotation and work at home abilities for appropriate employees to best ensure adequate social distancing. In addition,
the Company increased its already thorough cleaning protocols throughout its facilities and has prohibited visits from non-essential
visitors. Certain of these measures have resulted in increased costs.
Manufacturing
and Supply Chain
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has not experienced material,
detrimental issues related to COVID-19 in its manufacturing, supply chain, quality assurance and regulatory compliance activities, and
has been able to operate without interruption. The Company has taken, and plans to continue to take, commercially practical measures
to keep its facilities open. The Company’s supply chains remain intact and operational, and the Company is in regular communications
with its suppliers and third-party partners. A prolonging of the current situation relating to COVID-19 may result in an increased risk
of interruption in the Company supply chain in the future, with no assurances given as the materiality of such future interruption on
the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
should
be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included
elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties,
such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors
appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
“plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,”
“intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar expressions to identify
forward-looking statements.
Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Elite”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”,
and “our” refer to Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiary.
Background
Elite
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”, “Elite”, “Elite Pharmaceuticals”, the
“registrant”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated on October 1, 1997 under the laws
of the State of Delaware, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Laboratories, Inc. (“Elite Labs”), was incorporated on August
23, 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware. On January 5, 2012, Elite Pharmaceuticals was reincorporated under the laws of the
State of Nevada.
We
are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using
proprietary know-how and technology for the manufacture of generic pharmaceuticals. Our strategy includes developing generic versions
of controlled-release drug products with high barriers to entry.
We
occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ (the “Northvale
Facility”) . The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) and is a United States
Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) registered facility for research, development and manufacturing. We are also party to an
operating lease for office space at Pompano Beach, Florida (the “Pompano Office Lease”).
Strategy
We
focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New
Drug Applications (“ANDAs”); (ii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iii) development of the other
products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (iv) commercial exploitation of our products either by license and
the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (v) development of new products and the expansion of
our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.
Our
focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including generic drug products which require ANDAs as well as branded
drug products which require New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition
and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Drug Price Competition Act”).
We
believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes generic products
in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources
thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.

Recent
Developments
Pyros
Agreement
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Pyros Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Pyros”)
pursuant to which the Company sold to Pyros its rights in and to the Company’s approved abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)
for its generic Sabril drug. The Company sold its rights to Pyros for $1,000,000, which was recorded as gain on sale of ANDA during the
nine months ended December 31, 2022. There is no further action required by the Company regarding the rights which would affect future
periods.
In
conjunction with the sale of its Product to Pyros, the Company executed a Manufacturing and Supply agreement (the “Pyros Agreement”)
with Pyros. Under the terms of the Pyros Agreement, the Company will receive an agreed-upon price per drug for the manufacturing and
packaging of Sabril over a term of three years. Revenue per the Pyros Agreement will be recognized as control of the manufactured and
supplied drugs is transferred to Pyros (at the time of delivery).
Notice
of Termination of License, Supply and Distribution Agreement

Approved
Products Not Yet Commercialized
Acetaminophen
and Codeine Phosphate
The
Company received approval on September 10, 2019 from the FDA of an ANDA for a generic version of Tylenol® with Codeine (acetaminophen
and codeine phosphate). Acetaminophen with codeine is a combination medication indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain,
where treatment with an opioid is appropriate and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. The Company is not pursuing licensing
deals for any opioids at this time and, in light of the current market and litigation around opioid products, the Company has no plans
to commercialize this product at this time.
The
Company received approval on June 27, 2022 from the FDA of an ANDA for a generic version of Sabril® (Vigabatrin USP) 500 mg powder
for solution packet. Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic drug indicated for refractory complex partial seizures and used as an adjunctive
therapy in patients who have inadequately responded to several alternative treatments. We are evaluating potential commercial opportunities.
The
Company received approval on April 4, 2022 from the FDA of an ANDA for a generic version of Doxycycline (doxycycline hyclate) 100mg tablets.
Doxycycline hyclate is an antibiotic that is used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. This product was co-developed and
co-owned by Elite and Praxgen Pharmaceuticals LLC, formerly SunGen Pharma LLC. We are evaluating potential commercial opportunities.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP, and our discussion
and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and
estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results
may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.
There
were no significant changes during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 to the items that we disclosed as our significant accounting
policies and estimates described in “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Company’s financial
statements as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.

Total
revenues for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.28 million or 3%, to $9.25 million, as compared to $8.97
million, for the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily due to the increased sales of Amphetamine IR Tablets and Amphetamine
ER Capsules during the three month period ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.
Manufacturing
fees increased by $0.13 million, or 2%, primarily due to increased sales of Amphetamine IR Tablets and Amphetamine ER Capsules during
the three month period ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.
Licensing
fees increased by $0.14 million, or 11%. This increase is primarily due to licensing fees earned from the sale of Amphetamine ER Capsules
and Amphetamine IR Tablets during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.
Costs
of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our costs of revenue decreased by $0.63 million or 13%, to $4.33 million as
compared to $4.96 million for the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. This decrease was due in large part to an improved margin
on products sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.

and development costs during the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $1.4 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 51%, from approximately
$1.0 million of such costs for the comparable period of the prior year. The increase was a result of the timing and nature of product
development activities during the three month period ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal
year.
General
and administrative expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $1.2 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 28% from
$0.9 million of such costs for the comparable period of the prior year due to increased spending in payroll and professional expense.

in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Please note that the change
in the fair value of derivative instruments is determined in large part by the change in the closing price of the Company’s Common
Stock as of the end of the period, as compared to the closing price at the beginning of the period, with a strong inverse relationship
between the fair value of our derivatives instruments and decreases in the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock. Please

The
increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the increased interest payments related to the loan and mortgage the Company
obtained from East West Bank.

a result of the foregoing, our net income before the net benefit from sale of net operating loss credits for the three months ended December
31, 2022 was $3.0 million, compared to net income $2.3 million for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The
term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, refers to controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s
management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance
level.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Internal
control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are achieved. Further, the design
of a control system must be balanced against resource constraints, and therefore the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Given the inherent limitations in all systems of controls, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly,
given the inherent limitations in a cost-effective system of internal control, financial statement misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and may not be detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
of achieving their objectives. We conduct periodic evaluations of our systems of controls to enhance, where necessary, our control policies
and procedures.
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)”
published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report.
