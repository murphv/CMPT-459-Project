Note 1 -
Nature of business and organization
iPower Inc., formerly known as BZRTH Inc., a
Nevada corporation (the “Company”), was incorporated on April 11, 2018. The Company is a U.S.-based online seller and
supplier of consumer home, garden and pet products.
Effective on March 1, 2020, as amended and restated
pursuant to an agreement dated October 26, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with E Marketing Solution Inc. (“E Marketing”),
an entity incorporated in California and owned by one of the shareholders of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the
Company agreed to provide technical support, management services and other services on an exclusive basis in relation to E Marketing’s
business during the term of the agreement. The Company also agreed to fund E Marketing for operational cash flow needs and bear the risk
of E Marketing’s losses from operations and E Marketing agreed that iPower has rights to E Marketing’s net profits, if any.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company may at any time, at its option, acquire for nominal consideration 100% of either the equity
of E Marketing or its assets subject to assumption of all of its liabilities. E Marketing was considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”).
On May 18, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the equity ownership of E Marketing. As a result, E Marketing has become the Company’s
wholly owned subsidiary.
On September 4, 2020, the Company entered into an
agreement with Global Product Marketing Inc. (“GPM”), an entity incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 4, 2020.
GPM was then wholly owned by Chenlong Tan, the Chairman, CEO and President and one of the majority shareholders of the Company. Pursuant

flow needs and bear the risk of GPM’s losses from operations and GPM agreed that the Company has the right to GPM’s net profits,

On May 18, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the equity ownership of GPM. As a result, GPM has become the Company’s wholly owned
subsidiary.
On January 13, 2022, the
Company entered into a joint venture agreement and formed a Nevada limited liability company, Box Harmony, LLC (“Box Harmony”),
for the principal purpose of providing logistics services primarily for foreign-based manufacturers or distributors who desire to sell
their products online in the United States, with such logistics services to include, without limitation, receiving, storing and transporting
such products. The Company owns 40% of the equity interest in Box Harmony, retaining significant influence, but does not own a majority
equity interest or otherwise control of Box Harmony. See details on Note 3 below.
On February 10, 2022, the

Note 2 –
Basis of Presentation and Summary
of significant accounting policies
Basis of Presentation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and VIE and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally
required by U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the
same basis as its annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only
of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for the fair statement of the Company’s financial information. These interim
results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, or for any other interim
period or for any other future year. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the
Company’s Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2022, which are included in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September
28, 2022.
Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, E Marketing Solution Inc., Global Product Marketing Inc., Global Social Media,
LLC, and Anivia Limited and its subsidiaries and VIE, including Fly Elephant Limited, Dayourenzai (Shenzhen) Technology Co., Ltd., and
Daheshou (Shenzhen) Information Technology Co., Ltd. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The company is an “emerging growth company,”
as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart
our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting
requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being
required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts
emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that
is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered
under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company
can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but
any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that
when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the company, as an emerging
growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison
of the company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth
company which has opted out of utilizing the emerging growth company reduced reporting requirements.
Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the periods presented. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at
the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one
or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

Foreign currency translation and transactions
The reporting and functional currency of iPower and
subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar (USD). iPower’s WFOE and VIE in China uses the local currency, Renminbi (“RMB”), as
its functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the VIE are translated at the current exchange rate as quoted by the People’s
Bank of China (the “PBOC”) at the end of the period. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average translation
rates and the equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses
that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in
the results of operations as incurred.
The balance sheet amounts of the VIE, with the exception
of equity, on December 31, 2022, were translated at
6.8979
RMB to $1.00. The equity accounts were stated at their historical rates. The
average translation rates applied to statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) accounts for the six months ended December
31, 2022 was
6.978613
RMB to $1.00. Cash flows were also translated at average translation rates for the period and, therefore, amounts
reported on the statement of cash flows would not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held
as cash on hand and bank deposits.
From time to time, the Company may maintain bank
balances in interest bearing accounts in excess of the $250,000,
which is currently the maximum amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for interest bearing accounts (there is
currently no insurance limit for deposits in noninterest bearing accounts). To date, the Company has not experienced any losses with
respect to cash. Management believes the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to its cash.
Accounts receivable, net
During the ordinary course of business, the Company
extends unsecured credit to its customers. Accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect from customers.
Management reviews its accounts receivable balances each reporting period to determine if an allowance for credit loss is required.
In July 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Topics
326 - Credit Loss, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected
loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology, for its accounting standard for its trade
accounts receivable.
The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of all
of its customers individually before accepting them and continuously monitors the recoverability of accounts receivable. If there are
any indicators that a customer may not make payment, the Company may consider making provision for non-collectability for that particular
customer. At the same time, the Company may cease further sales or services to such customer. The following are some of the factors that
the Company develops allowance for credit losses:
·
the customer fails to comply with its payment schedule;
·
the customer is in serious financial difficulty;
·
a significant dispute with the customer has occurred regarding job progress or other matters;
·
the customer breaches any of its contractual obligations;
·
the customer appears to be financially distressed due to economic or legal factors;
·
the business between the customer and the Company is not active; and
·
other objective evidence indicates non-collectability of the accounts receivable.
9
The adoption of the credit loss accounting standard
has no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at carrying
amount less an allowance for credit losses, if any. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses resulting from the inability
of its customers to make required payments based on contractual terms. The Company reviews the collectability of its receivables on a
regular and ongoing basis. The Company has also included in calculation of allowance for credit losses the potential impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our customers’ businesses and their ability to pay their accounts receivable. After all attempts to collect a receivable
have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. The Company also considers external factors to the specific customer,
including current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions, including the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event
we recover amounts previously written off, we will reduce the specific allowance for credit losses.
Equity method investment
The Company accounts for its ownership interest
in Box Harmony, a
40 %
owned joint venture, following the equity method of accounting, in accordance with ASC 323, Investments — Equity Method and
Joint Ventures. Under this method, the carrying cost is initially recorded at cost and then increased or decreased by recording its
percentage of gain or loss in Box Harmony’s statement of operations and a corresponding charge or credit to the carrying value
of the asset.
Business Combination
On February 15, 2022, the Company acquired
100 % of
the ordinary shares of Anivia Limited (“Anivia”) and its subsidiaries, including its variable interest entity (“VIE”),
Daheshou (Shenzhen) Information Technology Co., Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“DHS”).
The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity
in a business combination recognizes 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management
utilizes valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. Any excess of the
purchase price paid over amounts allocated to assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded
as goodwill. Where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase
gain is recognized. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. See Note 4 for details on acquisition.
Variable interest entities
On February 15, 2022, the
Company acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Anivia Limited (“Anivia”) and its subsidiaries, including DHS. Pursuant to
the terms of the Agreements for the Company’s acquisition of Anivia and its subsidiaries, including DHS, the Company does not have
direct ownership in DHS but is actively involved in DHS’s operations as the sole manager to direct the activities and significantly
impact DHS’s economic performance. DHS’s operational funding has been provided by the Company following the February 15, 2022
acquisition. During the term of the Agreements, the Company bears all the risk of loss and has the right to receive all of the benefits
from DHS. As such, based on the determination that the Company is the primary beneficiary of DHS, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A
through 25-38J, DHS is considered a VIE of the Company and the financial statements of DHS have been consolidated from the date such control
existed, February 15, 2022. See Note 4 and Note 5 for details on acquisition.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill under
ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill
and Other .
10
Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential
impairment on an annual basis, or if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. The Company’s
review for impairment includes an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed,
which compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amounts, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting
unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting
unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit. The Company engaged an independent third-party valuation firm in August 2022 to conduct an evaluation
of goodwill impairment for the Company as a whole at the consolidated reporting unit level as of June 30, 2022, which evaluation was conducted
prior to the Company’s filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the decrease in the Company’s share price subsequent
to the filing of the Form 10-K and the net loss incurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company engaged the same valuation
firm to review goodwill for impairment. Based on this review, the Company concluded an impairment loss of $ 3,060,034
as of September
30, 2022 was required. The impairment amount was determined based on the discounted cash flows with the revised projections reflecting
the increase in freight and storage costs in the current interim quarter. The Company also considered the Market Capital Method, which
is an alternative market approach, suggested the Company’s goodwill is partially impaired.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment analysis following the steps laid out in ASC 350-20-35-3C and
noted no goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining goodwill balance amounted to $ 3,034,110 .
Intangible Assets, net
Finite life intangible assets at December 31, 2022
included a covenant not to compete, supplier relationships, and software recognized as part of the acquisition of Anivia Limited. Intangible
assets are recorded at the estimated fair value of these items at the date of acquisition, February 15, 2022. Intangible assets are amortized
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as followings:
Schedule of estimated useful life
Useful Life
Covenant Not to Compete
10
years
Supplier relationships
6
years
Software
5
years
The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived
assets, including intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not
be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment on asset group level is based on the ability to recover the carrying value of the
asset from the expected future pretax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash
flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value
and carrying value. The measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related to long-lived assets,
as well as other fair value determinations. As of December 31, 2022, there were no indicators of impairment.
Fair values of financial instruments
ASC 825, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments,” requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments. ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements”
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and all other current assets and liabilities approximate fair values due to their short-term nature.
11
On February 15, 2022, as part of the consideration
for the acquisition of Anivia Limited, the Company issued a two-year unsecured 6% subordinated promissory note, payable in equal semi-annual
installments commencing August 15, 2022 (the “Purchase Note”). The principal amount of the Purchase Note was $ 3.5
million .
On February 15, 2022, the Company evaluated the fair value of the Purchase Note to be $ 3.6
million
using the following inputs:
Schedule of assumptions
Corporate bond yield
3.1 %
Risk-free rate
1.6 %
Liquidity premium
0.4 %
Discount rate
3.5 %
As of December 31, 2022,
the outstanding balance of the Purchase Note was $ 2,858,947 , including a premium of $ 56,759
and $ 177,188
of accrued interest.
For other financial instruments to be reported at
fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions
in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized
in one of the following levels:
Level 1 – Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
Level 2 – Inputs are observable, unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially
the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are significant
to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.
The Company does not have any assets or liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain non-financial assets on a non-recurring basis, including goodwill. As
a result of those measurements, we recognized an impairment charge of $0 and $3.1 million during the three and six months ended December
31, 2022, as follows:
Schedule of fair value on nonrecurring basis

Goodwill, with a total carrying value of $6.1 million
was written down to its fair value of $3.0 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $3,060,034, which was recorded in earnings for
the six months ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of goodwill was determined based on the discounted cash flow method, which is an
income approach, which required the use of inputs that were unobservable in the marketplace (Level 3), including a discount rate that
would be used by a market participant, projections of revenues and cash flows with the revised projections reflecting the increase in
freight and storage costs in the current interim quarter, among others.

Revenue recognition
The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 606 since its inception on April 11, 2018 and recognizes revenue from product sales revenues, net of promotional discounts
and return allowances, when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: a contract has been identified, separate performance obligations
are identified, the transaction price is determined, the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations and revenue
is recognized upon satisfying each performance obligation. The Company transfers the risk of loss or damage upon shipment, therefore,
revenue from product sales is recognized when it is shipped to the customer. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by the Company’s
best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience.
The Company evaluates the criteria of ASC 606 -
Revenue Recognition Principal Agent Considerations in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales
and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise
to provide a specified good or service, the Company is subject to inventory risk before the good or service has been transferred to a
customer and the Company has discretion in establishing the price, revenue is recorded at gross.
Payments received prior to the delivery of goods to customers are recorded
as customer deposits.
The Company periodically provides incentive offers
to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases
and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by the Company’s customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase
price of the related transaction.
Sales discounts are recorded in the period in which
the related sale is recognized. Sales return allowances are estimated based on historical amounts and are recorded upon recognizing the
related sales. Shipping and handling costs are recorded as selling expenses.
Advertising costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total
advertising and promotional costs included in selling and fulfillment expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021 were as following.
Schedule of advertising costs
Three Months Ended December 31,
Six Months Ended December 31,

$ 578,565
$ 2,472,461
$ 1,211,981
Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue mainly consists of costs for purchases
of products and related inbound freight and delivery fees.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses, which consist of selling and fulfillment and general
and administrative expenses, are expensed as incurred.
13
Inventory
Inventory consists of finished goods ready for
sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company values its inventory using the weighted average costing method. The Company’s
policy is to include as a part of inventory and costs of goods sold any freight incurred to ship the product from its vendors to warehouses.
Outbound freight costs related to shipping costs to customers are considered periodic costs and are reflected in selling and fulfillment
expenses. The Company regularly reviews inventory and considers forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence.
If the estimated realizable value of the inventory
is less than cost, the Company makes provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated market value. The Company also
reviews inventory for slow moving inventory and obsolescence and records allowance for obsolescence.
Debt Issuance Costs
Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of
debt are deferred and amortized as interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. To the extent
that the debt is outstanding, these amounts are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as direct deductions from the carrying amount
of the outstanding borrowings.
Segment reporting
The Company follows ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The
Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews the consolidated results of operations when making
decisions about allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Company as a whole and, hence, the Company has only one reportable
segment. The Company does not distinguish between markets or segments for the purpose of internal reporting. For the six months ended
December 31, 2022, sales through Amazon to Canada and other foreign countries were approximately
13.5 % of the Company’s total sales.
Sales of hydroponic products, including ventilation and grow light systems, were approximately
47 % of the Company’s total sales
and the remaining
53 % consisted of general gardening, home goods and other products and accessories. As of December 31, 2022, there were
approximately $ 3.0
million
of inventory stored in China. The Company’s majority of long-lived assets are located in California,
United States, and majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from within the United States. Therefore, no geographical segments
are presented.
Leases
On its inception date, April 11, 2018, the Company
adopted ASC 842 – Leases (“ASC 842”), which requires lessees to record right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and related
lease obligations on the balance sheet, as well as disclose key information regarding leasing arrangements.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying
asset for the lease terms and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease
ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the
Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated
rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU
asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
14
Stock-based Compensation
The Company applies ASC No. 718, “Compensation-Stock
Compensation,” which requires that share-based payment transactions with employees and nonemployees upon adoption of ASU 2018-07,
be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument and recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service
period, with a corresponding addition to equity. Under this method, compensation cost related to employee share options or similar equity
instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the period during which an employee
is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. In addition to requisite service period,
the Company also evaluates the performance condition and market condition under ASC 718-10-20. For an award which contains both a performance
and a market condition, and where both conditions must be satisfied for the award to vest, the market condition is incorporated into the
fair value of the award, and that fair value is recognized over the employee’s requisite service period or nonemployee’s vesting
period if it is probable the performance condition will be met. If the performance condition is ultimately not met, compensation cost
related to the award should not be recognized (or should be reversed) because the vesting condition in the award has not been satisfied.
The Company will recognize forfeitures of such equity-based
compensation as they occur.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the
asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their perspective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that management determines
that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Valuation allowances are recorded, when necessary,
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
As a result of the implementation of certain provisions
of ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax position, as defined,
ASC 740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting
for income taxes. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 740 since inception, April 11, 2018, and has analyzed filing positions
in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where the Company is required to file income tax returns, as well as open tax years in
such jurisdictions. The Company has identified the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the states of Nevada and California, as its “major”
tax jurisdictions. However, the Company has certain tax attribute carryforwards which will remain subject to review and adjustment by
the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized.
The Company believes that our income tax filing positions
and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial
position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740. The Company’s policy
for recording interest and penalties associated with income-based tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes.
Commitments and contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is
subject to certain contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of the business that relate to a wide range of matters,
such as government investigations and tax matters. The Company recognizes a liability for such contingency if it determines it is probable
that a loss has occurred and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made. The Company may consider many factors in making these assessments
including historical and specific facts and circumstances of each matter.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing
net income attributable to holders of common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities to issue common stock were exercised.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In June 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value
Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The amendments in this
ASU clarify the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction
and require specific disclosures related to such an equity security. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business
Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU clarifies
that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance
with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) as if the entity had originated the contracts. The guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early application permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption
of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and ASU No.
2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, respectively (collectively, “Topic 848”). Topic 848 provides optional expedients
and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and
exceptions provided by Topic 848 are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect
the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt
– Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
(Subtopic 815-40).” This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred
stock, as well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based
accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for the Company
on July 1, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective
method of transition. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments
- Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) -
Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815.” This ASU among other things clarifies that a company should
consider observable transactions that require a company to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting under Topic 323,
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in accordance with Topic
321 immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. The new ASU clarifies that, when determining the accounting for
certain forward contracts and purchased options a company should not consider, whether upon settlement or exercise, if the underlying
securities would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option. ASU 2020-01 is effective for public business entities
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2021. An entity should apply ASU 2020-01
prospectively at the beginning of the interim period that includes the adoption date. The adoption of ASU 2020-01 did not have material
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
16
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income
Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The update is intended to simplify the current rules regarding
the accounting for income taxes and addresses several technical topics including accounting for franchise taxes, allocating income taxes
between a loss in continuing operations and in other categories such as discontinued operations, reporting income taxes for legal entities
that are not subject to income taxes, and interim accounting for enacted changes in tax laws. The new standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022; however, early adoption
is permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles
- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which eliminates step two from the goodwill
impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 became effective for
accelerated filing companies for annual periods or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2019. All other entities, including not-for-profit entities, that are adopting the amendments in this Update should do so for their
annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early
adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after  January 1, 2017. The
Company has adopted ASU 2017-04. See disclosures above on Goodwill for further details.
The Company does not believe other recently issued
but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position,
statements of operations and cash flows.
Subsequent events
The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions
that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. Material
subsequent events that required recognition or additional disclosure in the consolidated financial statements are presented.
Note 3 -
Joint Ventures
Box Harmony, LLC
On January 13, 2022, the Company entered into a joint
venture agreement (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) with Titanium Plus Autoparts, Inc., a California corporation (“TPA”),
Tony Chiu (“Chiu”) and Bin Xiao (“Xiao”). Pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, the parties formed
a Nevada limited liability company, Box Harmony, LLC (“Box Harmony”), for the principal purpose of providing logistic services
primarily for foreign-based manufacturers or distributors who desire to sell their products online in the United States, with such logistic
services to include, without limitation, receiving, storing and transporting such products.
Following entry into the
Joint Venture Agreement, Box Harmony issued a total of 6,000 certificated units of membership interest, designated as Class A voting units

Income taxes
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022,
as a result of the Company’s inability to establish a reliable estimate for annual effective tax rate, the Company calculated income
tax expense using the actual effective tax rate year to date, as opposed to the estimated annual effective tax rate, as provided in Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 740-270-30-18.

Due to the ani-dilutive effect, the computation
of basic and diluted EPS did not include the shares underlying the exercise of warrants as the Company had a net loss for the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022.
*
The computation of diluted EPS did not include the underlying shares of warrants calculated using treasury method for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 as the exercise price was greater than the market price of the shares.
*
For the three and six months ended December 31,
2022,
154,261
vested but unissued shares of restricted stock units under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (as discussed in Note 16) are
considered issued shares and therefore are included in the computation of basic earnings (losses) per share when the shares are fully
vested.
*
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021,   10,886
vested but unissued shares of restricted stock units under the Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan are considered issued shares and therefore are included in the computation of basic earnings (losses) per share as of grant date when the shares are fully vested. Impact of nonvested RSU is immaterial to the EPS.
Note 16 –
Equity
Common Stock
During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company issued
40,019
shares of restricted common stock for RSUs vested in the quarter ended September 30, 2021.
On February 15, 2022, as part of the consideration
for the acquisition of Anivia and subsidiaries, the Company issued
3,083,700
restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, valued
at $ 2.27
per share, which was the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock as traded on Nasdaq on February 15, 2022. These shares
have a lock-up period of 180 days and are subject to insider trading restrictions. The fair value of the shares was $ 5,528,373 , calculated
with a discount of lack of marketability of 21%, which is determined using the Black Scholes Model.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there were
29,572,382
and
29,572,382
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, respectively.
Preferred Stock
The Company’s Preferred Stock was authorized
as “blank check” series of Preferred Stock, providing that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized, subject to limitations
prescribed by law, by resolution or resolutions and by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of the State of Nevada, to
provide, out of the authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, for series of Preferred Stock, and to establish from time to time
the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each
such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, there
were no shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.
Equity Incentive Plan
On May 5, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors
adopted, and its stockholders approved and ratified, the iPower Inc. Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”).
The Plan allows for the issuance of up to
5,000,000
shares of Common Stock, whether in the form of options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units, performance shares and other stock or cash awards. The general purpose of the
Plan is to provide an incentive to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors by enabling them to share
in the future growth of the Company’s business. On November 16, 2021, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 registering
all shares issuable under the Plan.
28
Restricted Stock Unit
Following completion of the IPO on May 11, 2021, pursuant
to their letter agreements, the Company awarded a total of
46,546
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the Plan to its independent
directors, Chief Financial Officer, and certain other employees and consultants, all of which are subject to certain vesting conditions
in the next 12 months and restrictions until filing of a Form S-8 for registration of the shares. On November 16, 2021, we filed a registration
statement on Form S-8 registering all shares issuable under the Plan. The fair value of the RSUs was determined to be based on $5.00 per
share, the initial listing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of RSUs issued subsequent to IPO
date was based on the stock price on each grant date. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted an additional
79,406
shares of RSUs. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 21,884
and $ 49,384
of stock-based compensation
expense. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $ 54,435
and $ 157,489
of stock-based compensation expense.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the unvested number of RSUs was
24,800
and
6,608
and the unamortized expense was $ 14,384
and
$ 15,000 , respectively.

shares were to be issued upon setup of the plan administration account.
Stock Option
On May 12, 2022, the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors approved an incentive plan for the Company’s executive officers consisting of a cash performance bonus
of $ 60,000
to be
awarded to Kevin Vassily, CFO of the Company, and stock option grants (the “Option Grants”) in the amount of (i)
3,000,000
shares to Chenlong Tan, CEO and (ii)
330,000
shares to Mr. Vassily. The Option Grants, which were issued on May 13, 2022, have an exercise price of $ 1.12
per share , a contractual term of 10 years and consist of six vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the
attainment of both designated operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions (together, the “Designated
Milestones”), assuming continued employment of the recipients through the date on
which such Designated Milestones are achieved. Each of the six vesting tranches for the Option Grants will vest when both (i) the
market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $150 million for the first tranche and increases by
increments of $50 million through the fourth tranche and $100 million thereafter (based on achieving such market capitalization
for five consecutive trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following six operational milestones focused on
revenue or any one of the six operational milestones focused on operating income have been achieved during a given fiscal year.
29
The achievement status of the operational milestones
as of December 31, 2022 was as follows:

The Company evaluated the performance condition and
market condition under ASC 718-10-20. The Option Grants are considered an award containing a performance and a market condition and both
conditions (in this case at least one of the performance conditions) must be satisfied for the award to vest. The market condition is
incorporated into the fair value of the award, and that fair value is recognized over the longer of the implied service period or requisite
service period if it is probable that one of the performance conditions will be met. In relation to the five awards deemed probable to
vest, the recognition period ranges from 2.93 years to 9.64 years. If the performance condition is ultimately not met, compensation cost
related to the award should not be recognized (or should be reversed to the extent any expense has been recognized related to such tranche)
because the vesting condition in the award would not have been satisfied.
On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used
to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time when the market capitalization milestone
for such tranche was expected to be achieved. Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance, each quarter
we determine whether it is probable that we will achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or deemed probable
of achievement and if so, the future time when we expect to achieve that operational milestone. The Monte Carlo simulation utilized the
following inputs:
·
Stock Price - $ 1.12
·
Volatility –
95.65 %
·
Term – 10
years
·
Risk Free Rate of Return –
2.93 %
·
Dividend Yield –
0 %
The total fair value of the Option Grants was $3.2
million of which, at June 30, 2022, $2.3 million is deemed probable of vesting. As of December 31, 2022,
none
of the options had vested.
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 110,382
and $ 220,764
of stock-based compensation expense related
to the Option Grants. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company did
no t record any stock-based compensation expense
related to the Option Grants. Unrecognized compensation cost related to tranches probable of vesting is approximately $2.0 million and
will be recognized over 2.5 years to 9.5 years, depending on the tranche.
Note 17 –
Warrant liabilities
The Company’s warrant liabilities contained
unobservable inputs that reflected the Company’s own assumptions in which there was little, if any, market activity as of the measurement
date. Accordingly, the Company’s warrant liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs
and were classified as Level 3 measurements.
30
On December 30, 2020, the Company issued warrants
to purchase
2,415
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to Boustead Securities, LLC (the “Placement Agent”) as compensation,
which was recorded as financing expense. The exercise price of the warrants is $ 10
per share and expires in five years from the issuance
date. This Series A Preferred Stock warrant was valued using Black Scholes Option Pricing Model at issuance date and recorded $ 8,047
as financing expense and warrant liability.
On January 27, 2021, the Company completed a private
placement offering pursuant to which the Company sold to two accredited investors an aggregate of $ 3,000,000
in Convertible Notes and
warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock equaling 80% of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of the Convertible Notes. The convertible note warrants shall be exercisable for a period of three years from the IPO completion date
at a per share exercise price equal to the IPO. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, in the event the Convertible Notes are repaid
in cash by the Company, the warrants issued in conjunction with the Convertible Notes will expire and have no further value.
In connection with the Convertible Note offering,
the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 7.0% of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Convertible Notes exercisable
at the conversion price of the Convertible Note (the “Conversion Price”). The placement agent warrants had an exercise period
of five years from the issuance date.
On May 14, 2021, upon closing of its IPO, the Company
remeasured the warrants to fair value using the Modified Black Scholes Option Pricing Model, based on the expected fair value of the underlying
stock with the following assumptions:
Schedule of assumptions for warrant liabilities
As of May 14, 2021

Expected volatility
3.3% to 58%
Risk-free interest rate
0.35% to 0.92%
Expected dividend rate

Probability

As of May 14, 2021, the fair value of the warrant
liabilities was $ 1,361,347 , which includes $ 4,610
preferred stock warrant, $ 1,324,668
warrants issued to the Convertible Note investors
and $ 32,069
warrants issued to the placement agent. The increase in fair value immediately before the IPO was $ 617,593 , which was reported
in other non-operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Upon closing the IPO on May 14, 2021, the Placement
Agent exercised its warrants in full to purchase a total of
24,451
shares of the Company’s Common Stock and, as such, there were
no placement agent warrants outstanding as of June 30, 2021. At the same time, the outstanding warrants held by the Convertible Note investors
were reclassed to additional paid in capital as the terms became fixed upon closing of the IPO. Through December 31, 2022, none of the
private placement investors exercised any of their warrants. As such, as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the number of shares
issuable under the outstanding warrants was
685,715 , with an average exercise price of $ 5.00
per share.
Note 18 -
Concentration of risk
Credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
31
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, $ 3,997,125
and $ 1,821,947 , respectively, were deposited with various major financial institutions in the United States and PRC. Accounts at each
institution in the United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000. The Company had approximately
$ 3.1
million
and $ 0.5
million , respectively, in excess of the FDIC insurance limit, as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived
from revenue earned from customers, thereby exposing the Company to credit risk. The risk is mitigated by the Company’s assessment
of its customers’ creditworthiness and its ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances. The Company maintains reserves for estimated
credit losses, and such losses have generally been within expectations.
The business of DHS, the Company’s VIE, may
be impacted by Chinese economic conditions, changes in regulations and laws, and other uncertainties.
Customer and vendor concentration risk
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
Amazon Vendor and Amazon Seller customers accounted for
91 % and
89 % of the Company's total revenues, respectively. As of December 31,
2022 and June 30, 2022, accounts receivable from Amazon Vendor and Amazon Seller accounted for
89 % and
94 % of the Company’s total
accounts receivable.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
two suppliers accounted for
41 % ( 31 % and
10 %) and
29 % ( 22 % and
7 %) of the Company's total purchases, respectively. As of December 31,
2022, accounts payable to two suppliers accounted for
65 % ( 57 % and
8 %) of the Company’s total accounts payable. As of June 30, 2022,
accounts payable to two suppliers accounted for
44 % ( 34 % and
10 %) of the Company’s total accounts payable.
Note 19 -
Commitments and contingencies
Lease commitments
The Company has adopted ASC842 since its inception
date, April 11, 2018. The Company has entered into a lease agreement to rent office and warehouse space with a lease period from December
1, 2018 until December 31, 2020. On August 24, 2020, the Company negotiated for new terms to extend the lease through December 21, 2023
at the rate of approximately $42,000 per month.
On September 1, 2020, in addition to the primary fulfillment
center, the Company leased a second fulfillment center in City of Industry, California. The base rental fee ranges from $27,921 to $29,910

On February 15, 2022, upon completion of the acquisition
of Anivia Limited, the Company assumed an operating lease for offices located in the People’s Republic of China.
On July 28, 2021, the Company entered into a Lease
agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) with 9th & Vineyard, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Landlord”),

Agreement as completion of the construction was not timely completed. On February 23, 2022, as a result of the delay in completion of
the construction, the Company entered into an amended agreement to extend the lease term to 74 months. The lease commencement date is
February 10, 2022, with rent payments commencing May 11, 2022 and the lease expiring on May 31, 2028. The base rental fee ranges from

Pursuant to an engagement agreement, dated and effective
August 31, 2020 (the “Engagement Agreement”), with Boustead Securities LLC (“Boustead”), the Company engaged Boustead
to act as its exclusive placement agent for private placements of its securities and as a potential underwriter for its initial public
offering. On February 28, 2021, the Company informed Boustead that it was terminating the Engagement Agreement and any continuing obligations
the Company may have had under its terms. On April 15, 2021, the Company provided formal written notice to Boustead of its termination
of the Engagement Agreement and all obligations thereunder, effective immediately. On April 30, 2021, Boustead filed a statement of claim
with the Financial Institute Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, demanding to arbitrate the dispute, and is seeking, among other things, monetary
damages against the Company and D.A. Davidson & Co. (who acted as underwriter in the Company’s IPO). Presently, the matter is
scheduled to be heard before a FINRA arbitration appeal over six non-consecutive days during the months of April and May 2023. The Company
has agreed to indemnify D.A. Davidson & Co. and the other underwriters against any liability or expense they may incur or be subject
to arising out of the Boustead dispute. Additionally, Chenlong Tan, the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
and a beneficial owner more than 5% of the Company’s Common Stock, has agreed to reimburse the Company for any judgments, fines
and amounts paid or actually incurred by the Company or an indemnitee in connection with such legal action or in connection with any settlement
agreement entered into by the Company or an indemnitee up to a maximum of $3.5 million in the aggregate, with the sole source of funding
of such reimbursement to come from sales of shares then owned by Mr. Tan. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of potential
exposure as of the date of this report.
In an effort to contain or slow the COVID-19 outbreak,
authorities across the world have implemented various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded or modified, including
travel bans, stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of certain businesses. The Company anticipates that these actions and the global health
crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, including any resurgences, will continue to negatively impact global economic activity. While
the COVID-19 outbreak has not had a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations to date, it is difficult to predict all
of the positive or negative impacts the COVID-19 outbreak may have on the Company’s business in the future.
34
In
February 2022, the Russian Federation began conducting military operations against Ukraine, which have been ongoing ever since,
resulting in global economic uncertainty and increased cost of various commodities. In response to these types of events, should
they directly impact our supply chain or other operations, we may experience or be exposed to supply chain disruption which could
cause us to seek alternate sources for product supply, or suffer consequences that are unexpected and difficult to mitigate. Any of
these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.
Although, it is difficult to predict the impact that these factors may have on our business in the future, they did not have a
material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the three and six months ended December 31,
2022.
Note 20 -
Subsequent events
The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions
that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. Other
than as disclosed in Note 12 above, no material subsequent events that required recognition or additional disclosure in the consolidated
financial statements presented herein.

Overview
iPower Inc. is a U.S.-based
online retailer and supplier of consumer home, garden and pet products. Through the operations of our e-commerce platform, www.simpledeluxe.com
and www.Zenhydro.com, our combined 121,000 square foot fulfillment centers in Los Angeles, California, as well as our 99,000 square foot
fulfillment center in Rancho Cucamonga, California, we believe we are one of the leading marketers, distributors and retailers of home
fans, shelving, gaming chairs, grow-light systems, ventilation systems, activated carbon filters, nutrients, hydroponic water-resistant
grow tents, trimming machines, pumps, accessories for hydroponic gardening and certain pet products, based on management’s estimates.
We have a diverse customer base that includes commercial users and individuals. Our core strategy continues to focus on expanding our
geographic reach across the United States through organic growth, both in terms of expanding customer base as well as brand and product
development.
We are actively developing
and acquiring our in-house branded products, which to date include the
iPower, Simple Deluxe
and other brands and consist
of products such as home goods, fans, pet products, grow-light systems, ventilation systems, activated carbon filters, nutrients, hydroponic
water-resistant grow tents, trimming machines, pumps and many more hydroponic-related items; some of which have been designated as Amazon
best seller product leaders, among others. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, our top five product segments accounted for 78%
of total sales. While we continue to focus on our top product categories, we are working to expand our product catalog to include new
and adjacent categories.
Trends and Expectations
Product and Brand Development
We plan to increase our investments
in product and brand development. We actively evaluate potential acquisition opportunities of companies and product brand names that can
complement our product catalog and improve on existing products and supply chain efficiencies.
36
Global Economic Disruption
While at present the majority
of our products are sourced either in the United States or Mainland China, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine may nonetheless
increase the likelihood of supply chain disruptions or otherwise hinder our ability to find the materials we need to make our products.
In addition, supply chain disruptions may make it harder for us to find favorable pricing and reliable sources for the materials we need,
putting upward pressure on our costs and increasing the risk that we may be unable to acquire the materials and services we need to continue
to make certain products.
Ongoing COVID-19 Epidemic and Related Disruptions
We are continuing to closely
monitor the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic on our business, results of operations and financial results. The situation surrounding
the COVID-19 epidemic remains fluid and the full extent of the positive or negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business will
depend on certain developments including the length of time that the epidemic continues, the impact on consumer activity and behaviors
and the effect on our customers, employees, suppliers and stockholders, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our focus
remains on promoting the health, safety and financial security of our employees and serving our customers. As a result, we have taken
a number of precautionary measures, including implementing social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures in our facilities, providing
emergency paid time off and targeted hourly pay increases as well as developing no contact delivery methods.
In an effort to contain or
slow the COVID-19 epidemic, authorities across the world have implemented various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded
or modified, including travel bans, stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of certain businesses. We anticipate that these actions and the
global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, including any resurgences, will continue to negatively impact global economic activity.
While the COVID-19 epidemic has not had a material adverse impact on our operations to date and we believe the long-term opportunity that
we see for shopping online remains unchanged, it is difficult to predict all of the positive or negative impacts the COVID-19 outbreak
will have on our business.
In the short term, we have
continued to see increased sales and order activity in the market since the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to keep up with the increased
orders, we have hired and are continuing to hire additional personnel. However, much is unknown and, accordingly, the situation remains
dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions
that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the
best interests of our customers, employees, suppliers, stockholders and communities.
Regulatory Environment
We sell hydroponic gardening
products to end users that may use such products in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis. The demand
for hydroponic gardening products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments due to varying, inconsistent and rapidly
changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations and consumer perceptions. For example,
certain countries and a total of 44 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate and tax
the cultivation, processing, sale and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, including legalization of hemp and CBD,
while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of certain U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis. Demand for our products could
be impacted by changes in the regulatory environment with respect to such industries and segments.

Revenues
Revenues for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 increased 12.43% to $19,254,590 as compared to $17,125,663 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. While
pricing remained stable, the increased revenue mainly resulted from an increase in sales volume and expansion of sales to other regions,
such as Canada, Europe and Asia. In addition to our organic growth and diversified product mix, which we achieved as a result of improved
products and more effective online marketing and merchandising efforts, the increase in sales was attributable to more people shopping
online and pursuing gardening and growing projects during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Costs of Goods Sold
Costs of goods sold for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 increased 17.95% to $11,285,064 as compared to $9,568,051 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was due to an increase in sales, which resulted in increased accompanying costs. See discussions on gross profit below. We
have seen decreasing freight charges since September 2022 but cannot be assured that this trend will continue.
38
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $7,969,526
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $7,557,612 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The gross profit
ratio decreased to 41.39% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 44.13% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
in the gross profit ratio was mainly driven by the increase in cost of goods sold as a result of increased freight charges as well as
channel and product category mix.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 87.66% to $12,052,092 as compared to $6,422,327 for the three months ended December 31,
2021. The increase was mainly due to the combination of an increase in selling and fulfillment expenses of $5.7 million as a result of
increased costs related to advertising, merchant fees, and delivery fees, and a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $0.07
million, which included payroll expenses, stock-based compensation expense, insurance expenses and other operating expenses including
expenses associated with being a publicly traded company.
(Loss) Income from Operations
(Loss) Income from operations
was ($4,082,566) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $1,135,285 for the three ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
in income was resulted from the increase in operating expenses being greater than the increase in gross profit received, as discussed
above.
Other Expenses
Other expenses for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 was $258,457 as compared to $14,709 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other
expenses was mainly due to an increase in interest, including amortization of debt discount on the revolving loan of $239,007 during the
period ended December 31, 2022.
Net (Loss) Income Attributable to iPower
Inc.
Net loss attributable to iPower
Inc. for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was ($3,290,439) as compared to net income of $797,861 for the three months ended December
31, 2021, representing a decrease of $4,088,300. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses as discussed above.
Comprehensive (Loss) Income Attributable
to iPower Inc.
Comprehensive loss attributable
to iPower Inc. for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was ($3,243,290) as compared to comprehensive income of $797,861 for the three
months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of $4,041,151. The decrease was due to the reasons discussed above, along with
the other comprehensive income of $47,149 as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the translation of RMB,
the functional currency of our VIE in PRC, to USD, the reporting currency of the Company.

remained stable, the increased revenue mainly resulted from an increase in sales volume and expansion of sales to other regions, such
as Canada, Europe and Asia. In addition to our organic growth and diversified product mix, which we achieved as a result of improved products
and more effective online marketing and merchandising efforts, the increase in sales was attributable to more people shopping online and

Costs of Goods Sold
Costs of goods sold for the
six months ended December 31, 2022 increased 39.25% to $27,322,021 as compared to $19,621,114 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was due to an increase in sales, as discussed above. In addition, we experienced an increase in costs of goods sold as a
percentage of revenue as a result of the increased freight charges during the six months ended December 31, 2022. However, the freight
costs have been decreasing since September 2022, causing the increase in costs of goods sold for the six months was more significant comparing
to the increase in the three months ended December 31, 2022. See discussions on gross profit below. We have seen decreasing freight charges
since September 2022 but could not be assured that this trend will continue.
40
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $17,955,242
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $14,871,314 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The gross profit ratio
slightly decreased to 39.66% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 43.11% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
in gross profit ratio was mainly driven by an increase in freight charges during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as well as channel
and product category mix.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the
six months ended December 31, 2022 increased 113.98% to $26,631,114 as compared to $12,445,714 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase was mainly due to the combination of an increase in selling and fulfillment expenses of $10.4 million as a result of increased
advertising, merchant fees, delivery fees, storage costs and fulfillment workforce, general and administrative expenses of $0.7 million,
which included payroll expenses, stock-based compensation expense, insurance expenses and other operating expenses including expenses
associated with being a publicly traded company, and $3.1 million of impairment loss on goodwill triggered by a decrease in the Company’s
share price of its common stock and the net loss incurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022.
(Loss) Income from Operations
(Loss) Income from operations was
($8,675,872) for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $2,425,600 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
was due to the increase in operating expenses was greater than the increase in gross profit as discussed above.
Other Expenses
Other expenses for the six
months ended December 31, 2022 was $298,128 as compared to $74,521 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other expenses
was mainly due to a combined result of an increase in other non-operating income of $261,770, and an increase in interest, including amortization
of debt discount on the revolving loan of $487,048 during the period ended December 31, 2022.
Net (Loss) Income Attributable to iPower
Inc.
Net loss attributable to iPower
Inc. for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was ($7,472,815) as compared to net income of $1,685,389 for the six months ended December
31, 2021, representing a decrease of $9,158,204. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses as discussed above.
Comprehensive (Loss) Income Attributable
to iPower Inc.
Comprehensive loss
attributable to iPower Inc. for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was ($7,537,141) as compared to comprehensive income of
$1,685,389 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of $9,222,530. The decrease was due to the reasons
discussed above, along with other comprehensive loss of $64,326 as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting
from the translation of RMB, the functional currency of our VIE in PRC, to USD, the reporting currency of the Company.
41
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Sources of Liquidity
During the six months ended
December 31, 2022 we primarily funded our operations with cash and cash equivalents generated from operations, as well as through the
completion of two private placements in 2020 and 2021, completion of our initial public offering in May of 2021, and borrowing under our
credit facility and loans from the Small Business Administration and JPMorgan Chase Bank ("JPM”). We had cash and cash equivalents
of $3,997,125 as of December 31, 2022, representing a $2.2 million increase from $1,821,947 of cash as of June 30, 2022. The cash increase
was primarily the result of the increase in net cash provided by operating activities.
Based on our current operating
plan, and despite the current uncertainty resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents
and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations during the next 12 months.
Our cash requirements consist
primarily of day-to-day operating expenses and obligations with respect to warehouse leases. We lease all our office and warehouse facilities.
We expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations. We have credit terms in place with our major
suppliers, however, as we bring on new suppliers, we are often required to prepay our inventory purchases from them. This is consistent
with our historical operating model which allowed us to operate using only cash generated by the business. Beyond the next 12 months we
believe that our cash flows from operations should improve as supply chains begin to return to normal and new suppliers that we bring online
transition to credit terms more favorable to us. In addition, we plan to increase the size of our in-house product catalog, which will
have a net beneficial impact to our margin profile and ability to generate cash. In addition, we have approximately $9.0 million in unused
credit under our revolving line of credit with JPM as of December 31, 2022. Given our current working capital position and available funding
from our revolving credit line, we believe we will be able to manage through the current challenges by managing payment terms with our
customers and vendors.
Working Capital
As of December 31, 2022 and June
30, 2022, our working capital was $22.96 million and $32.3 million, respectively. The historical seasonality in our business during the
year can cause cash and cash equivalents, inventory and accounts payable to fluctuate, resulting in changes in our working capital. We
anticipate that past historical trends will remain in place through the balance of the fiscal year with working capital remaining near
this level for the foreseeable future.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by (used in)
operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $7,778,208 and ($12,243,043), respectively.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities mainly resulted from decreased accounts receivable, inventories, prepayments and
other current assets and increased accounts payable.
Investing Activities
For the six months ended
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $127,367 and $56,424, respectively. The increase
in cash used in investing activities was because the Company made additional purchase of equipment during the six months ended
December 31, 2022.
Financing Activities
Net cash (used in) provided by
financing activities was ($5,540,436) and $6,739,520, respectively, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
The main reason the Company experienced a decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to our payment of $8.6
million for: 1) $1.5 million to pay off investment payable; 2) $0.88 million to pay down note payable; and 3) $6.2 million to pay down
the outstanding balance of the asset-based revolving loan facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank.
42
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material
effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP and pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably
likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there
are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition and results of operations will be affected.
We base our estimates on experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these
estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies, which we discuss further
below. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe
that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of
our audited consolidated financial statements.
Revenue reco g nition
The Company recognizes revenue
from product sales revenues, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, when the following revenue recognition criteria are met:
a contract has been identified, separate performance obligations are identified, the transaction price is determined, the transaction
price is allocated to separate performance obligations and revenue is recognized upon satisfying each performance obligation. The Company
transfers the risk of loss or damage upon shipment, therefore, revenue from product sales is recognized when it is shipped to the customer.
Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by the Company’s best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using
historical experience.
The Company evaluates the criteria
of ASC 606 - Revenue Recognition Principal Agent Considerations in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of
product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling
the promise to provide a specified good or service, the Company is subject to inventory risk before the good or service has been transferred
to a customer and the Company has discretion in establishing the price, revenue is recorded at gross.
Payments received prior to
the shipment of goods to customers are recorded as customer deposits.
The Company periodically provides
incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off
current purchases and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by the Company’s customers, are treated as a
reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction.
Sales discounts are recorded
in the period in which the related sale is recognized. Sales return allowances are estimated based on historical amounts and are recorded
upon recognizing the related sales. Shipping and handling costs are recorded as selling expenses.
Inventory, net
Inventory consists of finished
goods ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company values its inventory using the weighted average costing
method. The Company’s policy is to include as a part of inventory and costs of goods sold any freight incurred to ship the product
from its vendors to warehouses. Outbound freight costs related to shipping costs to customers are considered period costs and reflected
in selling, fulfillment, general and administrative expenses. The Company regularly reviews inventory and considers forecasts of future
demand, market conditions and product obsolescence.
If the estimated realizable
value of the inventory is less than cost, the Company makes provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated market value.
The Company also reviews inventory for slow moving and obsolescence and records allowance for obsolescence.

Business Combination
On
February 15, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Anivia Limited (“Anivia”) and its subsidiaries, including
its variable interest entity (“VIE”), Daheshou (Shenzhen) Information Technology Co., Ltd., a company organized under the
laws of the People’s Republic of China (“DHS”). The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business
combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes 100% of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management utilizes valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability
being measured in determining these fair values. Any excess of the purchase price paid over amounts allocated to assets acquired, including
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
See Note 4 for details on acquisition.
Variable interest entities
On
February 15, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Anivia Limited (“Anivia”) and its subsidiaries, including
DHS. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, the Company does not have direct ownership in DHS but is actively involved in DHS’s
operations as the sole manager to direct the activities and significantly impact DHS’s economic performance. DHS’s operational
funding has been provided by the Company following the February 15, 2022 acquisition. During the term of the Agreements, the Company bears
all the risk of loss and has the right to receive all of the benefits from DHS. As such, based on the determination that the Company is
the primary beneficiary of DHS, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J, DHS is considered a VIE of the Company and the financial
statements of DHS have been consolidated from the date such control existed, February 15, 2022. See Note 4 and Note 5 for details on acquisition.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill under
ASC Topic
350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other .
Goodwill is not amortized
but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting
unit level. The Company’s review for impairment includes an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If it is determined that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill, a quantitative goodwill impairment
test is performed, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amounts, including goodwill. If the fair value
of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. However, if the carrying
amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an
impairment loss
shall be recognized
in an amount equal
to that
excess, limited to
the
total
amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit The Company engaged an independent third-party
valuation firm in August 2022 to conduct an evaluation of goodwill impairment for the Company as a whole at the consolidated reporting
unit level as of June 30, 2022, which evaluation was conducted prior to the Company’s filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Due to the decrease in the Company’s share price subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K and the net loss incurred during the
quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company engaged the same valuation firm to review goodwill for impairment. Based on this review, the Company concluded an impairment loss of $3,060,034 as of September 30, 2022 was required. The impairment amount was determined based
on the discounted cash flows with the revised projections reflecting the increase in freight and storage costs in the current interim
quarter. The Company also considered the Market Capital Method, which is an alternative market approach, suggested the Company’s
goodwill is partially impaired.
During the three months ended
December 31, 2022, the Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment analysis following the steps laid out in ASC 350-20-35-3C
and noted no goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining goodwill balance amounted to $3,034,110.
44
Intangible Assets, net
Finite
life intangible assets at June 30, 2022 include a covenant not to compete, supplier relationship, and software recognized as part of the
acquisition of Anivia Limited. Intangible assets are recorded at the estimated fair value of these items at the date of acquisition, February
15, 2022. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as followings:
Useful Life
Covenant Not to Compete
10 years
Supplier relationships
6 years
Software
5 years
The Company reviews the recoverability
of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the
asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the carrying value of the asset
from the expected future pretax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying
value. The measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related to long-lived assets, as well as
other fair value determinations. As of December 31, 2022, there were no indicators of impairment.
Stock-based Compensation
The
Company applies ASC No. 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation,” which requires that share-based payment transactions with
employees and nonemployees upon adoption of ASU 2018-07, be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument and recognized
as compensation expense over the requisite service period, with a corresponding addition to equity. Under this method, compensation cost
related to employee share options or similar equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and
is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the
vesting period. In addition to the requisite service period, the Company also evaluates the performance condition and market condition
under ASC 718-10-20. For an award that contains both a performance and a market condition, and where both conditions must be satisfied
in order for the award to vest, the market condition is incorporated into the fair value of the award, and that fair value is recognized
over the employee’s requisite service period or nonemployee’s vesting period if it is probable that the performance condition
will be met. If the performance condition is ultimately not met, compensation cost related to the award should not be recognized (or should
be reversed) because the vesting condition in the award has not been satisfied.
The Company will recognize
forfeitures of such equity-based compensation as they occur.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income
taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their perspective tax bases. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that management
determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Valuation allowances are recorded, when
necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
45
As a result of the implementation
of certain provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty
in tax position, as defined, ASC 740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
measurement related to accounting for income taxes. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 740 since inception, April 11, 2018,
and has analyzed filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where the Company is required to file income tax returns,
as well as open tax years in such jurisdictions. The Company has identified the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the states of Nevada and
California, as its “major” tax jurisdictions. However, the Company has certain tax attribute carryforwards which will remain
subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which
such attributes are utilized.
The Company believes that
our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a
material change to its financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to ASC
740. The Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with income-based tax audits is to record such items as
a component of income taxes.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In June 2022, FASB issued ASU
2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 82): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions.
The amendments in this ASU clarify the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual
sale restriction and require specific disclosures related to such an equity security. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.
In October 2021, the FASB
issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with
Customers. This ASU clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in
a business combination in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) as if the entity had originated
the contracts. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early application permitted. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020 and January
2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting and ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, respectively (collectively, "Topic 848”).
Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that
reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference
rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by Topic 848 are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December
31, 2022. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued
ASU 2020-06, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts
in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).” This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments
and convertible preferred stock, as well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s
own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance.
This standard is effective for the Company on July 1, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption is either a
modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2020, the FASB
issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815.” This ASU among other
things clarifies that a company should consider observable transactions that require a company to either apply or discontinue the equity
method of accounting under Topic 323, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, for the purposes of applying the measurement
alternative in accordance with Topic 321 immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. The new ASU clarifies that,
when determining the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options a company should not consider, whether upon settlement
or exercise, if the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option. ASU 2020-01 is effective.
For public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2021. An entity
should apply ASU 2020-01 prospectively at the beginning of the interim period that includes the adoption date. The adoption of ASU 2020-01
did not have material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
46
In December 2019, the FASB
issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The update is intended to simplify the
current rules regarding the accounting for income taxes and addresses several technical topics including accounting for franchise taxes,
allocating income taxes between a loss in continuing operations and in other categories such as discontinued operations, reporting income
taxes for legal entities that are not subject to income taxes, and interim accounting for enacted changes in tax laws. The new standard
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021; however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard did
not have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB
issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which
eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount
by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
ASU 2017-04 became effective for accelerated filing companies for annual periods or any interim goodwill impairment tests in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities, including not-for-profit entities, that are adopting the amendments
in this Update should do so for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.
Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing
dates after  January 1, 2017.
The Company
has adopted ASU 2017-04. See disclosures
above on Goodwill for further details.
The Company does not believe
other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated
financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As a “smaller reporting
company,” we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of December 31, 2022, our
management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our management
concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective because, among other things, (i) we did not maintain
a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate degree of technical knowledge commensurate with the Company’s accounting
and reporting requirements and complex transactions, (ii) we lack effective communication procedures in our controlled subsidiaries, and
(iii) our controls related to the financial statements closing process were not adequately designed or appropriately implemented to identify
material misstatements in our financial reporting on a timely basis. Management has evaluated remediation plans to address these deficiencies
and is implementing changes to address the material weakness identified, including hiring additional accountants and consultants and implementing
controls and procedures over the financial reporting process.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
UHY LLP, our independent registered
public accounting firm, is not required to and has not provided an assessment over the design or effectiveness of our internal controls
over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Our former placement agent,
Boustead Securities LLC ("Boustead”), has brought a legal action against us following our communication to Boustead to unilaterally
terminate an engagement agreement under which we and Boustead had originally intended for Boustead to be engaged to act as an exclusive
underwriter in our initial public offering. To date, we have been unable to reach a settlement with Boustead. On April 30, 2021, Boustead
filed a statement of claim with FINRA demanding to arbitrate the dispute, and is seeking, among other things, monetary damages against
the Company and D.A. Davidson & Co. The matter is presently scheduled to be heard before a FINRA arbitration panel over six non-consecutive
days in the months of April and May 2023. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to any claims that Boustead may assert, and we
do not believe that such claims will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. However,
we have agreed to indemnify D.A. Davidson & Co. and the other underwriters who participated in our initial public offering against
any liability or expense they may incur or be subject to arising out of the Boustead dispute. In addition, Chenlong Tan, our Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer and a beneficial owner more than 5% of our common stock, has agreed to reimburse us for any judgments,
fines and amounts paid or actually incurred by us or an indemnitee in connection with such legal action or in connection with any settlement
agreement entered into by us or an indemnitee up to a maximum of $3.5 million in the aggregate, with the sole source of funding for such
reimbursement to come from sales of shares then owned by Mr. Tan. For further information, see “Risk Factors –
Prior to
our initial public offering we unilaterally terminated an engagement agreement with Boustead Securities LLC and may be subject to litigation
in the event we are not able to come to agreement on the amounts Boustead deems itself to be owed under such agreement ” and
“Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2022.
Other than the above, we are
not presently party to any pending or other threatened legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or operating results, although from time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings in
the ordinary course of business.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our failure to meet
the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) could result in a de-listing of our common stock.
If
we fail to maintain the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, including maintaining the minimum closing bid price requirement of $1.00
per share, Nasdaq will take steps to de-list our common stock. As a result of several factors, including but not limited to recent market
sentiment concerning our industry, the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic and its effects on the global marketplace, recent volatility in the financial
markets generally due to the expectation of a tightening in monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other geopolitical events,
the per share price of our common stock has declined below the minimum bid price threshold required for continued listing. Were we to
be delisted from Nasdaq, such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your
ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities
and obtain additional financing in the future.
On
November 9, 2022, we received a deficiency notice from Nasdaq (the “Deficiency Notice”) informing us that our common stock
had failed to comply with the $1.00 minimum bid price required for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(1) (“Rule
5550(a)(1)”) based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the
Deficiency Notice. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been given 180 calendar days from September 9, 2022,
or until May 8, 2023, to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(1). Thus, if at any time before May 8, 2023 the bid price of our common stock
closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide us with written confirmation that
we have regained compliance.
If we do not regain compliance
with Rule 5550(a)(1) by May 8, 2023, we may be afforded a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, we would be
required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for
the Nasdaq, except for the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, we would be required to notify Nasdaq of our intent and plan to
cure the deficiency during the second compliance period.
In
the event of a de-listing or threatened de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq Rules, but we can provide
no assurances that the listing of our common stock would be restored, that our common stock will remain above the Nasdaq minimum bid price
requirement or that we otherwise will remain in compliance with the Nasdaq Rules.
