NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation Farmer Bros. Co., a Delaware corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company”), is a leading coffee roaster, wholesaler, equipment servicer and distributor of coffee, tea, and other allied products manufactured under our owned brands, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial data have been included. Operating results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 2, 2022, and the Form 10-K/A filed on October 27, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”).
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries FBC Finance Company, a California corporation, Coffee Bean Holding Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation and, the parent company of Coffee Bean International, Inc., an Oregon corporation, China Mist Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Boyd Assets Co., a Delaware corporation. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis using currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from those estimates. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies For a detailed discussion about the Company’s significant accounting policies, see Note 2, “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, ” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2022 Form 10-K.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were no significant updates made to the Company’s significant accounting policies. Cash Equivalents At December 31, 2022, we had $ 17.6
million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $ 2.3
million in restricted cash on deposit in broker accounts to satisfy margin requirements associated with certain coffee-related derivative instruments resulting from a decline in the “C” market price of green coffee during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Further changes in commodity prices and the number of coffee-related derivative instruments held could have a significant impact on cash deposit requirements under our broker and counterparty agreements and may adversely affect our liquidity. At June 30, 2022, none of the cash in the Company’s coffee-related derivative margin accounts was restricted. Further changes in commodity prices and the number of coffee-related derivative instruments held could have a significant impact on cash deposit requirements under certain of the Company's broker and counterparty agreements. Concentration of Credit Risk At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash in financial institutions (in excess of federally insured limits), derivative instruments and trade receivables.
6 Farmer Bros. Co. Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The Company does not have any credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral in support of its net derivative asset positions.
Approximately
36 % and
35 % of the Company’s accounts receivable balance was with five customers at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company estimates its maximum credit risk for accounts receivable at the amount recorded on the balance sheet. The accounts receivables are generally short-term and all estimated credit losses have been appropriately considered in establishing the allowance for credit losses. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”). ASUs not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or expected to have minimal impact on its consolidated financial statements. The following table provides a brief description of the recent ASUs applicable to the Company: Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Facilitation of the Effect of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” (“ASU 2020-04”) The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is being discontinued between December 2021 and June 2023. The Company has not entered into any new contracts after December 31, 2021. With the overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month USD LIBOR rates being published through June 30, 2023, we will continue to leverage these for the existing contracts.
ASU 2020-04 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rate.
Issuance date of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Company does not anticipate any material impacts on its consolidated financial statements.
Note 3. Leases The Company has entered into leases for building facilities, vehicles and other equipment. The Company’s leases have remaining contractual terms through January 31, 2030, some of which have options to extend the lease for up to
10
years. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms are deemed not to include options to extend the lease renewal until it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
The components of lease expense are as follows:

Derivative Instruments Derivative Instruments Held Coffee-Related Derivative Instruments The Company is exposed to commodity price risk associated with its price to be fixed green coffee purchase contracts, which are described further in Note 2, “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2022 Form 10-K. The Company utilizes forward and option contracts to manage exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows from forecasted purchases of green coffee attributable to commodity price risk. Certain of these coffee-related derivative instruments utilized for risk management purposes have been designated as cash flow hedges, while other coffee-related derivative instruments have not been designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting despite hedging the Company’s future cash flows on an economic basis.
The following table summarizes the notional volumes for the coffee-related derivative instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: (In thousands) December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:   Long coffee pounds 3,638   4,200   Derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges:   Long coffee pounds 8,377   516     Short coffee pounds (4,688) —        Total 7,327   4,716   Coffee-related derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2022 will expire within
12
months. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 approximately  50 % and
89 %, respectively, of the Company's outstanding coffee-related derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges.
Interest Rate Swap Derivative Instruments Pursuant to an International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) Master Agreement which was effective March 20, 2019, the Company on March 27, 2019, entered into an interest rate swap transaction utilizing a notional amount of $ 80.0
million, with an effective date of April 11, 2019 and a maturity date of
October 11, 2023
(the “Rate Swap”). In December 2019, the Company amended the notional amount to $ 65.0
million. The Rate Swap was intended to manage the Company’s interest rate risk on its floating-rate indebtedness under the Company’s revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the Rate Swap, the Company received 1-month LIBOR, subj ect to a
0 % fl oor, and made payments based on a fixed rate of
2.1975 %.
The Company had designated the Rate Swap derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge; however, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Company de-designated the Rate Swap derivative instrument. As a result, the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income, or “AOCI” was frozen at the time of de-designation. The Company recognized $ 0.3
million and $ 0.6
million, out of AOCI and into interest expense for the three and six months ended
8 Farmer Bros. Co. Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) December 31, 2022. The remaining balance of $ 0.8
million frozen in AOCI will be amortized over the life of the Rate Swap through October 11, 2023. In connection with the revolver credit facility agreement entered into by the Company in April 2021 (see
Note 11
for details), the Company also executed a new ISDA agreement (the “Amended Rate Swap”) to transfer its interest swap to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”).
Under the terms of the Amended Rate Swap, the Company receives 1-month LIBOR, subject to a
0 % floor, and makes payments based on a fixed rate of
2.4725 %, an increase of
0.275 % from its original Rate Swap fixed rate of
2.1975 %. The Amended Rate Swap utilizes the same notional amount of
$ 65.0
million
and maturity date of October 11, 2023 as the original interest rate swap.
The Company did not designate the Amended Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge.
The Company’s obligations under the Amended Rate Swap are secured by the collateral which secures the loans under the new Revolver Credit Facility
(see
Note 11
for details)
on a pari passu and pro rata basis with the principal of such loans.

Additionally, under certain coffee derivative agreements, the Company maintains accounts with its counterparties to facilitate financial derivative transactions in support of its risk management activities. The following table presents the Company’s net exposure from its offsetting derivative asset and liability positions, as well as cash collateral on deposit with its counterparties as of the reporting dates indicated: (In thousands) Gross Amount Reported on Balance Sheet Netting Adjustments Cash Collateral Posted Net Exposure December 31, 2022 Derivative Assets $ 1,836   $ ( 566 ) $ —   $ 1,270   Derivative Liabilities 5,352   ( 566 ) —   4,786   June 30, 2022 Derivative Assets 3,365   ( 2,349 ) —   1,016   Derivative Liabilities 2,349   ( 2,349 ) —   —   Cash Flow Hedges
Changes in the fair value of the Company’s coffee-related derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified into cost of goods sold in the same period or periods in which the hedged forecasted purchases affect earnings, or when it is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period. Based on recorded values at December 31, 2022, $ 1.5
million of net losses on coffee-related derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge are expected to be reclassified into cost of goods sold within the next twelve months. These recorded values are based on market prices of the commodities as of December 31, 2022.
The Company had designated the Rate Swap derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge; however, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Company de-designated the Rate Swap derivative instrument. The frozen AOCI is subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the period or periods when the hedged transaction affects earnings or when it is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period. As of December 31, 2022, $ 0.8
million of net losses on the Rate Swap de-designated as a cash flow hedge are expected to be reclassified into interest expense within the next twelve months. 10 Farmer Bros. Co.

Employee Benefit Plans Single Employer Pension Plans As of December 31, 2022, the Company has two defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, the "Farmer Bros. Plan" and the “Hourly Employees' Plan”. The Company froze benefit accruals and participation in these plans effective June 30, 2011 and October 1, 2016, respectively. After the plan freezes, participants do not accrue any benefits under the plan, and new hires are not eligible to participate in the plan.
The net periodic benefit (credit) cost for the defined benefit pension plans is as follows:   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Interest cost $ 1,156   $ 848   $ 2,312   $ 1,696   Expected return on plan assets ( 1,009 ) ( 1,237 ) ( 2,018 ) ( 2,474 ) Amortization of net loss (1) 281   339   563   678   Net periodic benefit (credit) cost $ 428   $ ( 50 ) $ 857   $ ( 100 ) ___________ (1) These amounts represent the estimated portion of the net loss in AOCI that is expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the current fiscal year.  Weighted-Average Assumptions Used to Determine Net Periodic Benefit Cost   December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Discount rate 4.50 % 2.60 % Expected long-term return on plan assets 6.50 % 6.25 %   Multiemployer Pension Plans
The Company participates in one multiemployer defined benefit pension plan that is union sponsored and collectively bargained for the benefit of certain employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, called the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan ("WCTPP"). The Company makes contributions to this plan generally based on the number of hours worked by the participants in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The company also contributes to two defined contribution pension plans (All Other Plans) that are union sponsored and collectively bargained for the benefit of certain employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. Contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans were as follows:   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Contributions to WCTPP
$ 378   $ 226   $ 665   $ 471   Contributions to All Other Plans 8   10   16   17   Multiemployer Plans Other Than Pension Plans The Company participates in
nine
multiemployer defined contribution plans other than pension plans that provide medical, vision, dental and disability benefits for active, union-represented employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The plans are subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and provide that participating employers make monthly contributions to the plans in an amount as specified in the collective bargaining agreements. Also, the plans provide that participants make self-payments to the plans, the amounts of which are negotiated through the collective bargaining process. The Company’s participation in these plans is governed by collective bargaining agreements which expire on or before January 31, 2025. 401(k) Plan Farmer Bros. Co. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) is available to all eligible employees. The 401(k) Plan match portion is available to all eligible employees who have worked more than
1,000
hours during a calendar year and were employed at the end of the calendar year. Participants in the 401(k) Plan may choose to contribute a percentage of their annual pay subject to the maximum contribution allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company's matching contribution is discretionary, based on approval by the Company's Board of Directors.
Beginning in July 2021, the Company re-instated a 401(k) Plan matching program (the “401(k) Match”) for non-union employees, by matching
50 % of any non-union employee's annual contribution to the 401(k) Plan, up to
6 % of such employee's eligible income, which is substantially similar to the program prior to its suspension in March 2020.
13 Farmer Bros. Co. Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Beginning in January 2022, the Company amended the 401(k) Match, whereby the Company on a quarterly basis, will contribute, instead of cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 1.00
per share (the “Common Stock”) with a value equal to
50 % of any non-union employee's annual contribution to the 401(k) Plan, up to
6 % of such employee's eligible income. The terms of the match are substantially the same as the safe-harbor non-elective contribution. The Company recorded matching contributions of $ 0.6
million
and
$ 1.1
million in operating expenses in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively and $ 0.5
million and $ 1.1
million in operating expenses in the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
Additionally, the Company makes an annual safe harbor non-elective contribution of Common Stock equal to
4 % of each eligible participant’s annual plan compensation. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company contributed a total of
264,712
and
82,437
of shares Common Stock with a value of $ 0.6
million and $ 0.7
million, respectively, to eligible participants’ annual plan compensation. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company contributed a total of
521,764
and
134,034
of shares Common Stock with a value of $ 1.2
million and $ 1.3
million, respectively, to eligible participants’ annual plan compensation. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company eliminated the
4 % non-elective contribution and changed the Company match to
100 % of the first
3 % each eligible employee contributes plus
50 % on the next
2 % they contribute. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company amended the 401(k) Plan to, among other things, increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the 401(k) Plan by
2,000,000
additional shares of Common Stock and permit participants in the 401(k) Plan to invest a portion of their 401(k) Plan accounts into Common Stock.
Effective January 1, 2022, the Company merged the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) into the 401(k) Plan and transferred all of the assets and shares in the ESOP to the 401(k) Plan. Postretirement Benefits Retiree Medical Plan and Death Benefit On March 23, 2020, the Company announced a plan to amend and terminate the postretirement medical benefit plan that covers qualified non-union retirees and certain qualified union retirees (“Retiree Medical Plan”) effective January 1, 2021. As a result, the re-measurement generated a prior service credit. This credit, along with actuarial gains, were amortized over the remaining months of the plan through January 1, 2021. The Retiree Medical Plan is now terminated. The Company provides a postretirement death benefit (the “Death Benefit” Plan) to certain employees and retirees, subject, in the case of current employees, to continued employment with the Company until retirement and certain other conditions related to the manner of employment termination and manner of death. In June 2021, the Company amended the Death Benefit Plan effective immediately, which triggered re-measurement of the plan. In conjunction with the amendment, the Company created a new Executive Death Benefit Plan (the “Executive Death Benefit Plan”) for a small group of participants in the Death Benefit Plan. Under the Executive Death Benefit Plan, the participants receive the same benefits they would have received under the Death Benefit Plan.
The following table shows the components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the Retiree Medical Plan and Death Benefit Plan for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Revolver Credit Facility had a commitment of up to $ 80.0
million and a maturity date of April 25, 2025. On August 8, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Increase Joinder and Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement (the “2nd Amendment”), with Wells Fargo, as administrative agent for each member of the lender group and as a lender. The 2nd Amendment amends certain terms and conditions of the Revolver Credit Facility by, among other things: (i) increasing the maximum revolver amount by $ 10.0
million to an aggregate maximum revolver commitment amount of $ 90.0  million; and (ii) replacing the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) interest rate benchmark (which had an applicable margin of
2.25 % for LIBOR rate loans) with the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) interest rate benchmark (which has an applicable margin of
1.75 % for SOFR rate loans). Availability under the Revolver Credit Facility is calculated as the lesser of (a) $ 90.0  million or (b) the amount equal to the sum of (i)
85 % of eligible accounts receivable (less a dilution reserve), plus (ii) the lesser of: (a)
80 % of eligible raw material inventory, eligible in-transit inventory and eligible finished goods inventory (collectively, “Eligible Inventory”), and (b)
85 % of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, minus (c) applicable reserve.
The Revolver Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Revolver Credit Facility becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments. Prior Term Loan Facility On April 26, 2021, the Company borrowed $ 47.5
million of term loans from various financial institutions as part of a Credit Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2021 (the “Prior Term Loan Facility”). The following is a summary description of the Prior Term Loan Facility:
1. total commitment of $ 47.5
million in the form of a term loan; 2. maturity date of April 25, 2025 and scheduled payback required on the principal prior to the maturity date; 3. fully collateralized by all existing and future capital stock of the borrowers (other than the Company) and all of the borrowers' personal and real property; 4. interest under the Term Loan is either LIBOR + 6.5% per annum, or (b) base rate + 5.50% per annum, with a 3% floor on base rate; and 5. commencing on the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2022, quarterly minimum EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements specified therein.
Principal payments on the Prior Term Loan Facility were due quarterly in the amount of $ 0.95  million. New Term Loan Facility On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement (the “3rd Amendment”), with the lenders party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, as administrative agent for each member of the lender group and as a lender. The 3rd Amendment amends certain terms and conditions of the Revolver Credit Facility by, among other things: (i) adding a new $ 47.0  million term loan (the “Term Loan”); (ii) extending the maturity date of the Company’s obligations under the Revolver Credit Facility from April 25, 2025 to April 26, 2027; provided, that if the maturity date of the Revolver Commitments is extended on or prior to April 1, 2027 to a date that is after April 26, 2027, then the maturity of the Term
15 Farmer Bros. Co. Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Loan Facility shall be August 31, 2037; (iii) releasing liens securing the obligations under the Revolver Facility Credit on various real properties owned by the Company; (iv) commencing on or around June 30, 2023, obligating the Company to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, calculated for each 12-month period ending on the last day of each fiscal month, of at least
1 :00 to 1:00; and (v) lowering the Letter of Credit Fee payable with respect to letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement from
2.25 % to
1.75 % of the average amount of the Letter of Credit Usage during the immediately preceding month.
The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used to repay the outstanding term loans under the Term Credit Facility Agreement. With the repayment of the Company’s outstanding loans and other obligations under the Term Credit Facility Agreement, the Company is no longer subject to the minimum EBITDA covenants contained therein. As part of the refinancing transaction, the Company expensed $ 1.5  million in unamortized deferred financing costs, discount and payoff premium for the six months ended December 31, 2022, which are included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Covenant Compliance The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type that, among other things, require the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants and restrict the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase its stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of its business, transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Revolver Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”).
Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Term Loan Facility Agreement and the Revolver Credit Facility becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments which could impact our liquidity. Accordingly, an event of default could have a material and adverse impact on us. If we are unable to cure, obtain a waiver from the lenders, or refinance the Credit Facilities, we anticipate not being able to meet the current contractual covenant beginning June 30, 2023. We consider it probable that management’s plans, including the options described above, will be able to alleviate the potential noncompliance with the debt covenant prior to June 30, 2023. Interest Rate Swap In connection with the
Revolver Credit Facility and Prior Term Loan Facility , the Company executed the Amended Rate Swap. Under the terms of the Amended Rate Swap, the Company receives 1-month LIBOR, subject to a
0 % floor, and makes payments based on a fixed rate of
2.4725 %, an increase of
0.275 % from its original interest rate swap fixed rate of
2.1975 %. The Amended Rate Swap utilizes the same notional amount of $ 65.0
million and maturity date of October 11, 2023 as the original interest rate swap. Beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company is required to make monthly principal payments on the Term Loan debt obligation in the amount of $ 261  thousand. At
December 31, 2022 , the Company had outstanding borrowings on the Revolver Credit Facility of
$ 67.0
million
and had utilized
$ 4.1
million
of the letters of credit sublimit. At December 31, 2022, we had

three-year
period from the grant date, and are cash-settled upon vesting based on the closing share price of Common Stock on the vesting date.
The CSRSUs are accounted for as liability awards, and compensation expense is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period net of forfeitures. Compensation expense is remeasured at each reporting date with a cumulative adjustment to compensation cost during the period based on changes in the closing share price of Common Stock.

The income tax expense and the related effective tax rates are as follows (in thousands, except effective tax rate): Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income tax expense $ 40   $ 126   $ 83   $ 188   Effective tax rate ( 0.3 ) % ( 2.4 ) % ( 0.4 ) % ( 2.5 ) % The Company’s interim tax provision is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete taxable events that may occur during the quarter. The Company recognizes the effects of tax legislation in the period in which the law is enacted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the Company estimates the related temporary differences to reverse. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if a valuation allowance is required. In making such assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified, such as recent operating results, and less consideration is given to less objective indicators such as future income projections. 19 Farmer Bros. Co. Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Tax expense in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 40  thousand compared to $ 0.1  million in the three months ended December 31, 2021, which primarily relates to state income tax expense in certain jurisdictions. Tax expense in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 83  thousand compared to $ 0.2  million in the six months ended December 31, 2021, which primarily relates to state income tax expense in certain jurisdictions.
The Company files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. With limited exceptions, as of December 31, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for any years prior to 2019. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company does not believe the outcome of any future audit will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Note 16. Net Loss Per Common Share   Basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing diluted net loss attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect, if dilutive, of the exercise of in-the-money stock options, unvested performance-based restricted stock units, and shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Participating Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $ 1.00
per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”), as converted, during the periods presented. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such option’s exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) and unvested performance-based restricted stock units because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net earnings loss per common share: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (In thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Undistributed net loss available to common stockholders $ ( 13,608 ) $ ( 5,334 ) $ ( 20,982 ) $ ( 7,830 ) Undistributed net loss available to nonvested restricted stockholders and holders of convertible preferred stock —   ( 234 ) —   ( 309 ) Net loss available to common stockholders - basic $ ( 13,608 ) $ ( 5,568 ) $ ( 20,982 ) $ ( 8,139 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 18,723,957   18,106,151   19,243,707   18,034,658   Effect of dilutive securities: Shares issuable under stock options —   —   —   —   Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 18,723,957   18,106,151   19,243,707   18,034,658   Net loss available to common stockholders per common share—basic $ ( 0.73 ) $ ( 0.31 ) $ ( 1.09 ) $ ( 0.45 ) Net loss available to common stockholders per common share—diluted $ ( 0.73 ) $ ( 0.31 ) $ ( 1.09 ) $ ( 0.45 ) The following table summarizes weighted average anti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Shares issuable under stock options 410,907   481,429   410,907   487,088   Shares issuable under convertible preferred stock —   444,849   —   444,849   Shares issuable under PBRSUs 501,141   498,210   469,297   437,211   Note 17.

Revenue Recognition The Company’s primary sources of revenue are sales of coffee, tea and culinary products. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer and in amounts that the Company expects to collect. The timing of revenue recognition takes into consideration the various shipping terms applicable to the Company’s sales.
The Company delivers products to customers through Direct-store-delivery (“DSD”) to the Company’s customers at their place of business and Direct ship from the Company’s warehouse to the customer’s warehouse, facility or address. Each delivery or shipment made to a third party customer is to satisfy a performance obligation. Performance obligations generally occur at a point in time and are satisfied when control of the goods passes to the customer. The Company is entitled to collection of the sales price under normal credit terms in the regions in which it operates. The Company disaggregates net sales from contracts with customers based on the characteristics of the products sold: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (In thousands) $ % of total $ % of total $ % of total $ % of total Net Sales by Product Category: Coffee (Roasted) $ 82,725   62.3   % $ 75,506   63.8   % $ 161,019   63.4   % $ 146,104   64.4   % Tea & Other Beverages (1) 26,686   20.2   % 22,891   19.3   % 47,632   18.7   % 41,928   18.5   % Culinary 16,372   12.3   % 13,913   11.7   % 31,269   12.3   % 26,988   11.9   % Spices 5,709   4.3   % 5,059   4.3   % 11,733   4.6   % 10,258   4.5   % Net sales by product category 131,492   99.1   % 117,369   99.1   % 251,653   99.0   % 225,278   99.3   % Delivery Surcharge 1,200   0.9   % 1,076   0.9   % 2,420   1.0   % 1,529   0.7   %      Net sales $ 132,692   100.0   % $ 118,445   100.0   % $ 254,073   100.0   % $ 226,807   100.0   % ____________ (1) Includes all beverages other than roasted coffee, including frozen liquid coffee, and iced and hot tea, including cappuccino, cocoa, granitas, and concentrated and ready-to drink cold brew and iced coffee.

Receivables from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts receivable, net” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, “Accounts receivable, net” included, $ 49.1
million and $ 44.2
million, respectively, in receivables from contracts with customers. Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies For a detailed discussion about the Company’s commitments and contingencies, see Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2022 Form 10-K. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, other than the following, or as otherwise disclosed herein, there were no material changes in the Company’s commitments and contingencies. Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2022, the Company had committed to purchase green coffee inventory totaling $ 76.2
million under fixed-price contracts, and $ 14.6
million in inventory and other purchases under non-cancelable purchase orders. 21 Farmer Bros. Co. Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Legal Proceedings Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“CERT”) v. Brad Berry Company Ltd., et al., Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles On August 31, 2012, CERT filed an amendment to a private enforcement action adding a number of companies as defendants, including the Company’s subsidiary, Coffee Bean International, Inc., which sell coffee in California under the State of California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Prop 65”). The suit alleges that the defendants have failed to issue clear and reasonable warnings in accordance with Prop 65 that the coffee they produce, distribute, and sell contains acrylamide. This lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court (the “Court”). CERT alleges that the Company and the other defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under Prop 65. Plaintiff seeks equitable relief and civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of $2,500 per day per violation of Prop 65. The Plaintiff asserts that every consumed cup of coffee, absent a compliant warning, is equivalent to a violation under Prop 65. The Company, as part of a joint defense group (“JDG”) organized to defend against the lawsuit, disputes the claims of CERT. Acrylamide is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts (parts per billion) as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process. A series of procedural and legislative developments occurred in the ensuing years, and at hearings in August 2020, the Court denied CERT’s motion for summary judgment and granted the JDG’s motion for summary judgment. Notice of Judgment in favor of defendants was entered on October 6, 2020. CERT has appealed. The Company believe that the likelihood that the Company will ultimately incur a loss in connection with this litigation is less than reasonably possible. The Company is a party to various other pending legal and administrative proceedings. It is management’s opinion that the outcome of such proceedings will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Note 20. Sales of Assets Sale of Branch Property During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the following branch properties:

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our financial condition, our products, our business strategy, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words like “anticipates,” “estimates,” “projects,” “expects,” “plans,” “believes,” “intends,” “will,” “could,” “may,” “assumes” and other words of similar meaning. These statements are based on management’s beliefs, assumptions, estimates and observations of future events based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made and include any statements that do not relate to any historical or current fact. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements due in part to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on September 2, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”), as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the SEC. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, severe weather, levels of consumer confidence in national and local economic business conditions, the impact of labor shortages, the increase of costs due to inflation, an economic downturn caused by any pandemic, epidemic or other disease outbreak, comparable or similar to COVID-19, the success of our turnaround strategy, the impact of capital improvement projects, the adequacy and availability of capital resources to fund our existing and planned business operations and our capital expenditure requirements, the relative effectiveness of compensation-based employee incentives in causing improvements in our performance, the capacity to meet the demands of our large national account customers, the extent of execution of plans for the growth of our business and achievement of financial metrics related to those plans, our success in retaining and/or attracting qualified employees, our success in adapting to technology and new commerce channels, the effect of the capital markets as well as other external factors on stockholder value, fluctuations in availability and cost of green coffee, competition, organizational changes, the effectiveness of our hedging strategies in reducing price and interest rate risk, changes in consumer preferences, our ability to provide sustainability in ways that do not materially impair profitability, changes in the strength of the economy, including any effects from inflation, business conditions in the coffee industry and food industry in general, our continued success in attracting new customers, variances from budgeted sales mix and growth rates, weather and special or unusual events, as well as other risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the SEC.

NM - Not Meaningful Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2021
Net Sales Net sales in the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $14.2 million, or 12.0%, to $132.7 million from $118.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Net sales in the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $27.3 million, or 12.0%, to $254.1 million from $226.8 million in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to higher pricing compared to prior periods, partially offset by a decline in sales volume primarily with the direct ship sales channel.
The following table presents the effect of changes in unit sales, and unit pricing and product mix in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year (in millions): Three Months Ended
December 31,
2022 vs. 2021 Six Months Ended
December 31,
2022 vs. 2021 Effect of change in unit sales $ (15.5) $ (31.0) Effect of pricing and product mix changes 29.7  58.3  Total increase in net sales $ 14.2  $ 27.3  Unit sales decreased 10.4% and average unit price increased by 25.0% in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, resulting in an increase in our net sales of 12.0%. Unit sales decreased 10.9% and average unit price increased by 25.8% in the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, resulting in an increase in our net sales of 12.0%. Average unit price increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 due to a higher mix of product sold via our DSD network versus Direct ship, as Direct ship has a lower average unit price. There were no new product category introductions which had a material impact on our net sales in the six months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased to $30.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $35.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin decreased to 22.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 29.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to higher product costs and an increase in underlying commodities pricing compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
25 Gross profit decreased to $57.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $66.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin decreased to 22.4% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 29.3% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to higher product costs and an increase in underlying commodities pricing compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
Operating Expenses
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, operating expenses decreased $2.5 million to $37.1 million, or 28.0% of net sales, from $39.6 million, or 33.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This decrease was due to a $1.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, and a $0.8 million decrease in selling expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense.
In the six months ended December 31, 2022, operating expenses decreased $4.8 million to $68.0 million, or 26.8% of net sales, from $72.8 million, or 32.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This decrease was due to $2.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses and a $2.7 million increase in net gains from the sale of branch properties and other assets during the six months ended December 31, 2022, offset by a $0.8 million increase in selling expenses. The increase in selling expenses during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in payroll related costs. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense and $1.9 million gain on settlement related to the acquisition of Boyd Coffee Company, which included the cancellation of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and settlement of liabilities, partially offset by an increase in contract services. Total Other Expense
Total other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $6.1 million to $6.9 million compared to $0.7 million of expense in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Total other expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $8.6 million to $9.9 million compared to $1.3 million of expense in the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest expense in the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $1.1 million to $3.6 million from $2.5 million in the prior year period. Interest expense in the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $2.7 million to $8.2 million from $5.5 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily related to the write off of $1.5 million in deferred financing costs, discount and payoff premium incurred as a result of the refinancing transaction on August 31, 2022, an increase in debt obligations, and an increase in interest rates compared to the prior year period. Other, net in the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $5.0 million to Other Expense of $3.3 million compared to Other Income of $1.8 million in the prior year period. Other, net in the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $5.9 million to Other Expense of $1.7 million compared to Other Income of $4.2 million in the prior year period. The change was primarily a result of mark-to-market net losses on coffee-related derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges in the current period compared to net mark-to-market gains in the prior year period. The mark-to-market losses are primarily due to a decrease in the coffee-related commodity market.
Income Taxes In the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $40.0 thousand and $0.1 million, respectively. In the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $83.0 thousand and $0.2 million, respectively. See
Note 15 ,
Income Taxes , of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
26 Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to net loss determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating performance: “EBITDA”
is defined as net loss excluding the impact of: • income tax expense; • interest expense; and • depreciation and amortization expense.
“EBITDA Margin”
is defined as EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. “Adjusted EBITDA”
is defined as net loss excluding the impact of: • income tax expense; • interest expense; • depreciation and amortization expense; • 401(k), ESOP and share-based compensation expense; • gain on settlement with Boyd’s sellers; • net loss (gains) from sales of assets; and • severance costs. “Adjusted EBITDA Margin”
is defined as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. For purposes of calculating EBITDA and EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, we have not adjusted for the impact of interest expense on our pension and postretirement benefit plans. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, management utilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP measures, when evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating performance against internal financial forecasts and budgets.
We believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use these measures internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors. EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for non-GAAP financial measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our Business We are a leading coffee roaster, wholesaler, equipment servicer and distributor of coffee, tea and other allied products manufactured under our owned brands, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers. We were founded in 1912, incorporated in California in 1923, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004. Our principal office is located in Northlake, Texas. We operate in one business segment. We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurants, department and convenience store retailers, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, and foodservice distributors. Through our sustainability, stewardship, environmental efforts, and leadership we are not only committed to serving the finest products available, considering the cost needs of the customer, but also insist on their sustainable cultivation, manufacture and distribution whenever possible. Our product categories consist of a robust line of roast and ground coffee, including organic, Direct Trade, Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®, Fair Trade Certified™® and other sustainably-produced offerings; frozen liquid coffee; flavored and unflavored iced and hot teas; including organic and Rainforest Alliance Certified™; culinary products including premium spices, pancake and biscuit mixes, gravy and sauce mixes, soup bases, dressings, syrups and sauces, and coffee-related products such as coffee filters, cups, sugar and creamers; and other beverages including cappuccino, cocoa, granitas, and other blender-based beverages and concentrated and ready-to-drink cold brew and iced coffee. We offer a comprehensive approach to our customers by providing not only a breadth of high-quality products, but also value added services such as market insight, beverage planning, and equipment placement and service.
We operate production facilities in Northlake, Texas and Portland, Oregon. We distribute our products from our Northlake, Texas and Portland, Oregon production facilities, as well as separate distribution centers in Portland, Oregon; Northlake, Illinois; Moonachie, New Jersey; and Rialto, California. Our products reach our customers primarily through our nationwide DSD network of 241 delivery routes and 102 branch warehouses as of December 31, 2022, or direct-shipped via common carriers or third-party distributors. DSD sales are primarily made “off-truck” to our customers at their places of business. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity as the spread of the pandemic and resulting governmental actions have decreased the demand for our products. An economic downturn caused by any pandemic, epidemic or other disease outbreak, comparable or similar to COVID-19, may also cause substantial changes in consumer behavior and demand for our products, adversely affecting results of operations and our financial position, some of which we may not be able to predict with certainty. For other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2022 Form 10‑K, which is accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  28 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition The following table summarizes our debt obligations: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 (In thousands) Debt Origination Date Maturity Principal
Borrowing Amount Carrying Value Weighted Average Interest Rate (1) Carrying Value Weighted Average Interest Rate Revolver Various 4/26/2027 N/A $ 67,000  5.05  % $ 63,000  2.75  % Term Loan 8/31/2022 4/26/2027 $47,000 46,217  45,600       Total $ 113,217  $ 108,600  __________ (1) The weighted average interest rate excludes the fixed rate on the de-designated Amended Rate Swap On April 26, 2021, the Company entered into the Revolver Credit Facility, which was amended on August 8, 2022 and August 31, 2022, and entered into the Prior Term Loan Facility, which was paid in full as part of a refinancing transaction, as described in more detail in Note 11,
Debt Obligations , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.
The Credit Facilities have a commitment of up to $90.0 million and a maturity date of April 26, 2027. Availability under the revolver is calculated as the lesser of (a) $90.0 million and (b) the amount derived from pursuant to a borrowing base composed of the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable (less a dilution reserve), plus (ii) the lesser of: (a) 80% of eligible raw material inventory, eligible in-transit inventory and eligible finished goods inventory (collectively, “Eligible Inventory”), and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of Eligible Inventory, minus (c) applicable reserve. The Term Loan has a principal amount of $47.0 million and a maturity date of April 26, 2027.
The Credit Facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Credit Facilities becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments. As of and through December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facilities.
Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default which could accelerate the repayment obligations and impact our liquidity. Accordingly, an event of default could have a material and adverse impact on us. If we are unable to cure, obtain a waiver from the lenders, or refinance the Credit Facilities, we anticipate not being able to meet the current contractual covenant beginning June 30, 2023. We consider it probable that management’s plans, including the options described above, will be able to alleviate the potential noncompliance with the debt covenant prior to June 30, 2023. The amended Credit Facilities provide us with increased flexibility to proactively manage our liquidity, working capital, and preserving financial liquidity to mitigate the impact of the uncertain business environment resulting from increased costs due to inflation, fluctuations in the coffee commodity markets, and continue to execute on key strategic initiatives. At December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings on the Revolver Credit Facility of $67.0 million and had utilized $4.1 million of the letters of credit sublimit.
Liquidity We generally finance our operations through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facilities described above. In light of our financial position, operating performance and current economic conditions, including the state of the global capital markets, there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will be able to raise capital by issuing securities. We believe that the Credit Facilities, to the extent available, in addition to our cash flows from operations, collectively, will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to fund our long-term liquidity needs, including contractual obligations, anticipated capital expenditures, principal payments on our Term Loan Credit Facility, as well as working capital requirements, from our operating cash flows and our Revolver Credit Facility to the extent available.
At December 31, 2022, we had $17.6 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $2.3 million in restricted cash on deposit in broker accounts to satisfy margin requirements associated with certain coffee-related derivative instruments resulting from a decline in the “C” market price of green coffee during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Further changes in commodity prices and the number of coffee-related derivative instruments held could have a significant impact on cash deposit requirements under our broker and counterparty agreements and may adversely affect our liquidity. At December 31, 2022, we had $14.3 million available on our Revolver Credit Facility.
29 Cash Flows The significant captions and amounts from our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below:
Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Consolidated Statements of cash flows data (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,563  $ (8,595) Net cash provided by investing activities 2,219  2,288  Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 4,164  (332) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 9,946  $ (6,639) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $3.6 million as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $8.6 million in the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase in cash provided by operations of $12.2 million. The increase primarily reflects a decrease in working capital driven by a decrease in inventory, partially offset by lower cash earnings.
Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $2.2 million as compared to $2.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The net change in investing activities was primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million related to proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment partially offset by an increase of $1.8 million in fixed asset purchases during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $4.2 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $0.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The change of $4.5 million was primarily due to net borrowing proceeds of $4.6 million under the Credit Facilities during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Capital Expenditures
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our capital expenditures paid were $7.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate paying between $14.0 million to $16.0 million in capital expenditures. We expect to finance these expenditures through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $11.3 million and $12.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate our depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $5.9 million to $6.0 million per quarter in the remainder of fiscal 2023 based on our existing fixed asset commitments and the useful lives of our intangible assets. Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2022, the Company had committed to purchase green coffee inventory totaling $76.2 million under fixed-price contracts, and $14.6 million in inventory and other purchases under non-cancelable purchase orders. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2022, the Company had operating and finance lease payment commitments totaling $28.4 million. Under our Term Loan Facility, the Company is required to make monthly principal repayments of $0.3 million, beginning in the quarter ending December 31, 2022 . Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see

31 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings on our Revolver Credit Facility of $67.0 million and had utilized
$4.1 million
of the letters of credit sublimit, as well as $46.2 million of debt outstanding under our Term Loan Facility. The weighted average interest rate on our Revolver Credit Facility was 5.05% with a SOFR applicable margin of 1.75%. In addition to the Credit Facilities above, the Company executed an ISDA agreement with Wells Fargo (“Amended Rate Swap”). Under the terms of the Amended Rate Swap, the Company receives 1-month LIBOR, subject to a 0% floor, and makes payments based on a fixed rate of 2.4725%, The Amended Rate Swap utilizes the same notional amount of $65.0 million and maturity date of October 11, 2023 as the original interest rate swap.

Derivative Instruments,
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10‑K for further discussions of our derivative instruments. The following table demonstrates the impact of interest rate changes on our annual interest expense on outstanding borrowings subject to interest rate variability under these Credit Facilities based on the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2022: (In thousands)  Principal Interest Rate Annual Interest Expense  –150 basis points $48,200 4.78  % $2,304  –100 basis points $48,200 5.28  % $2,545  Unchanged $48,200 6.28  % $3,027  +100 basis points $48,200 7.28  % $3,509  +150 basis points $48,200 7.78  % $3,750 Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of green coffee. We value green coffee inventory on the FIFO basis. In the normal course of business we hold a large green coffee inventory and enter into forward commodity purchase agreements with suppliers. We are subject to price risk resulting from the volatility of green coffee prices. Due to competition and market conditions, volatile price increases cannot always be passed on to our customers. See
Note 4 , Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of our derivative instruments. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of December 31, 2022 to net loss and AOCI from a hypothetical 10% change in coffee commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the coffee-related derivative instruments and does not include, when applicable, the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items: Increase (Decrease) to Net Loss Increase (Decrease) to AOCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate (In thousands) Coffee-related derivative instruments (1) $ 694  $ (694) $ 670  $ (670) __________ (1) The Company’s purchase contracts that qualify as normal purchases include green coffee purchase commitments for which the price has been locked in as of December 31, 2022. These contracts are not included in the sensitivity analysis above as the underlying price has been fixed. 32 Item 4.
