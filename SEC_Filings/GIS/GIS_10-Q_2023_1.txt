GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
(1) Background
The accompanying   Consolidated Financial   Statements of   General Mills,   Inc. (we,   us, our,   General Mills,   or the Company)   have been
prepared in   accordance with   accounting principles   generally accepted   in the   United States   (GAAP) for   interim financial   information
and with   the rules   and regulations   for reporting   on Form   10-Q. Accordingly,   they do   not include   certain information   and disclosures
required   for   comprehensive   financial   statements.   In   the   opinion   of   management,   all   adjustments   considered   necessary   for   a   fair
presentation have   been included   and are   of a   normal recurring   nature, including   the elimination   of all   intercompany transactions   and
any   noncontrolling   and redeemable   interests’ share   of those   transactions.   Operating   results for   the fiscal   quarter ended   February 26,
2023,   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year   ending May 28, 2023.   These   statements   should   be   read   in   conjunction   with   the   Consolidated   Financial   Statements   and   footnotes   included   in   our   Annual
Report on Form   10-K for the fiscal   year ended May   29, 2022. The   accounting policies used   in preparing these   Consolidated Financial
Statements are the same as those described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial   Statements in that Form 10-K.
Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in the “Glossary” section below. (2) Acquisitions and Divestitures
During   the first   quarter   of fiscal   2023,   we   acquired   TNT Crust,   a   manufacturer   of high-quality   frozen pizza   crusts   for   regional   and
national pizza   chains, foodservice   distributors, and   retail outlets,   for a   purchase price   of $ 253.0   million. We   financed the   transaction
with U.S. commercial paper.   We consol   idated the TNT Crust business   into our Consolidated Balance   Sheets and recorded goodwill   of
$ 154.3   million. The   goodwill is   included in   the North   America Foodservice   segment and   is not   deductible for   tax purposes.   The pro
forma   effects   of   this   acquisition   were   not   material.   We   have   conducted   a   preliminary   assessment   of   the   fair   value   of   the   acquired
assets   and   liabilities   of   the   TNT   Crust   business   and   will   continue   to   review   these   items   during   the   measurement   period.   If   new
information is obtained   about facts and circumstances   that existed at the   acquisition date, the   acquisition accounting will   be revised to
reflect the resulting adjustments to   current estimates of these items.   The consolidated results of the   TNT Crust business are reported   in
our North America Foodservice segment on a one-month lag.
During the   first quarter   of fiscal   2023,   we completed   the sale   of our   Helper main   meals and   Suddenly   Salad side   dishes business   to
Eagle Family Foods Group for $ 606.8   million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 442.2   million.
During   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2022,   we   completed   the   sale   of   our   interests   in   Yoplait   SAS,   Yoplait   Marques   SNC,   and   Liberté
Marques   Sàrl   to   Sodiaal   International   (Sodiaal)   in   exchange   for   Sodiaal’s   interest   in   our   Canadian   yogurt   business,   a   modified
agreement   for   the   use   of
Yoplait   and
Liberté   brands   in   the   United   States   and   Canada,   and   cash.   We   recorded   a   net   pre-tax   gain   of
$ 148.8   million on the sale of these businesses during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.   During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold a European dough business   and recorded a net pre-tax gain on sale of $ 21.3   million. During   the   first   quarter   of   fiscal   2022,   we   acquired   Tyson   Foods’   pet   treats   business   for   $ 1.2   billion   in   cash.   We   financed   the
transaction   with   a   combination   of   cash   on   hand   and   short-term   debt.   We   consolidated   the pet   treats   business   into   our   Consolidated
Balance   Sheets   and   recorded   goodwill   of   $ 762.3   million,   indefinite-lived   intangible   assets   for   the
Nudges ,
Top   Chews ,   and
True
Chews   brands   totaling   $ 330.0   million   in   aggregate,   and   a   finite-lived   customer   relationship   asset   of   $ 40.0   million.   The   goodwill   is
included in the Pet segment and is deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma   effects of this acquisition were not material. (3) Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Exit Costs In the nine-month period ended February 26, 2023, we did not undertake   any new restructuring actions. We   recorded $ 2.1   million of
restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and $ 16.0   million of restructuring charges in the nine-month period ended
February 26, 2023, related to restructuring actions previously announced.   We recorded $ 9.3   million of restructuring charges in the
third quarter of fiscal 2022 and $ 7.9   million of restructuring charges in the nine-month period ended   February 27, 2022, related to
restructuring actions previously announced.
We
expect these actions to be completed by the end of
fiscal 2024 .
We paid net $ 30.6   million of cash in the nine-month period ended February 26, 2023, related to restructuring   actions previously
announced. We   paid net $ 70.4   million of cash in the same period of fiscal 2022.

18.9 The reserve balance primarily consists of expected severance payments   associated with restructuring actions.   The charges   recognized in   the roll forward   of our reserves   for restructuring   and other exit   costs do not   include items   charged directly
to expense   (e.g., asset   impairment charges,   accelerated depreciation,   the gain   or loss   on the   sale of   restructured assets,   and the   write- off   of   spare parts)   and other   periodic   exit costs   are   recognized   as incurred,   as those   items are   not reflected   in our   restructuring   and
other exit cost reserves on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (4) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Our   annual   goodwill   and   indefinite-lived   intangible   assets   impairment   test   was   performed   on   the   first   day   of   the   second   quarter   of
fiscal   2023,   and   we   determined   there   was
no   impairment   of   our   intangible   assets   as   their   related   fair   values   were   substantially   in
excess of the   carrying values,   except for   the
Uncle Toby’s   brand intangible   asset. In addition,   while having   significant coverage   as of
our fiscal 2023   assessment date, the
Progresso   and
EPIC   brand intangible assets   had risk of decreasing   coverage. We   will continue to
monitor these businesses for potential impairment. (5) Inventories

1,867.3   (6) Risk Management Activities   Many commodities we   use in the   production and distribution   of our products   are exposed to   market price risks.   We   utilize derivatives
to manage price risk for our principal   ingredients and energy costs, including   grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils   (principally soybean),
dairy products, natural   gas, and diesel fuel.   Our primary objective   when entering into   these derivative contracts   is to achieve   certainty
with   regard   to   the   future   price   of   commodities   purchased   for   use   in   our   supply   chain.   We   manage   our   exposures   through   a
combination of purchase orders, long-term   contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded   futures and options, and over-the-counter   options
and swaps.   We   offset   our exposures   based on   current and   projected market   conditions and   generally seek   to acquire   the inputs   at as
close as possible to or below our planned cost.
We   use derivatives   to manage   our exposure   to changes   in commodity   prices. We   do not   perform the   assessments required   to achieve
hedge   accounting   for   commodity   derivative   positions.   Accordingly,   the   changes   in   the   values   of   these   derivatives   are   recorded
currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Although we do   not meet the   criteria for   cash flow hedge   accounting, we believe   that these instruments   are effective   in achieving our
objective of providing certainty   in the future price of commodities purchased   for use in our supply chain.   Accordingly, for   purposes of
measuring   segment   operating   performance,   these   gains   and   losses   are   reported   in   unallocated   corporate   items   outside   of   segment
operating results   until such   time that   the exposure   we are   managing affects   earnings. At   that time   we reclassify   the gain   or loss   from
unallocated   corporate   items   to   segment   operating   profit,   allowing   our   operating   segments   to   realize   the   economic   effects   of   the
derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,   which remains in unallocated corporate items.   Unallocated corporate items for the quarters and nine-month periods ended   February 26, 2023, and February 27, 2022, included: Quarter Ended

energy inputs and $ 295.0   million related to agricultural inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally   will be utilized within the
next
12   months.
As of February 26, 2023, the notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $ 1,111.8   million.
We
also have net   investments in   foreign subsidiaries   that are denominated   in euros. As   of February   26, 2023, we   hedged a portion   of
these investments with € 2,942.8   million of euro-denominated bonds.

The   fair   values   of   the   derivative   positions   used   in   our   risk   management   activities   and   other   assets   recorded   at   fair   value   were   not
material as of February 26, 2023,   and were Level 1 or Level 2 assets and   liabilities in the fair value hierarchy.   We did   not significantly
change our valuation techniques from prior periods.   During   the third   quarter of   fiscal 2023,   in advance   of a   planned debt   refinancing,   we entered   into a   € 250.0   million notional   amount
forward-starting interest rate swap.   During   the   second   quarter   of   fiscal   2023,   we   entered   into   a   $ 500.0   million   notional   amount   interest   rate   swap   to   convert   our
$ 500.0   million fixed rate notes due
November 18, 2025 , to a floating rate.
Subsequent   to   the   end   of   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2023,   in   advance   of   planned   debt   refinancings,   we   entered   into   € 500.0   million
notional amount of forward-starting interest rate swaps and $ 350.0   million notional amount of treasury locks.
We   offer   certain   suppliers   access   to   third   party   services   that   allow   them   to   view   our   scheduled   payments   online.   The   third-party
services also   allow suppliers   to finance   advances on   our scheduled   payments at   the sole   discretion of   the supplier   and the third   party.
We   have no   economic interest   in these   financing arrangements   and no   direct relationship   with the   suppliers, the   third parties,   or any
financial   institutions   concerning   these   services.   All   of   our   accounts   payable   remain   as   obligations   to   our   suppliers   as   stated   in   our
supplier   agreements.   As of   February 26,   2023, $ 1,483.9   million of   our   total accounts   payable were   payable   to suppliers   who utilize
these   third-party   services.   As   of   February   27,   2022,   $ 1,382.8   million   of   our   total   accounts   payable   were   payable   to   suppliers   who
utilize these third-party services. (7) Debt

respectively,   as of   February   26,   2023.   The fair   value   of long-term   debt   was estimated   using   market quotations   and   discounted   cash
flows based   on our   current incremental   borrowing rates   for similar   types of   instruments. Long   -term debt   is a   Level 2   liability in   the
fair value hierarchy.   In   the   second   quarter   of   fiscal   2023,   we   issued   $ 500.0   million   of

Certain of   our long-term   debt agreements   contain restrictive   covenants.
As of February 26, 2023, we were in compliance with all of
these covenants. (8) Redeemable and Noncontrolling Interests
The   third-party   holder   of   the   General   Mills   Cereals,   LLC   (GMC)   Class A   Interests   receives   quarterly   preferred   distributions   from
available net   income based   on the application   of a   floating preferred   return rate   to the   holder’s capital   account balance   established in
the most recent   mark-to-market valuation   (currently $ 251.5   million). The   floating preferred return   rate on GMC’s   Class A Interests is
the   sum   of   the
three-month Term SOFR   plus
186   basis   points.   The   preferred   return   rate   is   adjusted   every
three years   through   a
negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through   a remarketing auction.
During   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2022,   we   completed   the   sale   of   our   interests   in   Yoplait   SAS,   Yoplait   Marques   SNC,   and   Liberté

brands in the United States and Canada, and cash. Please see Note 2 to the Consolidated   Financial Statements.
Up to   the date   of the   divestiture, Sodiaal   held the remaining   interests in   each of   the entities.   On the   acquisition date,   we recorded   the
fair value   of Sodiaal’s
49   percent interest   in Yoplait   SAS as   a redeemable   interest on   our Consolidated   Balance Sheets.   Sodiaal had
the   right   to put   all or   a portion   of its   redeemable   interest   to us   at   fair value   until the   divestiture   closed   in the   third quarter   of fiscal
2022. In   connection with   the divestiture,   cumulative adjustments   made to   the redeemable   interest related   to the   fair value   put feature
were reversed against additional   paid-in capital, where changes   in the redemption amount   were historically recorded,   and the resulting
carrying value of the noncontrolling interests were included in the calculation   of the gain on divestiture.
A subsidiary of   Yoplait   SAS had an exclusive   milk supply agreement   for its European operations   with Sodiaal through   November 28,
2021. Net purchases totaled $ 99.5   million for the six-month period ended November 28, 2021.
Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of February 26, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these
covenants.

44.4 We estimate the fair value of each stock option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Black-Scholes option- pricing models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and
dividend yield. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option,
excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We
also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially
those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. Our method of selecting
the other valuation assumptions is explained in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022. The   estimated   fair   values   of   stock   options   granted   and   the   assumptions   used   for   the   Black-Scholes   option-pricing   model   were   as

18.7   (15) Income Taxes
During   the   first   quarter   of   fiscal   2023,   the   Inflation   Reduction   Act   (IRA)   was   signed   into   law.   The   IRA   introduces   a   Corporate
Alternative Minimum Tax   beginning in our fiscal 2024   and an excise tax on the   repurchase of corporate   stock starting after January   1,
2023.   We   do not   currently expect the   IRA to have   a material impact   on our financial   results, including our   annual estimated effective
tax rate, or on our liquidity.   The amount of excise tax on   the repurchase of corporate stock   was immaterial in the third quarter   of fiscal
2023.   We will continue   to monitor and assess the impact the IRA may have on our business and financial results.
During fiscal   2022, the   Brazilian tax   authority,   Secretaria da   Receita Federal   do Brasil   (RFB), concluded   audits of   our 2012   through
2018   tax   return   years.   These   audits   included   a   review   of   our   determinations   of   amortization   of   certain   goodwill   arising   from   the
acquisition of   Yoki   Alimentos S.A.   The RFB   has proposed   adjustments that   effectively   eliminate the   goodwill amortization   benefits
related to this transaction. We   believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to continue to contest the disallowance   for all years. (16) Contingencies
During   fiscal   2020,   we   received   notice   from   the   tax   authorities of   the   State of   São   Paulo,   Brazil   regarding   our   compliance   with   its
state sales tax requirements.   As a result, we   have been assessed additional   state sales taxes, interest,   and penalties. We   believe that we
have   meritorious   defenses   against   this   claim   and   will   vigorously   defend   our   position.   As   of   February   26,   2023,   we   are   unable   to
estimate any possible loss and have not recorded a loss contingency for   this matter. (17) Business Segment and Geographic Information
We   operate   in   the   packaged   foods   industry.   In   fiscal   2022,   we   completed   a   new   organization   structure   to   streamline   our   global
operations.   This   global   reorganization   required   us   to   reevaluate   our   operating   segments.   Under   our   new   organization   structure,   our
19
chief operating decision maker assesses performance   and makes decisions about resources to be allocated to   our operating segments as
follows: North America Retail, International,   Pet, and North America Foodservice.   We   have restated   our net   sales by segment   and segment   operating profit   to reflect our   previously reported   operating segment   change.
These   segment   changes   had   no   effect   on   previously   reported   consolidated   net   sales,   operating   profit,   net   earnings   attributable   to
General Mills, or earnings per share.   Our North America Retail   operating segment reflects business   with a wide variety   of grocery stores, mass merchandisers,   membership
stores,   natural   food   chains,   drug,   dollar   and   discount   chains,   convenience   stores,   and   e-commerce   grocery   providers.   Our   product
categories   in   this   business   segment   include   ready-to-eat   cereals,   refrigerated   yogurt,   soup,   meal   kits,   refrigerated   and   frozen   dough
products,   dessert   and   baking   mixes,   frozen   pizza   and   pizza   snacks,   snack   bars,   fruit   snacks,   savory   snacks,   and   a   wide   variety   of
organic products   including ready-to-eat   cereal, frozen   and shelf-stable vegetables,   meal kits, fruit   snacks, snack   bars, and   refrigerated
yogurt.
Our   International   operating   segment   consists   of   retail   and   foodservice   businesses   outside   of   the   United   States   and   Canada.   Our
product categories include super-premium   ice cream and frozen desserts, meal kits, salty snacks,   snack bars, dessert and baking mixes,
and   shelf   stable   vegetables.   We   also   sell   super-premium   ice   cream   and   frozen   desserts   directly   to   consumers   through   owned   retail
shops. Our   International segment   also includes   products manufactured   in the United   States for   export, mainly   to Caribbean   and Latin
American markets, as well as   products we manufacture   for sale to our international   joint ventures. Revenues from   export activities are
reported in the region or country where the end customer is located.
Our Pet operating segment includes   pet food products sold primarily in the   United States and Canada in national   pet superstore chains,
e-commerce retailers,   grocery stores,   regional pet   store chains,   mass merchandisers,   and veterinary   clinics and   hospitals. Our   product
categories include dog and cat food (dry   foods, wet foods, and treats) made with   whole meats, fruits, vegetables and other   high-quality
natural   ingredients.   Our   tailored   pet   product   offerings   address   specific   dietary,   lifestyle,   and   life-stage   needs   and   span   different
product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product   functions, and textures and cuts for wet foods.
Our   North   America   Foodservice   segment   consists   of   foodservice   businesses   in   the   United   States   and   Canada.   Our   major   product
categories   in   our   North   America   Foodservice   operating   segment   are   ready-to-eat   cereals,   snacks,   refrigerated   yogurt,   frozen   meals,
unbaked and   fully baked   frozen dough products,   baking mixes,   and bakery   flour.   Many products we   sell are branded   to the consumer
and nearly   all are   branded to   our customers.   We   sell to   distributors and   operators in   many customer   channels including   foodservice,
vending, and supermarket bakeries.
Operating profit   for these   segments excludes   unallocated corporate   items, gain   or loss   on divestitures,   and restructuring,   impairment,
and   other   exit   costs.   Unallocated   corporate   items   include   corporate   overhead   expenses,   variances   to   planned   North   American
employee   benefits   and   incentives,   certain   charitable   contributions,   restructuring   initiative   project-related   costs,   gains   and   losses   on
corporate investments,   and other   items that   are not   part of   our measurement   of segment   operating performance.   These include   gains
and   losses   arising   from   the   revaluation   of   certain   grain   inventories   and   gains   and   losses   from   mark-to-market   valuation   of   certain
commodity positions   until passed back   to our operating   segments. These items   affecting operating   profit are centrally   managed at   the
corporate   level   and   are   excluded   from   the   measure   of   segment   profitability   reviewed   by   executive   management.   Under   our   supply
chain organization, our manufacturing,   warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated   across our operations in order
to maximize   efficiency   and productivity.   As a   result, fixed   assets and   depreciation and   amortization expenses   are neither   maintained
nor available by operating segment.

Item 2.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis   of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
INTRODUCTION
This   Management’s   Discussion   and   Analysis   of   Financial   Condition   and   Results   of   Operations   (MD&A)   should   be   read   in
conjunction   with   the   MD&A   included   in   our   Annual   Report   on   Form   10-K   for   the   fiscal   year   ended   May   29,   2022   for   important
background   regarding,   among other   things, our   key business   drivers.   Significant   trademarks and   service marks   used in   our business
are set forth in
italics
herein. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in the   “Glossary” section below.
We expect   the largest factors impacting our   performance in fiscal 2023 will be   the economic health of consumers, the   inflationary cost
environment, and the frequency and   severity of disruptions in the supply   chain. We   anticipate double-digit input cost inflation   in fiscal
2023   and   are   addressing   inflation   headwinds   with   Holistic   Margin   Management   (HMM)   cost   savings   and   net   price   realization
generated   through   our   Strategic   Revenue   Management   (SRM)   capability.   We   are   planning   for   volume   elasticities   to   increase   but
remain below historical levels and supply chain disruptions to slowly moderate   in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 levels.
CONSOLIDATED   RESULTS   OF OPERATIONS
Third Quarter Results
In   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2023,   net   sales   increased   13 percent   and   organic   net   sales   increased   16   percent   compared   to   the   same
period last   year.   Operating profit   decreased 10   percent to   $730 million,   primarily driven   by higher   input costs,   an increase   in selling,
general   and   administrative   (SG&A)   expenses,   a   lower   net   gain   on   divestitures,   and   an   unfavorable   change   to   the   mark-to-market
valuation of   certain commodity   positions and   grain inventories,   partially offset   by favorable   net price   realization and   mix. Operating
profit margin of 14.2 percent decreased   380 basis points. Adjusted operating profit of   $807 million increased 20 percent on   a constant- currency   basis,   primarily   driven   by favorable   net price   realization   and   mix,   partially   offset   by higher   input   costs   and   an increase   in
SG&A   expenses.   Adjusted   operating   profit   margin   increased   80   basis   points   to   15.7   percent.   Diluted   earnings   per   share   of   $0.92
decreased   15   percent   in   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2023.   Adjusted   diluted   earnings   per   share   of   $0.97   increased   17 percent   on   a

Organic   net   sales   increased   16   percent   in   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2023   compared   to   the   same   period   in   fiscal   2022   driven   by
favorable organic net price realization and mix.
Cost of   sales
increased $327 million   to $3,461   million in the   third quarter   of fiscal 2023   compared to   the same   period in fiscal   2022.
The   increase   was primarily   driven   by   a   $290 million   increase   attributable   to   product   rate and   mix,   partially   offset   by   a   $10 million
decrease attributable   to lower volume.   We   recorded a $67   million net increase   in cost of   sales related to   the mark-to-market   valuation
of certain   commodity positions   and grain   inventories in   the third   quarter of   fiscal 2023   compared to   a $20 million   net increase   in the
third quarter of fiscal 2022.   Divestitures gain, net   totaled $14 million in   the third quarter of fiscal 2023,   compared to $170 million recorded   in the third quarter of
fiscal 2022.   In fiscal   2022,   we sold   our   interests in   Yoplait   SAS, Yoplait   Marques   SNC,   and   Liberté   Marques   Sàrl and   a European
dough business (please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in   Part I, Item 1 of this report).
SG&A   expenses
increased   $196   million   to   $947 million   in   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2023,   compared   to   the   same   period   in   fiscal
2022,   primarily   driven   by increased   media   and advertising   expenses,   an increase   in certain   compensation   and benefits   expenses,   an
increase   in   charitable   contributions,   and   unfavorable   valuation   adjustments   on   certain   corporate   investments   in   fiscal   2023.   SG&A
expenses as   a percent   of net   sales in   the third   quarter of   fiscal 2023   increased 190   basis points   compared to   the third   quarter of   fiscal
2022.
Restructuring, impairment,   and other exit   costs
totaled $1 million in   the third quarter   of fiscal 2023,   compared to $7 million   in the
same period last year (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial   Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).
Benefit plan   non-service income
totaled $22 million   in the   third quarter   of fiscal   2023, compared   to $27 million   in the   same period
last year,   primarily reflecting   an increase   in interest   costs, partially   offset by   lower amortization   of losses   and higher   expected return
on plan assets.   Interest,   net
for   the third   quarter   of fiscal   2023   totaled   $98 million,   up $12   million   from the   third   quarter of   fiscal   2022,   primarily
driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower   average long-term debt levels.
The
effective   tax   rate   for   the third   quarter   of fiscal   2023   was 16.6   percent   compared   to 16.3   percent   for   the   third   quarter   of fiscal
2022. The   0.3 percentage   point increase   was primarily   due to   certain unfavorable   nonrecurring discrete   tax items,   partially offset   by
favorable changes in   earnings mix by jurisdiction   in fiscal 2023. Our effective   tax rate excluding certain   items affecting comparability
was   21.6 percent   in   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2023,   compared   to   21.0   percent   in   the   same   period   last   year   (see   the   “Non-GAAP
Measures”   section   below   for   a   description   of   our   use   of   measures   not   defined   by   GAAP).   The   0.6   percentage   point   increase   was
primarily   due   to   certain   unfavorable   nonrecurring   discrete   tax   items,   partially   offset   by   favorable   changes   in   earnings   mix   by
jurisdiction in fiscal 2023.
23
After-tax earnings   from joint   ventures   for the   third quarter   of fiscal   2023 decreased to   $13 million compared   to $30   million in   the
same period   in fiscal   2022, primarily   driven by   higher input   costs and   unfavorable nonrecurring   discrete tax   items at   Cereal Partners
Worldwide   (CPW),   partially   offset   by   favorable   net   price   realization   and   mix   at   CPW.   On   a   constant-currency   basis,   after-tax
earnings   from   joint   ventures   decreased   51 percent   (see   the   “Non-GAAP   Measures”   section   below   for   a   description   of   our   use   of

Nine-Month Results
In the   nine-month period   ended February   26, 2023,   net sales   increased 7   percent compared   to the   same period   last year,   and organic
net sales increased 12   percent compared to the   same period last year.   Operating profit increased 6   percent to $2,616 million,   primarily
driven by favorable net price realization and   mix and a higher net gain on divestitures, partially   offset by higher input costs, a decrease
in   contributions   from   volume   growth,   an   unfavorable   change   to   the   mark-to-market   valuation   of   certain   commodity   positions   and
grain inventories, an increase in   SG&A expenses,   and lower net corporate investment   activity. Operating   profit margin of 17.4 percent
essentially matched the   same period last year.   Adjusted operating profit of   $2,568 million increased 11   percent on a constant-currency
basis,   primarily   driven   by   favorable   net   price   realization   and   mix,   partially   offset   by   higher   input   costs, a   decrease   in   contributions
from volume   growth, and   an increase in   SG&A expenses.   Adjusted operating   profit margin   increased   60 basis points   to 17.0   percent.
Diluted   earnings   per   share   of   $3.28   increased   7   percent   in   the   nine-month   period   ended   February   26,   2023,   and   adjusted   diluted

Organic   net   sales   increased   12   percent   in   the   nine-month   period   ended   February   26,   2023,   driven   by   favorable   organic   net   price
realization and mix, partially offset by a decrease in   contributions from organic volume growth.   Cost   of   sales   increased   $777 million   to   $10,247 million   in   the   nine-month   period   ended   February   26,   2023,   compared   to   the   same
period in   fiscal 2022.   The increase   was driven   by a   $1,229 million increase   attributable to   product rate   and mix,   partially offset   by a
$759   million   decrease due   to lower   volume.   We   recorded   a $266   million   net increase   in cost   of sales   related   to the   mark-to-market
valuation   of   certain   commodity   positions   and   grain   inventories   in   the   nine-month   period   ended   February   26,   2023,   compared   to   a
$16 million net   decrease in   the nine-month   period ended   February 27,   2022. In   the nine-month   period ended   February 26,   2023, we
recorded a $25 million charge related to a voluntary recall   on certain international
Häagen-Dazs   ice cream products.   SG&A expenses
increased $295 million   to $2,632 million   in the   nine-month period   ended February   26, 2023,   compared to   the same
period   in   fiscal   2022,   primarily   driven   by   unfavorable   valuation   adjustments   and   the   loss   on   sale   of   certain   corporate   investments,
increased   media   and   advertising   expenses,   an   increase   in   certain   compensation   and   benefits expenses,   and   an   increase   in   charitable
contributions   in   fiscal   2023.   SG&A   expenses   as   a   percent   of   net   sales   increased   90   basis   points   in   the   nine-month   period   ended
February 26, 2023, compared to the same period of fiscal 2022.
Divestitures   gain,   net   totaled   $445   million   in   the   nine-month   period   ended   February   26,   2023,   primarily   related   to   the sale   of   our
Helper main   meals and   Suddenly Salad   side dishes   business.   During the   nine-month period   ended February   27, 2022,   we recorded   a
$170 million divestitures gain related to the sale of our interest in Yoplait   SAS, Yoplait   Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl and a
European dough business (please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial   Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).
Restructuring, impairment,   and other   exit costs
totaled $14 million   in the   nine-month period   ended February   26, 2023,   compared
to   $5 million   in   the   same   period   last   year   (please   refer   to Note   3   to   the   Consolidated   Financial   Statements   in   Part   I,   Item   1   of   this
report).
Benefit plan non-service   income   totaled $65 million   in the nine-month   period ended   February 26,   2023, compared   to $84 million   in
the same   period last   year, primarily   reflecting an   increase in   interest costs,   partially offset   by lower   amortization of   losses and   higher
expected return on plan assets.
25
Interest, net   for the nine-month period ended February 26, 2023,   increased $2 million to $278 million compared to the same period   of
fiscal 2022.
The
effective   tax rate   for   the nine-month   period ended   February   26,   2023, was   19.6   percent compared   to 19.9   percent in   the nine- month   period   ended   February   27,   2022.   The   0.3   percentage   point   decrease   was   primarily   due   to   certain   nonrecurring   discrete   tax
benefits   and favorable   changes in   earnings   mix by   jurisdiction,   partially offset   by certain   unfavorable   tax components   related   to the
divestitures   incurred   in   the   nine-month   period   ended   February   26,   2023.   Our   effective   tax   rate   excluding   certain   items   affecting
comparability   was 20.8 percent   in the   nine-month period   ended February   26, 2023,   compared to   21.7 percent   in the   same period   last
year   (see   the   “Non-GAAP   Measures”   section   below   for   a   description   of   our   use   of   measures   not   defined   by   GAAP).   The   0.9
percentage   point   decrease   is   primarily   due   to   certain   nonrecurring   discrete   tax   benefits   and   favorable   changes   in   earnings   mix   by
jurisdiction in the nine-month period ended February 26, 2023.
After-tax earnings   from   joint ventures   decreased to   $58 million for   the nine-month   period ended   February 26,   2023, compared   to
$92 million   in the   same period   in fiscal   2022,   primarily   driven by   higher input   costs at   CPW and   HDJ and   lower net   sales at   HDJ,
partially offset by favorable net price realization   and mix at CPW.   On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from   joint ventures
decreased 28   percent (see the   “Non-GAAP Measures”   section below   for a description   of our use   of measures   not defined   by GAAP).

International   organic   net   sales increased   8   percent   in   the   third   quarter   of   fiscal   2023   and 3   percent   in   the   nine-month   period   ended
February 26,   2023, compared   to the   same periods   in fiscal   2022, driven   by favorable   organic net   price realization   and mix,   partially
offset by a decrease in contributions from organic   volume growth.
Segment operating   profit increased   18 percent   to $42 million   in the   third quarter   of fiscal   2023,   compared to   $36 million in   the same
period in fiscal 2022, primarily driven   by favorable net price realization   and mix and a decrease in SG&A expenses,   partially offset by
higher   input   costs   and   a   decrease   in   contributions   from   volume   growth,   including   the   impact   of volume   declines   from   divestitures.
Segment operating   profit increased   27 percent   on a   constant-currency basis   in the   third quarter   of fiscal   2023 compared   to the   same

$156 million   in   the   same   period   in   fiscal   2022,   primarily   driven   by   a   decrease   in   contributions   from   volume   growth,   including   the
impact   of   volume declines   from   divestitures   and   the voluntary   recall   on certain   international
Häagen-Dazs   ice   cream   products,   and
higher   input costs,   partially   offset   by favorable   net price   realization and   mix and   a decrease   in SG&A   expenses.   Segment operating

Crust   in   the   third   quarter   of fiscal   2023,   compared   to $4 million   of   integration   costs related   to   our   acquisition   of   Tyson   Foods’   pet
treats business in the third   quarter of fiscal 2022. In   the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we   recorded $9 million of transaction costs related
to   the   sale   of   our   interests   in   Yoplait   SAS,   Yoplait   Marques   SNC,   and   Liberté   Marques   Sàrl   and   the   sale   of   our   European   dough

During the   nine-month period   ended February   26, 2023,   cash provided by   operations was   $2,027 million   compared to   $2,228 million
in the   same period   last year.   The $201   million decrease   was primarily   driven by   an increase in   inventory and   higher cash   income tax
payments in the nine-month period ended February 26, 2023, as compared   to the same period a year ago.
Cash used   by investing   activities   during   the nine   -month   period ended   February   26, 2023,   was $6   million   compared   to cash   used of
$1,462 million for the same period   in fiscal 2022. During the first quarter   of the 2023, we completed the sale of   the Helper main meals
and Suddenly   Salad side dishes   business   for   $607   million cash.   In the   first   quarter   of fiscal   2023,   we   acquired   TNT Crust   for   $252
million cash, net of cash acquired.   In the first quarter of fiscal 2022,   we acquired the Tyson   Foods’ pet treats business for an   aggregate
purchase price of $1.2 billion.   Cash   used   by   financing   activities   during   the   nine-month   period   ended   February   26,   2023,   was   $1,956 million   compared   to
$1,398 million of   cash used   by financing   activities in   the same   period in   fiscal 2022.   We   paid $967   million of   dividends in   the nine- month period ended February 26, 202   3, compared to $934 million in the   same period last year.   We purchased   $1,152 million of shares
of common   stock in the   nine-month period   ended February 26,   2023, compared   to $550 million   in the same   period in fiscal   2022.   In
addition, we had $61 million of net debt issuances in the   nine-month period ended February 26, 2023, compared   to $128 million of net
debt issuances in the same period a year ago.
As   of   February   26,   2023,   we   had   $553 million   of   cash   and   cash   equivalents   in   foreign   jurisdictions.   In   anticipation   of   repatriating
funds from   foreign jurisdictions,   we record   local country   withholding taxes   on our   international earnings,   as applicable.   Furthermore,
we   may   repatriate   our   cash   and   cash   equivalents   held   by   our   foreign   subsidiaries   without   such   funds   being   subject   to   further   U.S.
income tax liability.   Earnings prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently   reinvested in those jurisdictions.

The   third-party   holder   of   the   General   Mills   Cereals,   LLC   (GMC)   Class A   Interests   receives   quarterly   preferred   distributions   from
available net   income based   on the application   of a   floating preferred   return rate   to the   holder’s capital   account balance   established in
the most   recent mark   -to-market valuation   (currently   $252 million).   The floating   preferred return   rate on   GMC’s   Class A Interests   is
the   sum   of   the   three-month   Term   SOFR   plus   186   basis   points.   The   preferred   return   rate   is   adjusted   every   three   years   through   a
negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through   a remarketing auction.   We   have an option   to purchase the   Class A Interests for   consideration equal to   the then current   capital account value,   plus any unpaid
preferred return   and the   prescribed make-whole   amount. If   we purchase   these interests,   any change   in the   third-party holder’s   capital
account   from   its   original   value   will   be   charged   directly   to   retained   earnings   and   will   increase   or   decrease   the   net   earnings   used   to
calculate EPS in that period.   To ensure availability   of funds, we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs   available to us in the United States
and Europe.   Certain   of   our   long-term   debt   agreements,   our   credit   facilities,   and   our   noncontrolling   interests   contain   restrictive   covenants.   As   of
February 26, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.   We   have $2,487 million   of long-term debt   maturing in the   next 12 months   that is classified   as current, including   €500 million of   1.00
percent fixed-rate notes due   April 27, 2023, €250   million of 0.00 percent   fixed-rate notes due May   16, 2023, €250 million   of floating- rate notes due   May 16, 2023,   €500 million   of 0.00 percent   fixed-rate notes   due July 27,   2023, and $400   million of   floating-rate notes
due October 17, 2023. We   believe that cash flows from operations, together with   available short-   and long-term debt financing, will be
adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2   to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in   our Annual Report on
Form   10-K for   the fiscal   year ended   May 29,   2022. The   accounting policies   used in   preparing our   interim fiscal   2023
Consolidated
Financial Statements are the same as those described in our Form 10-K. Our   critical   accounting   estimates   are   those   that   have   meaningful   impact   on   the   reporting   of   our   financial   condition   and   results   of
operations.   These   estimates   include   our   accounting   for   revenue   recognition,   valuation   of   long-lived   assets,   intangible   assets,   stock- based compensation,   income taxes,   and defined   benefit pension,   other postretirement   benefit, and   postemployment benefit   plans. The
assumptions and methodologies   used in the   determination of   those estimates as   of February 26,   2023, are the   same as those   described
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022.
Our   annual   goodwill   and   indefinite-lived   intangible   assets   impairment   test   was   performed   on   the   first   day   of   the   second   quarter   of
fiscal   2023,   and   we   determined   there   was   no   impairment   of   our   intangible   assets   as   their   related   fair   values   were   substantially   in
excess of the   carrying values,   except for   the
Uncle Toby’s   brand intangible   asset. In addition,   while having   significant coverage   as of
our fiscal 2023   assessment date, the
Progresso   and
EPIC
brand intangible assets had   risk of decreasing coverage.   We   will continue to
monitor these businesses for potential impairment.
RECENTLY   ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In   December   2022,   the   Financial   Accounting   Standards   Board   (FASB)   issued   optional   accounting   guidance   for   a   limited   period   of
time   to   ease   the   potential   burden   in   accounting   for   reference   rate   reform.   The   new   standard   provides   expedients   and   exceptions   to
existing accounting requirements   for contract modifications and   hedge accounting related to   transitioning from discontinued   reference
rates,   such   as   LIBOR,   to   alternative   reference   rates,   if   certain   criteria   are   met.   The   new   accounting   requirements   can   be   applied
through December 31, 2024. We   are in the process of reviewing our contracts and arrangements   that will be affected by a discontinued
reference rate and are analyzing the impact of this guidance on our results of operations   and financial position.
In September 2022,   the FASB   issued Accounting Standards   Update (ASU) 2022-04   requiring enhanced disclosures   related to supplier
financing programs.   The ASU   requires disclosure   of the   key terms   of the   program and   a rollforward   of the   related obligation   during
32
the annual period,   including the amount of   obligations confirmed and   obligations subsequently paid.   The new disclosure requirements
are effective   for fiscal years beginning   after December 15, 2022,   with the exception   of the rollforward requirement,   which is effective
for fiscal years beginning   after December 15,   2023, which for us   is the first quarter   of fiscal 2024 for   the primary requirement   and the
first quarter   of fiscal   2025 for   the rollforward   requirement. Early   adoption is   permitted. We   have historically   presented the   key terms
of these   programs   and the   associated obligation   outstanding.   We   do not   expect this   ASU to   have a   material   impact on   our financial
statements and related disclosures.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
We   have   included   in   this   report   measures   of   financial   performance   that   are not   defined   by   GAAP.   We   believe   that   these   measures
provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other   communications to investors.   For each   of these   non-GAAP financial   measures, we   are providing   below a   reconciliation of   the differences   between the   non-GAAP
measure and the most   directly comparable GAAP measure,   an explanation of why   we believe the non-GAAP   measure provides useful
information to   investors, and   any additional   material purposes   for which   our management   or Board   of Directors   uses the   non-GAAP
measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not   in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.
Significant Items Impacting Comparability
Several   measures   below   are   presented   on   an   adjusted   basis.   The   adjustments   are   either   items   resulting   from   infrequently   occurring
events or items that, in management’s   judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year   assessment of operating results.
The following are descriptions of significant items impacting comparability   of our results.
Divestitures   gain, net
Net divestitures   gain primarily   related to   the sale   of our   Helper main   meals and   Suddenly Salad   side dishes   business in   fiscal 2023.
Divestitures gain related   to the sale of our   interests in Yoplait   SAS, Yoplait   Marques SNC, and Liberté   Marques Sàrl and the   sale of a
European dough business in fiscal 2022. Please see Note 2 to the Consolidated   Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
Mark-to-market effects
Net   mark-to-market   valuation   of   certain   commodity   positions   recognized   in   unallocated   corporate   items.   Please   see   Note   6   to   the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
Investment activity,   net
Valuation   adjustments and the   loss on sale of   certain corporate investments   in fiscal 2023.   Valuation   adjustments and the   gain on sale
of certain corporate investments in fiscal 2022.
Product recall
Voluntary   recall costs recorded in fiscal 2023 related to certain international
Häagen-Dazs   ice cream products.
Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges   for previously announced   restructuring actions recorded   in fiscal 2023   and fiscal 2022.   Please see Note 3   to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
Acquisition integration costs
Integration costs   primarily resulting   from the acquisition   of TNT Crust   in fiscal 2023.   Integration costs   resulting from   the acquisition
of Tyson   Foods’ pet treats business   in fiscal 2022.   Please see Note   2 to the   Consolidated Financial Statements   in Part I,   Item 1 of   this
report.
Transaction costs
Transaction   costs   primarily   related   to   the   sale   of   our   Helper   main   meals   and   Suddenly   Salad   side   dishes   business   in   fiscal   2023.
Transaction   costs related   to the sale   of our   interests in   Yoplait   SAS, Yoplait   Marques SNC,   and Liberté   Marques Sàrl   and the sale   of
our   European   dough   businesses in   fiscal   2022.   Please see   Note   2   to   the   Consolidated   Financial   Statements   in   Part   I,   Item   1   of   this
report.
Non-income tax recovery
Recovery related to a Brazil indirect tax item recorded in fiscal 2022.

Organic Net Sales Growth Rates
We   provide organic   net sales   growth rates   for our   consolidated net   sales and   segment net   sales. This   measure is   used in   reporting to
our   Board   of   Directors   and   executive   management   and   as   a   component   of   the   measurement   of   our   performance   for   incentive
compensation purposes.   We   believe that   organic net   sales growth   rates provide   useful information   to investors   because they   provide
transparency   to   underlying   performance   in   our   net   sales   by   excluding   the   effect   that   foreign   currency   exchange   rate   fluctuations,
acquisitions, divestitures,   and a 53 rd   week, when applicable,   have on year-to-year comparability.   A reconciliation of   these measures to
reported net   sales growth   rates, the   relevant GAAP   measures, are   included in   our Consolidated   Results of   Operations and   Results of
Segment Operations   discussions in the MD&A above.
Adjusted Operating Profit as a Percent of Net Sales (Adjusted Operating Profit   Margin)
We believe   this measure provides useful information   to investors because it is important   for assessing our operating profit margin   on a
comparable basis.
Our adjusted operating profit margins are calculated as follows:

Adjusted Operating Profit Growth on a Constant-currency Basis
This measure is used in reporting   to our Board of Directors and   executive management and as a   component of the measurement of   our
performance for   incentive compensation purposes.   We   believe that   this measure provides   useful information   to investors because   it is
the   operating   profit   measure   we   use   to   evaluate   operating   profit   performance   on   a   comparable   year-to-year   basis.   The   measure   is
evaluated on   a constant-currency   basis by   excluding the   effect that   foreign currency   exchange rate   fluctuations have   on year-to-year
comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.   Our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated   as follows:

Glossary
AOCI . Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Adjusted diluted EPS.   Diluted EPS adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year   comparability.
Adjusted operating profit.   Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year   comparability.
Adjusted operating profit   margin.
Operating profit adjusted   for certain items   affecting year-over-year   comparability,   divided by net
sales.
Constant currency.   Financial results   translated to   United States   dollars using   constant foreign   currency exchange   rates based   on the
rates   in   effect   for   the   comparable   prior-year   period.   To   present   this   information,   current   period   results   for   entities   reporting   in
currencies other   than United   States dollars   are translated   into United   States dollars   at the   average exchange   rates in   effect during   the
corresponding   period   of   the   prior   fiscal   year,   rather   than   the   actual   average   exchange   rates   in   effect   during   the   current   fiscal   year.
Therefore,   the   foreign   currency   impact   is   equal   to   current   year   results   in   local   currencies   multiplied   by   the   change   in   the   average
foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding   period of the prior fiscal year.   Core working capital.   Accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable.
Derivatives.
Financial instruments such   as futures, swaps,   options, and forward   contracts that we   use to manage   our risk arising   from
changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and stock   prices.
Euribor.   Euro Interbank Offered Rate.
Fair value   hierarchy.
For purposes   of fair   value measurement,   we categorize   assets and   liabilities into   one of   three levels   based on
the assumptions   (inputs) used   in valuing   the asset or   liability.   Level 1 provides   the most reliable   measure of   fair value, while   Level 3
generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels   are defined as follows:   Level 1:   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:   Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in   Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
Level 3:   Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s   assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
Free cash flow.   Net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of land, buildings, and equipment.
Generally Accepted   Accounting Principles   (GAAP).
Guidelines, procedures,   and practices   that we   are required   to use in   recording
and reporting accounting information in our financial statements.
Goodwill.
The difference   between the purchase   price of acquired   companies plus the fair   value of any noncontrolling   and redeemable
interests and the related fair values of net assets acquired.   Gross margin.   Net sales less cost of sales.
Hedge accounting.
Accounting for qualifying   hedges that allows changes in   a hedging instrument’s   fair value to offset   corresponding
changes in   the hedged   item in   the same   reporting period.   Hedge accounting   is permitted   for certain   hedging instruments   and hedged
items   only   if   the   hedging   relationship   is   highly   effective,   and   only   prospectively   from   the   date   a   hedging   relationship   is   formally
documented.
Holistic Margin Management   (HMM).   Company-wide initiative to   use productivity savings, mix   management, and price realization
to offset input cost inflation, protect margins,   and generate funds to reinvest in sales-generating activities.
Interest   bearing   instruments.
Notes   payable,   long-term   debt,   including   current   portion,   cash   and   cash   equivalents,   and   certain
interest bearing investments classified within prepaid expenses and other current   assets and other assets.
LIBOR.
London Interbank Offered Rate.   Mark-to-market.
The act of determining a value for   financial instruments, commodity contracts, and   related assets or liabilities based
on the current market price for that item.
38
Net   mark-to-market   valuation of   certain   commodity   positions.
Realized   and   unrealized   gains   and   losses on   derivative   contracts
that will be allocated to segment operating profit when the exposure we   are hedging affects earnings.
Net price realization.
The impact of list and promoted price changes, net of trade and other price   promotion costs.
Net realizable   value.
The estimated   selling price   in the   ordinary course   of business,   less reasonably   predictable costs   of completion,
disposal, and transportation.   Noncontrolling interests.
Interests of subsidiaries held by third parties.   Notional   amount.
The   amount   of   a   position   or   an   agreed   upon   amount   in   a   derivative   contract   on   which   the   value   of   financial
instruments are calculated.
OCI.
Other Comprehensive Income.   Organic net sales growth . Net sales growth adjusted   for foreign currency translation,   acquisitions, divestitures and a   53 rd   fiscal week,
when applicable.
Project-related costs.
Costs incurred related to our restructuring initiatives not included in restructuring   charges.
Redeemable interest.
Interest of subsidiaries held by a third party   that can be redeemed outside of our   control and therefore cannot be
classified as a noncontrolling interest in equity.
Reporting unit . An operating segment or a business one level below an operating   segment.
SOFR.   Secured Overnight Financing Rate.
Strategic   Revenue   Management   (SRM).   A   company-wide   capability   focused   on   generating   sustainable   benefits   from   net   price
realization   and   mix   by   identifying   and   executing   against   specific   opportunities   to   apply   tools   including   pricing,   sizing,   mix
management, and promotion optimization across each of our businesses.
Supply chain   input costs.   Costs incurred   to produce   and deliver   product,   including costs   for   ingredients   and   conversion, inventory
management, logistics, and warehousing.
Translation   adjustments.
The impact   of the conversion   of our foreign   affiliates’ financial   statements to United   States dollars   for the
purpose of consolidating our financial statements.
Variable   interest   entities (VIEs).   A legal   structure   that is   used for   business purposes   that either   (1) does   not have   equity investors
that have voting   rights and share in   all the entity’s   profits and losses or   (2) has equity   investors that do not   provide sufficient financial
resources to support the entity’s activities.
Working capital . Current assets and current liabilities, all as of the last day of our fiscal year.

Reform Act   of 1995   that are   based on   our current   expectations and   assumptions. We   also may   make written   or oral   forward-looking
statements,   including   statements   contained   in   our   filings   with   the   Securities   and   Exchange   Commission   and   in   our   reports   to
stockholders.
The words or   phrases “will likely   result,” “are expected   to,” “will continue,”   “is anticipated,” “estimate,”   “plan,” “project,” or   similar
expressions identify   “forward-looking statements”   within the   meaning of   the Private   Securities Litigation   Reform Act   of 1995.   Such

those currently anticipated or projected. We   caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.
In connection   with the “safe   harbor” provisions   of the Private   Securities Litigation   Reform Act of   1995, we are   identifying important
factors   that could   affect   our financial   performance   and could   cause our   actual results   in future   periods   to differ   materially   from any
current opinions or statements.
Our future results could   be affected by a   variety of factors, such   as: the impact of the   COVID-19 pandemic on   our business, suppliers,
consumers,   customers,   and   employees;   disruptions   or   inefficiencies   in   the   supply   chain,   including   any   impact   of   the   COVID-19
pandemic;   competitive   dynamics   in   the   consumer   foods   industry   and   the   markets   for   our   products,   including   new   product
introductions,   advertising   activities,   pricing   actions,   and   promotional   activities   of   our   competitors;   economic   conditions,   including
changes   in   inflation   rates,   interest   rates,   tax   rates,   or   the   availability   of   capital;   product   development   and   innovation;   consumer

acquisitions   or   dispositions   of   businesses   or   assets;   changes   in   capital   structure;   changes   in   the   legal   and   regulatory   environment,
including   tax   legislation,   labeling   and   advertising   regulations,   and   litigation;   impairments   in   the   carrying   value   of   goodwill,   other
intangible assets,   or other   long-lived assets,   or changes   in the   useful lives   of other   intangible assets;   changes in   accounting standards
and   the impact   of critical   accounting   estimates; product   quality and   safety issues,   including   recalls and   product   liability; changes   in
consumer   demand   for   our   products;   effectiveness   of   advertising,   marketing,   and   promotional   programs;   changes   in   consumer
behavior,   trends,   and   preferences,   including   weight   loss   trends;   consumer   perception   of   health-related   issues,   including   obesity;
consolidation   in the   retail environment;   changes in   purchasing and   inventory levels   of significant   customers; fluctuations   in the   cost
and   availability   of   supply   chain   resources,   including   raw   materials,   packaging,   energy,   and   transportation;   effectiveness   of
restructuring   and   cost   saving   initiatives;   volatility   in   the   market   value   of   derivatives   used   to   manage   price   risk   for   certain
commodities; benefit plan   expenses due to   changes in plan   asset values and discount   rates used to   determine plan liabilities;   failure or
breach of   our information   technology systems;   foreign economic   conditions, including   currency rate   fluctuations; and   political unrest
in foreign markets and economic uncertainty due to terrorism or war.
You   should also   consider the risk   factors that we   identify in Item   1A of Part   I of our   Annual Report on   Form 10-K for   the fiscal year
ended May 29, 2022 which could also affect our future results.
We undertake   no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking   statements to reflect events or circumstances   after the date of those
statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures.   We,   under the   supervision and   with the   participation of   our management,   including our   Chief Executive   Officer and   Chief Financial
Officer,   have   evaluated   the   effectiveness   of   the design   and   operation   of   our   disclosure   controls   and   procedures   (as   defined   in   Rule
13a-15(e)   under   the   Securities   Exchange   Act   of   1934).   Based   on   our   evaluation,   our   Chief   Executive   Officer   and   Chief   Financial
Officer have concluded   that, as of February   26, 2023, our disclosure   controls and procedures were   effective to ensure   that information
required to   be disclosed   by us   in reports   that we file   or submit   under the   Securities Exchange   Act of   1934 is (1)   recorded, processed,
summarized,   and   reported   within   the   time   periods   specified   in   Securities   and   Exchange   Commission   rules   and   forms,   and   (2)
accumulated and   communicated to   our management,   including our   Chief Executive   Officer and   Chief Financial   Officer,   in a   manner
that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There were no changes in our internal   control over financial reporting (as defined   in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange   Act
of 1934) during   the quarter ended February   26, 2023 that materially   affected, or are   reasonably likely to   materially affect, our   internal
control over financial reporting.
