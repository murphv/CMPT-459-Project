AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Donaldson Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting prin ciples (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.) and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of earnings, comprehensive income, financial position, cash flows and changes in stockholders’ equity have been included and a re of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future periods. The year-end Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet information was derived from the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. For further information, refer to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. As discussed in Note 18, effective November 1, 2022, the Company established a new segment reporting structure which resulted in three reportable segments: Mobile Solutions, Industrial Solutions and Life Sciences. Principles of Consolidation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all its majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company’s joint ventures are not majority-owned and are accounted for under the equity method. Certain reclassifications to previously reported financial information on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity have been made to conform to the current period presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities at period end and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating Environment Inflation While inflation was not as significant in the second quarter or the first six months of fiscal 2023, as compared to the prior year, the Company continues to experience the effects of inflation related to raw materials and other expenses, including labor and energy. These inflationary pressures have had an adverse impact on the Company’s profit margins throughout the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2023, however they have been generally mitigated by pricing actions implemented in the prior year. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company considers the applicability and impact of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued but not yet adopted. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805),
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.
This ASU clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with ASU 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) as if the entity had originated the contracts. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early application permitted. This ASU is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements. 7 In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820),
Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,
which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair values; it also requires additional disclosures, including the nature and remaining duration of such restrictions. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early application permitted. This ASU is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements. Note 2. Acquisitions In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company acquired Pearson Arnold Industrial Services (PAIS), headquartered in New Hope, Minnesota, for cash consideration of $ 3.3  million, net of cash acquired, and contingent consideration with a maximum payout of $ 1.7  million, and Solaris Biotechnology S.r.l (Solaris), headquartered in Mantovano, Italy, with U.S. operations based in Berkeley, California, for cash consideration of
€ 41  million, or $ 45.7  million, net of cash acquired.
PAIS provides equipment, parts and services for dust, mist and fume collection systems, industrial fans and compressed air systems. PAIS is reported within the Company’s Industrial Filtration Solutions (IFS) business in the Industrial Solutions segment. So laris designs and manufactures bioprocessing equipment, including bioreactors, fermenters and tangential flow filtration systems for use in food and beverage, biotec hnology and other life sciences markets. Solaris is reported within the Company’s Life Sciences segment. Net sales of these acquisitions were immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company acquired Purilogics LLC (Purilogics) headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, for cash consideration of $ 19.9  million, net of cash acquired, and contingent consideration with a maximum payout of
$ 29.0  million.
Purilogics is a biotechnology company that leverages a novel technology platform for the development of membrane chromatography products. Purilogics offers a broad portfolio of purification tools for a wide range of biologics. Purilogics’ proprietary formulations and processes create membranes that have significant competitive advantages, enabling faster and more cost-effective production of increasingly complex biologic drugs. Purilogics is reported within the Company’s Life Sciences segment. Purchase accounting was finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Net sales of Purilogics were immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023. See Notes 15 and 17 for related contingent compensation and consideration. Purchase Price Summary The components of acquisitions, net of cash acquired, as of each acquisition date (in millions): Intangible assets: Technology $ 45.9   Trademarks and tradenames 4.0   Customer relationships 3.0   Non-competition agreements 0.6   Backlog 0.2   Intangible assets acquired 53.7   Tangible liabilities, net ( 2.7 ) Assets acquired, net 51.0   Goodwill 42.8   Aggregate purchase price 93.8   Less contingent consideration ( 24.6 ) Less cash acquired ( 0.3 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ 68.9   Note 3. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue on a wide range of filtration solutions sold to customers in many industries around the globe. Most of the Company’s performance obligations within customer sales contracts are for manufactured filtration systems and replacement parts. The Company also performs limited services and installation. Customer contracts may include multiple performance obligations and the transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. 8 Revenue Disaggregation Net sales, generally disaggregated by location where the customer’s order was placed, were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended January 31, Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 U.S. and Canada $ 346.4   $ 314.0   $ 721.7   $ 614.8   Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 252.1   241.7   478.8   466.3   Asia Pacific (APAC) 142.4   170.2   293.0   334.0   Latin America (LATAM) 87.4   76.6   182.1   148.3   Total net sales $ 828.3   $ 802.5   $ 1,675.6   $ 1,563.4   See Note 18 for net sales disaggregated by segment and business unit. Contract Assets and Liabilities The satisfaction of performance obligations and the resulting recognition of revenue typically correspond with billing of the customer. In limited circumstances, the customer may be billed at a time later than when revenue is recognized, resulting in contract assets, which are reported in other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract assets were $ 17.7  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022. In other limited circumstances, the customer may make a payment at a time earlier than when revenue is recognized and prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations, resulting in contract liabilities, which are reported in deferred revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities were $ 30.9  million and $ 22.3  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.
The Company will recognize revenue in future periods related to remaining performance obligations for certain open contracts. Generally, these contracts have terms of one year or less. The amount of revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations in which the original duration of the contract is greater than one year is not significant. None of the Company’s contracts contained a significant financing component. Note 4. Inventories, Net The components of inventories, net were as follows (in millions): January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 Raw materials $ 190.3   $ 197.6   Work in process 59.6   56.1   Finished products 251.4   248.7   Total inventories, net $ 501.3   $ 502.4   Note 5. Property, Plant and Equipment, Net The components of property, plant and equipment, net were as follows (in millions): January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 Land $ 26.2   $ 25.6   Buildings 407.9   396.2   Machinery and equipment 974.2   940.1   Computer software 141.5   141.0   Construction in progress 110.6   72.1   Less accumulated depreciation ( 1,034.6 ) ( 980.6 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 625.8   $ 594.4   9 Note 6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units within its Mobile Solutions, Industrial Solutions and Life Sciences segments. There were no dispositions or impairment charges recorded during the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually during the third quarter of the fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and did not record any impairment as a result of this assessment. As a result of the organization redesign, the Company performed a qualitative impairment assessment based on the new segments in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and concluded there was no impairment. Goodwill by reportable segment was as follows (in millions): Mobile Solutions Industrial Solutions Life Sciences Total Balance as of July 31, 2022 (1) $ 25.3   $ 282.1   $ 38.4   $ 345.8   Foreign currency translation —   2.9   1.5   4.4   Balance as of January 31, 2023 $ 25.3   $ 285.0   $ 39.9   $ 350.2   (1) All prior segment information has been recast to reflect the Company’s new segment structure and current period presentation (see Note 18). Intangible Assets Intangible asset classes were as follows (in millions): Customer Relationships Patents, Trademarks and Technology Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Total Net Value Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Total Net Value Total Balance as of July 31, 2022 $ 104.6   $ ( 60.3 ) $ 44.3   $ 71.9   $ ( 16.4 ) $ 55.5   $ 99.8   Amortization expense —   ( 2.6 ) ( 2.6 ) —   ( 2.5 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 5.1 ) Foreign currency translation 0.5   0.2   0.7   1.1   ( 0.1 ) 1.0   1.7   Balance as of January 31, 2023 $ 105.1   $ ( 62.7 ) $ 42.4   $ 73.0   $ ( 19.0 ) $ 54.0   $ 96.4   Amortization expense was $ 2.5  million and $ 5.1  million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, and was $ 2.4  million and $ 4.5  million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, respectively. Amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Note 7. Long-Term Debt As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 392.5  million available and $ 100.0  million outstanding on the Company’s $ 500.0
million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on May 21, 2026. Certain debt agreements contain financial covenants related to interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of January 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. Note 8. Income Taxes
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed examinations of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns through fiscal 2018. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2017. As of January 31, 2023, gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 16.2  million and accrued interest and penalties on these unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1.6  million. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company estimates within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible its uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as $ 3.2  million due to lapses in statutes of limitation. The statutes of limitation periods for the Company’s various tax jurisdictions range from two years to 10 years. 10 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into U.S. law. Under this law, there is a new 15% corporate minimum tax, which is not expected to have an impact on the Company. In addition, beginning January 1, 2023, a 1% excise tax was imposed on the net value of certain share repurchases, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company evaluated the other aspects within this new law and does not expect a material impact to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes it is remote that any adjustment necessary to the reserve for income taxes over the next 12 months will be material. However, it is possible the ultimate resolution of audits or disputes may result in a material change to the reserve for income taxes, although the quantification of such potential adjustments cannot be made at this time. Note 9. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares. Diluted net EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and common share equivalents relating to stock options and other stock incentive plans. Basic and diluted net EPS calculations were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Three Months Ended January 31, Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 86.0   $ 71.8   $ 173.2   $ 148.8   Weighted average common shares outstanding Weighted average common shares – basic 121.7   123.9   122.2   124.1   Dilutive impact of stock-based awards 1.6   1.7   1.5   1.9   Weighted average common shares – diluted 123.3   125.6   123.7   126.0   Net EPS – basic $ 0.71   $ 0.58   $ 1.42   $ 1.20   Net EPS – diluted $ 0.70   $ 0.57   $ 1.40   $ 1.18   Stock options excluded from net EPS calculation —   1.6   1.6   —   Note 10. Stockholders’ Equity Share Repurchases The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to
13.0  million shares of common stock under the Company’s stock repurchase plan. This repurchase authorization is effective until terminated by the Board of Directors. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company repurchased
2.1  million shares for $ 115.2  million. During the six months ended January 31, 2022, the Company repurchased

(2) Relates to designated foreign currency forward contracts that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to net sales, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings, see Note 14.
(3) In fiscal 2022, pension settlement accounting was triggered. Remeasurements of the Company’s pension obligations resulted in an increase of $ 1.7  million to accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, see Note 13. Note 12. Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the award. Stock-based awards consist primarily of non-qualified stock options, performance-based awards, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. Grants related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are immaterial.
The Company issues treasury shares for stock options and performance-based awards. Stock Options The exercise price of options granted is equal to
the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of the grant. Options are generally exercisable
for up to
10
years from the date of grant and vest in equal increments over
three years . Pretax stock-based compensation expense associated with options was $ 1.8  million and $ 9.3  million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, and was $ 1.9  million and $ 8.8  million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, respectively. 13 Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted average fair value for options granted was $ 15.62
and $ 14.27
per share during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Option activity was as follows: Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Balance outstanding as of July 31, 2022 6,927,161   $ 46.32   Granted 911,900   51.21   Exercised ( 676,039 ) 39.18   Expired/forfeited ( 52,589 ) 53.56   Balance outstanding as of January 31, 2023 7,110,433   $ 47.57   Performance-Based Awards Performance-based awards are payable in common stock and are based on a formula that measures Company performance over a
three year
period. These awards are settled after
three years
with payouts ranging from
0 % to
200 % of the target award depending on achievement.
Pretax performance-based awards expense was $ 1.7  million and $ 3.5  million for the three and six mo nths ended January 31, 2023
and was $ 2.1  million and $ 3.8  million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, respectively. Performance-based awards for non-vested activity were as follows: Performance Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Balance outstanding as of July 31, 2022 188,206   $ 52.20   Granted 113,100   50.89   Vested —   —   Forfeited ( 7,692 ) 54.76   Balance outstanding as of January 31, 2023 293,614   $ 51.63   Note 13. Employee Benefit Plans The Company has defined benefit pension plans for certain hourly and salaried employees.
They consist of plans in the U.S., Belgium, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom.
These plans generally provide pension benefits based on years of service and compensation level. Components of net periodic pension costs other than the service cost component are included in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Net periodic pension costs for the Company’s pension plans were as follows (in millions):   Three Months Ended January 31, Six Months Ended January 31,   2023 2022 2023 2022 Service cost $ 1.6   $ 1.8   $ 3.2   $ 3.6   Interest cost 4.2   2.5   8.3   5.0   Expected return on assets ( 6.4 ) ( 6.2 ) ( 12.7 ) ( 12.5 ) Prior service cost amortization 0.1   —   0.1   0.1   Actuarial loss amortization 0.5   1.8   1.1   3.6   Settlement charge —   1.2   —   1.2   Net periodic pension costs $ —   $ 1.1   $ —   $ 1.0   In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $ 1.2  million as a result of lump sum distributions exceeding the service and interest cost components of the annual net periodic pension cost. The corresponding remeasurement resulted in a decrease in the Company’s pension assets and a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive loss in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income of
$ 1.7  million . See Note 11. 14 The Company’s general funding policy is to make at least the minimum required contributions as required by applicable regulations, plus any additional amounts it determines to be appropriate. Future required pension plan contributions may change significantly depending on the actual rate of return on plan assets, discount rates and regulatory requirements. Note 14. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Derivative Fair Value Measurements
The Company enters into derivative instrument agreements, including foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges, to manage risk in connection with changes in foreign currency. The Company only enters into derivative instrument agreements with counterparties who have highly rated credit. There is risk the counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. In order to mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other financial factors.
Contract provisions may require the posting of collateral or settlement of the contracts for various reasons, including if the Company’s credit ratings are downgraded below its investment grade credit rating by any of the major credit agencies or for cross default contractual provisions if there is a failure under other financing arrangements related to payment terms or covenants. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, no collateral was posted. The Company does not enter into derivative instrument agreements for trading or speculative purposes. For discussion on the fair value of the Company’s derivatives, see Note 15. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts - Cash Flow Hedges and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The Company buys materials from foreign suppliers. Those transactions can be denominated in those suppliers’ local currency. The Company also sells to customers in foreign countries. Those transactions can be denominated in those customers’ local currency. Both of these transaction types can create volatility in the Company’s financial statements. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage those exposures and fluctuations. These contracts generally mature in
12
months or less, which is consistent with the forecasts of the related purchases and sales. Certain contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, whereas the remaining contracts, most of which are related to certain intercompany transactions which offset balance sheet exposure, are not designated as hedging instruments. The total notional amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges were
$ 77.2  million
and $ 158.0  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. The total notional amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges were $ 207.9  million and $ 151.6  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the Company’s designated hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets until the related transaction occurs, see Note 11. Designated hedges are recognized as a component of either net sales, cost of sales,
selling, general and administrative
expenses or
other income, net
in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings upon occurrence of the related hedged transaction. Hedges which are not designated are recognized in
other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings along with the related hedged transactions. Changes in the fair value of hedges which are not designated, are recognized in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Amounts related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months based upon the timing of inventory purchases and sales. Net Investment Hedges The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap agreements to hedge its exposure to adverse foreign currency exchange rate
movements for i ts operations in Europe. The Company has elected the spot method for designating these contracts as net investment hedges. The total notional amount of net investment hedges was € 80  million, or $ 88.8  million, as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022. The maturity dates range from 2027 to 2029. Gains and losses resulting from a change in fair value of the net investment hedge are offset by gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency exposure and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts related to excluded components associated with the net investment hedge are expected to be reclassified into earnings in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings through their maturity. Cash Flows Cash flows from derivative transactions are recorded in operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 15 Note 15. Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements of financial instruments are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used. For Level 1, inputs to the fair value measurement are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. For Level 2, inputs to the fair value measurement include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. For Level 3,
inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs or are based on valuation techniques.
Short-Term Financial Instruments As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Short-term financial instruments are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Long-Term Debt As of January 31, 2023, the estimated fair values of fixed interest rate long-term debt were $ 386.4  million compared to the carrying values of $ 425.0  million. As of July 31, 2022, the estimated fair values of fixed interest rate long-term debt were $ 396.9  million compared to the carrying values of $ 425.0  million. The fair values are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the interest rates at which similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed. The carrying values of total variable interest rate long-term debt were $ 201.9  million and $ 221.7  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, and approximate their fair values. Long-term deb t is cl assified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Equity Method Investments The Company holds equity method investments in its joint ventures, which are included in other long-term assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The aggregate carrying amount of these investments was $ 20.5  million and $ 22.4  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. These equity method investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The fair value of the Company’s equity method investments has not been adjusted as there have been no triggering events or changes in circumstance that would have had an adverse impact on the value of these investments. In the event these investments are required to be measured, they would fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value, as the investments are in privately-held entities. Derivative Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and are determined by standard calculations and models that use readily observable market parameters. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates. Industry standard data providers are the primary source for forward and spot rate information for foreign currency exchange rates. The fair values of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For discussion of the Company’s derivatives and hedging, see Note 14. 16 Fair Value of Derivatives Contracts The fair value of the Company’s derivative contracts,
recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, was as follows (in millions): Assets Liabilities Balance Sheet Location January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 Designated as hedging instruments Foreign currency forward contracts Other current assets, other current liabilities $ 1.0   $ 0.3   $ 1.9   $ 2.7   Net investment hedges Other current assets and other long-term assets 6.0   8.2   —   —   Total designated 7.0   8.5   1.9   2.7   Not designated as hedging instruments Foreign currency forward contracts Other current assets, other current liabilities 0.6   1.7   1.7   2.5   Total not designated 0.6   1.7   1.7   2.5   Total
$ 7.6   $ 10.2   $ 3.6   $ 5.2   Amounts related to excluded components, such as forward points, are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness of net investment hedges and are expected to be reclassified into earnings throughout their maturity dates. See Note 11 for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive loss. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow method. This fair value measurement is based on unobservable inputs in the market, and thus, represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreement (e.g., potential payment amounts, length of measurement periods, manner of calculating any amounts due) and utilizes assumptions with regard to future financial and operational milestones, probabilities of achieving such milestones and a discount rate. Depending on the contractual terms of the purchase agreement, the probability of achieving such milestones generally represent the only significant unobservable inputs. The contingent consideration liability is measured at fair value each reporting period and changes in estimates of fair value are recognized in earnings. The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration liability that uses unobservable inputs, was $ 24.7  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022. The maximum potential payout of the contingent consideration as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 was $ 30.7  million. There was
no
contingent consideration as of January 31, 2022, see Note 17. Note 16. Guarantees Letters of Credit The Company has letters of credit which guarantee payment to third parties in the event the Company is in breach of contract terms as detailed in each letter of credit.
The outstanding contingent liability for standby letters of credit was as follows (in millions): January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 Contingent liability for standby letters of credit issued under the Company’s revolving credit facility $ 7.5   $ 7.5   Amounts drawn for letters of credit under the Company’s revolving credit facility $ —   $ —   Advanced Filtration Systems Inc. (AFSI) The Company has an unconsolidated joint venture, AFSI, established by the Company and Caterpillar Inc. (Caterpillar) in 1986. AFSI designs and manufactures high-efficiency fluid filters used in Caterpillar’s machinery worldwide.
The Company and Caterpillar equally own the shares of AFSI, and both companies guaran tee certain
debt and banking services, including credit and debit cards, merchant processing and treasury management services, of the joint venture. The Company accounts for AFSI as an equity method investment. 17 The outstanding debt relating to AFSI, which the Company guarantees half, was $ 64.8
million and $ 68.8
million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. AFSI has $ 63.0  million capacity in a revolving credit facility, which expires in 2024, and $ 17.0  million capacity in an additional multi-currency revolving credit facility, which terminates upon notification by either AFSI or the financial institution. Earnings from AFSI, which are recorded in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings, were $ 0.5
million and $ 1.8
million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, and $ 2.0  million and $ 3.2  million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, respectively. Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies The Company records provisions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and litigation are reviewed quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the status of a particular matter. The Company believes the estimated liability in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for claims or litigation is adequate and appropriate for the probable and estimable outcomes. Liabilities recorded were not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The Company believes it is remote that the settlement of any of the currently identified claims or litigation will be materially in excess of what is accrued. Contingent Compensation and Consideration Acquisition Agreement - Purilogics The Company has an acquisition purchase agreement with Purilogics, which includes deferred payment provisions representing potential milestone payments for Purilogics’ former owners. The provisions are made up of two general types of arrangements, contingent compensation and contingent consideration. The contingent compensation arrangement is contingent on the former owner’s future employment with the Company, and the related amounts are recognized over the required employment period. The contingent consideration is not contingent on employment and was recorded as purchase consideration in both other current and other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of the initial acquisition based on the fair value of the estimated liability. The amounts are paid over a
three - to
five-year
period, contingent on the achievement of certain revenue and manufacturing milestones. The total contingent compensation arrangement liability was $ 0.6  million and $ 0.1  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, which was included in other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum payout of the contingent compensation arrangement upon completion of the future performance periods was $ 3.0  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, inclusive of the $ 0.6  million and $ 0.1  million accrued, respectively. The total contingent consideration liability was $ 23.0  million as of both January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, and was included in other current and other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company primarily determines the contingent consideration liability based on the forecasted probability of achieving certain milestones. The contingent consideration liability is measured at fair value each reporting period and changes in estimates of fair value are recognized in earnings. The maximum payout of the contingent consideration was $ 29.0  million, inclusive of the $ 23.0  million accrued as of both January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022.
Other Acquisition Agreements For other acquisitions, the total contingent compensation arrangement liability was $ 0.6  million and $ 0.3  million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, which was included in other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum payout of the contingent compensation arrangement upon completion of the future performance periods was $ 3.1  million, which terminates in
five years , inclusive of the $ 0.6  million and $ 0.3  million accrued as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.
The total contingent consideration liability was $ 1.7  million, which was included in other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022. The maximum payout of the contingent consideration was $ 1.7  million, which terminates in
three years
and was fully accrued as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022. For additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration liability, see Note 15. 18 Note 18. Segment Reporting During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company announced a company-wide organizational redesign to further support the Company’s growth strategies and better serve its customers. Effective November 1, 2022, as a result of the organizational redesign, the Company established a new segment reporting structure which resulted in
three
reportable segments: Mobile Solutions, Industrial Solutions and Life Sciences. The organizational structure also includes Corporate and unallocated which includes interest expense and certain corporate expenses determined to be non-allocable to the segments, such as restructuring charges and incentive compensation. The Company determines its operating segments consistent with the manner in which it manages its operations and evaluates performance for internal review and decision-making. All prior segment information has been recast to reflect the Company’s new segment structure and current period presentation. The Mobile Solutions segment is organized based on a combination of customers and products and consists of the Off-Road, On-Road and Aftermarket business units. Within these business units, products consist of replacement filters for both air and liquid filtration applications as well as exhaust and emissions. Applications include air filtration systems, fuel and lube systems, exhaust and emissions systems, and sensors, indicators and monitoring systems. Mobile Solutions sells to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the construction, mining, agriculture and transportation end markets and to independent distributors, OEM dealer networks, private label accounts and large fleets. The Industrial Solutions segment is organized based on product type and consists of the Industrial Filtration Solutions (IFS) and Aerospace and Defense business units. Within the IFS business unit, products consist of dust, fume and
mist collectors, compressed air purification systems, air filtration systems for gas turbines , hydraulic applications as well as gas and liquid filtration for industrial processes. Aerospace and Defense products consist of air, fuel and lube filtration sold to the aerospace fixed-wing, rotorcraft and defense ground vehicle industries. The Life Sciences segment consists of micro-environment gas and liquid filtration for food, beverage and industrial processes, bioprocessing equipment, including bioreactors and fermenters, polytetrafluoroethylene membrane-based products, as well as specialized air and gas filtration systems for applications including hard disk drives, semiconductor manufacturing, sensors, indicators and monitoring systems. The Company is an integrated enterprise, characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and sharing of assets.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Founded in 1915, Donaldson Company, Inc. is a global leader in technology-led filtration products and solutions, serving a broad range of industries and advanced markets. Donaldson’s diverse, skilled employees at over 140 locations, 74 of which are manufacturing and distribution centers, on six continents, partner with customers from small business owners to the world’s biggest original equipment manufacturer (OEM) brands to solve complex filtration challenges. Customers choose Donaldson’s filtration solutions due to their stringent performance requirements, natural replacement change cycles and need for reliability. The Mobile Solutions segment is organized based on a combination of customers and products and consists of the Off-Road, On-Road and Aftermarket business units. Within these business units, products consist of replacement filters for both air and liquid filtration applications as well as exhaust and emissions. Applications include air filtration systems, fuel and lube systems, exhaust and emissions systems, and sensors, indicators and monitoring systems. Mobile Solutions sells to OEMs in the construction, mining, agriculture and transportation end markets and to independent distributors, OEM dealer networks, private label accounts and large fleets. The Industrial Solutions segment is organized based on product type and consists of the Industrial Filtration Solutions (IFS) and Aerospace and Defense business units. Within the IFS business unit, products consist of dust, fume and
mist collectors, compressed air purification systems, air filtration systems for gas turbines , hydraulic applications as well as gas and liquid filtration for industrial processes. Aerospace and Defense products consist of air, fuel and lube filtration sold to the aerospace fixed-wing, rotorcraft and defense ground vehicle industries. The Life Sciences segment consists of micro-environment gas and liquid filtration for food, beverage and industrial processes, bioprocessing equipment, including bioreactors and fermenters, polytetrafluoroethylene membrane-based products, as well as specialized air and gas filtration systems for applications including hard disk drives, semiconductor manufacturing, sensors, indicators and monitoring systems. The Company’s results of operations are affected by conditions in the global economic and geopolitical environment. Under most economic conditions, the Company’s diversification across its end markets, its global presence, its diversification through technology and its OEM and replacement parts customers has helped to limit the impact of weakness in any one product line, market or geography on the consolidated operating results of the Company. Operating Environment Inflation While inflation was not as significant in the second quarter or the first six months of fiscal 2023, as compared to the prior year, the Company continues to experience the effects of inflation related to raw materials and other expenses, including labor and energy. These inflationary pressures have had an adverse impact on the Company’s profit margins throughout the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2023, however they have been generally mitigated by pricing actions implemented in the prior year. 21 Consolidated Results of Operations Three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with three months ended January 31, 2022 Operating Results Operating results were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 % of net sales 2022 % of net sales Net sales $ 828.3  $ 802.5  Cost of sales 543.9  65.7  % 552.7  68.9  % Gross profit 284.4  34.3  249.8  31.1  Selling, general and administrative 149.6  18.1  137.5  17.1  Research and development 18.5  2.2  16.6  2.1  Operating expenses 168.1  20.3  154.1  19.2  Operating income 116.3  14.0  95.7  11.9  Interest expense 4.6  0.6  3.6  0.5  Other income, net (1.6) (0.2) (2.4) (0.3) Earnings before income taxes 113.3  13.7  94.5  11.8  Income taxes 27.3  3.3  22.7  2.8  Net earnings

Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by $34.1 million compared to the three months ended January 31, 2022, reflecting decreases in the Mobile Solutions, Industrial Solutions and Life Sciences segments of $21.6 million, $8.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively. D urin g the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company’s net sales increased primarily from higher pricing, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign currency translation. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was 34.3% compared with 31.1% for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The gross margin as a percentage of net sales increase was primarily driven by pricing actions, partially offset by higher input costs.
Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses Selling, general and
administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $149.6 million, or 18.1% of net sales, compared with $137.5 million, or 17.1% of net sales, for the three months ended January 31, 2022, an increase of $12.1 million, or 8.8%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to severance and other organizational redesign charges of $4.5 million, costs mainly associated with the exiting of a lower-margin customer program of $3.3 million and increased headcount to support future growth. 22 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses for
the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $18.5 million, or 2.2% of net sales, compared with $16.6 million, or 2.1% of net sales, for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Non-Operating Items Interest expense for the three months ended January 31, 2023
was $4.6 million, compared with $3.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022, an increase of $1.0 million, or 28.4%. The increase reflected rising variable interest rates and a higher debt level. Other income, net for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $1.6 million, compared with other income, net of $2.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022, a decrease of $0.8 million, which was driven primarily by lower income from joint ventures, partially offset by higher interest income. Income Taxes The effect ive tax rate was 24.1% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. The current year effective tax rate benefitted from increased tax benefits on export income, which were offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and a decrease in discrete tax item benefits. Net Earnings Net earnings for the three months ended January 31, 2023 w ere $86.0 million, compared with $71.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022, an increase of $14.2 million, or 19.8%.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a reduction in inventory in the first six months of the current year compared to a significant increase in inventory in the first six months of the prior year, as well as higher earnings. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended January 31, 2023 was $57.6 million, compared with $82.5 million for the six months ended January 31, 2022, a decrease of $24.9 million. The decrease in cash used was due to the $49.0 million of acquisitions in the first six months of the prior year, partially offset by the higher investment of capital in various projects, including capacity expansion and tooling for new programs, in the first six months of the current year. 27 Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for payment of dividends and repurchases of the Company’s common stock, net of borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended January 31, 2023 was $176.8 million, compared with $45.7 million for the six months ended January 31, 2022, an increase of $131.1 million. The increase was primarily driven by a net debt repayment of $24.7 million in the first six months of the current year, compared to net proceeds of $115.2 million from the issuance of debt in the first six months of the prior year.
To determine the level of dividend and share repurchases, the Company considers recent and projected performance across key financial metrics, including earnings, cash flow from operations and total debt. Dividends paid for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $56.2 million and $54.6 million, respectively. Share repurchases for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $115.2 million and $115.6 million , respectiv ely. Capital Resources Additional sources of liquidity are existing cash and available credit facilities. Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2023 was $179.4 million, compared with $193.3 million as of July 31, 2022. The Company has capacity of $648.0 million available for further borrowing under existing credit facilities as of January 31, 2023, which includes $392.5 million available on the Company’s $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on May 21, 2026.
The Company believes the liquidity available from the combination of expected cash generated by operating activities, existing cash and available credit under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, payment of anticipated dividends, share repurchase activity and potential acquisitions. Financial Condition Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt As of January 31, 2023, total debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt, represented 34.5% of total capitalization, defined as total debt plus total stockholders’ equity, compared with 36.4% as of July 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants. Long-term debt outstanding was $624.8 million as of January 31, 2023, compared with $644.3 million as of July 31, 2022, a decrease of $19.5 million, primarily due to a repayment on the unsecured revolving credit facility during the first six months of fiscal 2023. As of January 31, 2023, there was $392.5 million available and $100.0 million outstanding on the Company’s $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on May 21, 2026. Working Capital In order to help measure and analyze the impact of working capital management, the Company reviews its cash conversion cycle. The Company calculates days sales outstanding as the average accounts receivable, net for the quarter, divided by net sales for the quarter multiplied by the number of days in the quarter. The Company calculates days inventory outstanding as the average inventories, net for the quarter, divided by cost of sales for the quarter multiplied by the number of days in the quarter, and calculates inventory turns as the cost of sales for the quarter, annualized by the ratio of the number of days in the year to the number of days in the quarter, divided by the average inventories, net for the quarter. The Company calculates days payable outstanding as the average accounts payable for the quarter, divided by cost of sales for the quarter multiplied by the number of days in the quarter. Accounts receivable, net as of January 31, 2023, was $574.5 million, compared with $616.6 million as of July 31, 2022, a decrease of $42.1 million. Days sales outstanding were 64 days as of January 31, 2023, an increase from 62 days as of July 31, 2022.
Inventories, net as of January 31, 2023, was $501.3 million, compared with $502.4 million as of July 31, 2022, a decrease of $1.1 million. Days inventory outstanding were 84 days as of January 31, 2023, an increase from 78 days as of July 31, 2022. Inventory turns were 4.4 times and 4.7 times per year as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.
Accounts payable as of January 31, 2023, was $302.1 million, compared with $338.5 million as of July 31, 2022, a decrease of $36.4 million. Days payable outstanding were 53 days as of January 31, 2023, an increase from 52 days as of July 31, 2022.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company guarantees 50% of certain debt of its joint venture, Advanced Filtration Systems Inc., as discussed in Note 16 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Fin ancial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 28 Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates as disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted For new accounting standards not yet adopted, refer to Note 1 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 The Company, through its management, may make forward-looking statements reflecting the Company’s current views with respect to future events and expectations, such as forecasts, plans, trends and projections relating to the Company’s business and financial performance. These forward-looking statements, which may be included in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), in press releases and in other documents and materials as well as in written or oral statements made by or on behalf of the Company, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. The words or phrases such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “will allow,” “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “plan” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as enacted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). In particular, the Company desires to take advantage of the protections of the PSLRA in connection with the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements do not guarantee future performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date such statements are made and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s performance and could cause the Company’s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed. These factors include, but are not limited to, challenges in global operations; impacts of global economic, industrial and political conditions on product demand, including the Russia and Ukraine conflict; impacts from unexpected events, including the COVID-19 pandemic; effects of unavailable raw materials or material cost inflation; inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; inability to meet customer demand; inability to maintain competitive advantages; threats from disruptive technologies; effects of highly competitive markets with pricing pressure; exposure to customer concentration in certain cyclical industries; inability to manage productivity improvements; results of execution of any acquisition, divestiture and other strategic transactions; vulnerabilities associated with information technology systems and security; inability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights; costs associated with governmental laws and regulations; impacts of foreign currency fluctuations; and effects of changes in capital and credit markets. These and other factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company’s market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. To manage these risks, the Company employs certain strategies to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations. The Company does not enter into any of these strategies for trading or speculative purposes. The Company maintains significant assets and operations outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to foreign currency gains and losses. A portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposure is naturally hedged by incurring liabilities, including bank debt, denominated in the local currency in which the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are located. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger than in the six months ended January 31, 2022 compared with many of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company operates. The overall stronger dollar had a negative impact on the Company’s international net sales and net earnings because the foreign denominated revenues translated into less U.S. dollars in many regions around the world. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation for the six months ended January 31, 2023 resulted in an overall decrease in reported net sales of $93.0 million and a decrease in reported net earnings of $11.8 million. Derivative Fair Value Measurements The Company enters into derivative instrument agreements, including foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges, to manage risk in connection with changes in foreign currency. The Company only enters into derivative instrument agreements with counterparties who have highly rated credit. See Notes 11, 14 and 15 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 29 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts - Cash Flow Hedges and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The Company buys materials from foreign suppliers. Those transactions can be denominated in those suppliers’ local currency. The Company also sells to customers in foreign countries. Those transactions can be denominated in those customers’ local currency. Both of these transaction types can create volatility in the Company’s financial statements. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage those exposures and fluctuations. These contracts generally mature in 12 months or less, which is consistent with the forecasts of the related purchases and sales. Certain contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, whereas the remaining contracts, most of which are related to certain intercompany transactions which offset balance sheet exposure, are not designated as hedging instruments. The total notional amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges were $77.2 million and $158.0 million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. The total notional amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges were $207.9 million and $151.6 million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. Net Investment Hedges The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap agreements to hedge its exposure to adverse foreign currency exchange rate
movements for i ts operations in Europe. The Company has elected the spot method for designating these contracts as net investment hedges. The total notional amount of net investment hedges was €80 million, or $88.8 million, as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022. The maturity dates range from 2027 to 2029. Based on the net investment hedges outstanding as of January 31, 2023, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar compared to the Euro would result in a net gain of $7.6 million in the fair value of these contracts. Interest Rates The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to debt obligations that are at variable rates, as well as the potential increase in the fair value of long-term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates. As of January 31, 2023, the Company’s financial liabilities with exposure to changes in interest rates consisted mainly of $100.0 million outstanding on the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility, €80.0 million, or $86.6 million, of a variable rate term loan and ¥2.0 billion, or $15.3 million, of variable rate senior notes. Assuming a hypothetical 0.5 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates, with all other variables remaining constant, interest expense would have increased approximately $0.4 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023. We have no interest rate hedging agreements. Interest rate changes would also affect the fair market value of fixed-rate debt. As of January 31, 2023, the estimated fair values of fixed interest rate long-term debt were $386.4 million compared to the carrying values of $425.0 million. The fair values are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the interest rates at which similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed.
The interest on cash and cash equivalents will vary as short-term yields change. Assuming a hypothetical 0.5 percentage point increase in yields, with all other variables remaining constant, interest income would have increased approximately $0.4 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023. Commodity Prices The Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuating prices of purchased commodity raw materials, including steel, filter media and petrochemical-based products including plastics, rubber and adhesives. On an ongoing basis, the Company enters into selective supply arrangements that allow the Company to reduce volatility in its costs. The Company strives to recover or offset all material cost increases through price increases to its customers and the Company’s cost reduction initiatives, which include material substitution, process improvement and product redesigns. However, an increase in commodity prices could result in lower gross profit. Bankers’ Acceptance Notes Consistent with common business practice in APAC, the Company has subsidiaries which accept bankers’ acceptance notes from their customers in settlement of certain customer billed accounts receivable. Bankers’ acceptance notes represent a commitment by the issuing financial institution to pay a certain amount of money at a specified future maturity date to the legal owner of the bankers’ acceptance note as of the maturity date. The maturity dates of bankers’ acceptance notes vary, but it is the Company’s policy to only accept bankers’ acceptance notes with maturity dates no more than 180 days from the date of the Company’s receipt of such draft. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company owned $7.0 million and $12.6 million, respectively, of these bankers’ acceptance notes and includes them in accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 30 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed so information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 31 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company records provisions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and litigation are reviewed quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the status of a particular matter. The Company believes the estimated liability in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for claims or litigation is adequate and appropriate for the probable and estimable outcomes. Liabilities recorded were not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The Company believes it is remote that the settlement of any of the currently identified claims or litigation will be materially in excess of what is accrued. Item 1A. Risk Factors There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s global operations that involve the manufacturing and sale of products for highly demanding customer applications throughout the world. These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect the Company’s operating performances or financial condition. The “Risk Factors” section in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 outlines the risks and uncertainties the Company believes are the most material to its business. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Repurchases of Equity Securities Information in connection with purchases made by, or on behalf of, the Company or any affiliated purchaser of the Company, of shares of the Company’s common stock during the three months ended January 31, 2023 was as follows: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs November 1 - November 30, 2022 322,135  $ 58.79  320,674  4,196,687  December 1 - December 31, 2022 898,219  59.55  851,882  3,344,805  January 1 - January 31, 2023 —  —  —  3,344,805  Total 1,220,354  $ 59.35  1,172,556  3,344,805  On May 31, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 13.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock.

There were no repurchases of common stock made outside of the Company’s current repurchase authorization during the three months ended January 31, 2023. The “Total Number of Shares Purchased” column of the table above includes 47,798 shares of previously owned shares tendered by option holders in payment of the exercise price of options during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. While not considered repurchases of shares, the Company does at times withhold shares that would otherwise be issued under stock-based awards to cover the withholding of taxes due as a result of exercising stock options or payment of stock-based awards.
