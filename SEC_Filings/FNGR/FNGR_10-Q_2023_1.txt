FINGERMOTION,
INC.
Nine
months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021
Notes
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note
1 – Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation
FingerMotion,
Inc. fka Property Management Corporation of America (the “Company”) was incorporated on January 23, 2014, under the laws
of the State of Delaware. The Company then offered management and consulting services to residential and commercial real estate property
owners who rent or lease their property to third-party tenants.
The
Company changed its name to FingerMotion, Inc. on July 13, 2017, after a change in control. In July 2017 the Company acquired all of
the outstanding shares of Finger Motion Company Limited (“FMCL”), a Hong Kong corporation that is an information technology
company which specialize in operating and publishing mobile games.
Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement with FMCL, effective July 13, 2017 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”, the Company agreed to
exchange the outstanding equity stock of FMCL held by the FMCL Shareholders for shares of common stock of the Company. At the Closing
Date, the Company issued
12,000,000
shares of common stock to the FMCL shareholders. In addition, the Company issued
600,000
shares to
other consultants in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement.
The
transaction was accounted for as a “reverse acquisition” since, immediately following completion of the transaction, the
shareholders of FMCL effectuated control of the post-combination Company. For accounting purposes, FMCL was deemed to be the accounting
acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction is treated as a recapitalization of FMCL (i.e., a capital transaction
involving the issuance of shares by the Company for the shares of FMCL). Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities, and results
of operations of FMCL became the historical financial statements of FingerMotion, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and the Company’s
assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with FMCL beginning on the acquisition date. No step-up in basis or intangible
assets or goodwill were recorded in this transaction.
As
a result of the Share Exchange Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereunder, FMCL became a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company. FMCL, a Hong Kong corporation, was formed in April 6, 2016.
On
October 16, 2018, the Company through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai JiuGe Business Management Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe
Management”), entered into a series of agreements known as variable interest agreements (the “VIE Agreements”) pursuant
to which Shanghai JiuGe Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe Technology”) became JiuGe Management’s contractually
controlled affiliate. The use of VIE agreements is a common structure used to acquire PRC corporations, particularly in certain industries
in which foreign investment is restricted or forbidden by the PRC government. The VIE Agreements include a Consulting Services Agreement,
a Loan Agreement, a Power of Attorney Agreement, a Call Option Agreement, and a Share Pledge Agreement in order to secure the connection
and commitments of JiuGe Technology.
On
March 7, 2019, JiuGe Technology also acquired 99% of the equity interest of Beijing XunLian (“BX”), a subsidiary that provides
bulk distribution of SMS messages for JiuGe customers at discounted rates.
Finger
Motion Financial Company Limited was incorporated on January 24, 2020, and is 100% owned by FingerMotion, Inc. The company has been activated

Summary of Principal Accounting Policies
Principles
of Consolidation and Presentation
The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Variable
interest entity
Pursuant
to Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Section 810, “Consolidation”
(“ASC 810”), the Company is required to include in its consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of its
variable interest entities (“VIEs”). ASC 810 requires a VIE to be consolidated if that company is subject to a majority of
the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which
a company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risk of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity,
and therefore the company is the primary beneficiary of the entity.
Under
ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has
both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s
economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant
to the VIE. The reporting entity’s determination of whether it has this power is not affected by the existence of kick-out rights
or participating rights, unless a single enterprise, including its related parties and de - facto agents, have the unilateral ability
to exercise those rights. JiuGe Technology’s actual stockholders do not hold any kick-out rights that affect the consolidation
determination.
Through
the VIE agreements disclosed in Note 1, the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of JiuGe Technology. Accordingly, the results of
JiuGe Technology have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. JiuGe Technology has no assets that are collateral
for or restricted solely to settle their obligations. The creditors of JiuGe Technology do not have recourse to the Company’s general
credit.

Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other
information available when the financial statements are prepared. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Certain
Risks and Uncertainties
The
Company relies on cloud-based hosting through a global accredited hosting provider. Management believes that alternate sources are available;
however, disruption or termination of this relationship could adversely affect our operating results in the near term.
Identifiable
Intangible Assets
Identifiable
intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized over
3 - 10
years. Similar to tangible property and equipment, the Company periodically
evaluates identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
The
Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements,
and (iv) finite–lived intangible assets.
Long-lived
assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology,
economy, or other industry changes. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment,
the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the
carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including
discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered
necessary.
The
Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values
of the respective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and the remaining useful lives of long-lived
assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic
trends, and internal factors such as the Company’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.
Accounts
Receivable and Concentration of Risk
Accounts
receivable, net is stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, or the net realizable value. The Company provides a provision
for allowances that includes returns, allowances, and doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company estimates
its provision for allowances based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable.
It is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimate of the provision for allowances will change.

Lease
Operating
and finance lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the
future lease payments over the lease term. When the rate implicit to the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company utilizes its
incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of the future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is derived from
information available at the lease commencement date and represents the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow
on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The right-of-use
asset includes any lease payments made and lease incentives received prior to the commencement date. Operating lease right-of-use assets
also include any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent when the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term. The right-of-use assets
and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise
that option.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments placed with banks, which
have original maturities of three months or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives range from three
3
to
7
seven
years. Land is classified as held for sale when management has the ability and intent to sell, in accordance with ASC Topic
360-45.
Earnings
Per Share
Basic
(loss) earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of
potential common shares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.
FASB
Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share
options, non-vested shares and similar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted
earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share should be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited,
unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the “treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based
payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share. Antidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive
securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact was antidilutive.

Revenue
Recognition
The
Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) beginning on January 1, 2018 using the modified
retrospective approach. ASC 606 establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires
an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.
The
Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by reviewing its existing customer contracts and current accounting policies and practices
to identify differences that will result from applying the new requirements, including the evaluation of its performance obligations,
transaction price, customer payments, transfer of control and principal versus agent considerations. Based on the assessment, the Company
concluded that there was no change to the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams in scope of ASC 606
and therefore there was no material changes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption of ASC 606.
The
Company recognizes revenue from providing hosting and integration services and licensing the use of its technology platform to its customers.
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;
(2) the service has been provided to the customer (for licensing, revenue is recognized when the Company’s technology is used to
provide hosting and integration services); (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection
of fees is probable. We account for our multi-element arrangements, such as instances where we design a custom website and separately
offer other services such as hosting, which are recognized over the period for when services are performed.
Income
Taxes
The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). Under this method, income tax expense is recognized as the amount of: (i) taxes
payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of available
evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Non-controlling
interest
Non-controlling
interests held 1% of the shares of two of our subsidiaries are recorded as a component of our equity, separate from the Company’s
equity. Purchase or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Results
of operations attributable to the non-controlling interest are included in our consolidated results of operations and, upon loss of control,
the interest sold, as well as interest retained, if any, will be reported at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company does not believe recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.

Going Concern
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company
had an accumulated deficit of $ 22,655,652
and $ 17,152,172
as at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 respectively, and had a net loss
of $ 5,504,481
and $ 3,401,295
for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The
Company’s continuation as a going concern depends on its ability to obtain additional financing to fund operations, implement its
business model, and ultimately, attain profitable operations. The Company will need to secure additional funds through various means,
including equity and debt financing or any similar financing. There can be no assurance that the Company can obtain additional equity
or debt financing, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Any additional equity or debt financing may involve
substantial dilution to the Company’s stockholders, restrictive covenants, or high interest costs. The Company’s long-term
liquidity also depends upon its ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability.

Right-of-use Asset and Lease Liability
The
Company has entered into lease agreements with various third parties. The terms of operating leases are one to two years. These operating
leases are included in "Right-of-use Asset" on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the Company’s

liability" on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, the Company has entered into various short-term
operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company's Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the nine months ended November

Convertible Notes Payable
A
Note Payable having a Face Value of $ 730,000
on May 1, 2022 and accruing interest at
20 % is due on
April 30, 2023 . The note is convertible
anytime from the date of issuance into $ 0.0001
par value Common Stock at $ 4.00
per share.
A
secured, two-year, interest-free convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $ 4,800,000
was issued on August 9, 2022 representing
a funded amount of $4,000,000 and a coupon of 20% (the “Note”). The principal amount is payable commencing 180 days after
the issuance in 18 consecutive monthly payments, at the option of the Company, to be made in either cash, shares of common stock of the
Company, or a combination of cash and shares of the common stock of the Company. The note shall be available to be converted by the holder
any time after the earlier of 6 months from the date of issuance or the date of effectiveness of the registration statement covering
the applicable conversion shares into $ 0.0001
par value Common stock at $ 2.00
per share subject to adjustment as provided therein.
An
event of default under the Note occurred on November 4, 2022 and on November 21, 2022 pursuant to section 2.1(e) of the Note in relation
to the closing of our private placements of shares of common stock in the aggregate amount of
2,887,500
shares at a price of $ 4.00
per
share for gross proceeds of $ 11,550,000
(the “Private Placement Proceeds”).
Section
2.2 of the Note provides for the remedies upon an event of default, which as described in the Note, the holder may at any time at its
option declare the Note immediately due and payable at an amount of 110% or 120% of the outstanding principal amount (the “Mandatory
Default Amount”) depending on the type of event of default. In addition, upon an event of default, subject to any applicable cure
periods, the holder may (a) from time-to-time demand that all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount be converted into shares
of our common stock at the lower of (i) the conversion price (currently $2.00 per share) and (ii) 80% of the average of the three (3)
lowest daily VWAPs during the twenty (20) days prior to the delivery of the conversion notice, or (b) exercise or otherwise enforce any
one or more of the holder’s rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests under the Note, the Purchase Agreement, the other
transaction documents or applicable law.
The
Mandatory Default Amount for an event of default under Section 2.1(e) of the Note is 110% of the outstanding principal amount of the
Note, which is $ 5,280,000 . However, the holder has not declared the Mandatory Default Amount due and payable, which is the trigger for
accelerating the Mandatory Default Amount to be due and payable.
In
addition, section 5.7 of the Purchase Agreement provides that if we issued any equity interests, other than “Exempted Securities”
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement), for aggregate proceeds to us of greater than $10,000,000 during the term of the Purchase Agreement,
excluding offering costs and other expenses, unless otherwise waived in writing by and at the discretion of the holder, we will direct
25% of such proceeds from such issuance to repay the Note.  We
have advised the holder that the aggregate Private Placement Proceeds exceeds $10,000,000 and the holder does not seek to waive or require
payment of 25% of the proceeds as repayment of the Note.

and $ 1,235,861 , resulting from certain net
operating losses in U.S., respectively. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which those net operating losses are available. The Company considers projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making its assessment. At present, the Company concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be able
to realize all of its tax benefits in the near future and therefore a valuation allowance has been provided for the full value of the
deferred tax asset. A valuation allowance will be maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of any

Notes
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
An
event of default under the Note occurred on November 4, 2022 and on November 21, 2022 pursuant to section 2.1(e) of the Note in relation
to the closing of our private placements of shares of common stock in the aggregate amount of
2,887,500
shares at a price of $ 4.00
per
share for gross proceeds of $ 11,550,000
(the “Private Placement Proceeds”).
Section
2.2 of the Note provides for the remedies upon an event of default, which as described in the Note, the holder may at any time at its
option declare the Note immediately due and payable at an amount of 110% or 120% of the outstanding principal amount (the “Mandatory
Default Amount”) depending on the type of event of default. In addition, upon an event of default, subject to any applicable cure
periods, the holder may (a) from time-to-time demand that all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount be converted into shares
of our common stock at the lower of (i) the conversion price (currently $2.00 per share) and (ii) 80% of the average of the three (3)
lowest daily VWAPs during the twenty (20) days prior to the delivery of the conversion notice, or (b) exercise or otherwise enforce any
one or more of the holder’s rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests under the Note, the Purchase Agreement, the other
transaction documents or applicable law.
The
Mandatory Default Amount for an event of default under Section 2.1(e) of the Note is 110% of the outstanding principal amount of the
Note, which is $ 5,280,000 . However, the holder has not declared the Mandatory Default Amount due and payable, which is the trigger for
accelerating the Mandatory Default Amount to be due and payable.
In
addition, section 5.7 of the Purchase Agreement provides that if we issued any equity interests, other than “Exempted Securities”
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement), for aggregate proceeds to us of greater than $10,000,000 during the term of the Purchase Agreement,
excluding offering costs and other expenses, unless otherwise waived in writing by and at the discretion of the holder, we will direct
25% of such proceeds from such issuance to repay the Note.  We
have advised the holder that the aggregate Private Placement Proceeds exceeds $10,000,000 and the holder does not seek to waive or require
payment of 25% of the proceeds as repayment of the Note.

Introduction
This

Corporate
Information
The
Company was initially incorporated as Property Management Corporation of America on January 23, 2014 in the State of Delaware.
On
June 21, 2017, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding
common stock, to increase the authorized shares of common stock to 200,000,000 shares and to change the name of the Company from “Property
Management Corporation of America” to “FingerMotion, Inc.” (the “ Corporate Actions ”). The Corporate
Actions and the amended certificate of incorporation became effective on June 21, 2017.
Our
principal executive offices are located at 1460 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, and our telephone number at that address is (347)
349-5339.
We
are a holding company incorporated in Delaware and not an operating company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China (the
“PRC” or “China”). As a holding company, we conduct a significant part of our operations through our subsidiaries
and through the VIE Agreements with the VIE based in China. To address challenges resulting from laws, policies and practices that may
disfavor foreign-owned entities that operate within industries deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, we use the VIE structure to
provide contractual exposure to foreign investment in the PRC-based companies. We own 100% of the equity of a WFOE, Shanghai JiuGe Business
Management Co., Ltd., which has entered into the VIE Agreements with the VIE, which is owned by Ms. Li Li the legal representative and
general manager, and also the shareholder of the VIE. The VIE Agreements have not been tested in court. As a result of our use of the
VIE structure, you may never directly hold equity interests the VIE. The securities offered pursuant to this prospectus are securities
of the Company, the Delaware holding company, not of the VIE.
We
fund the registered capital and operating expenses of the VIE by extending loans to the shareholders of the VIE. The VIE Agreements governing
the relationship between the VIE and our WFOE enable us to (i) direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s
economic performance, (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the VIE, and (iii) have an exclusive call option to
purchase, at any time, all or part of the equity interests in and/or assets of the VIE to the extent permitted by Chinese laws. As a
result of the VIE Agreements, the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE for accounting purposes and is able to consolidate
the financial results of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

platforms or paying China Unicom or China Mobile directly, we offer mobile data and talk time at a rate discounted from these companies’
stated rates, which are also the rates we must pay to them to purchase the mobile data and talk time provided to consumers through the
use of our platform. Accordingly, we earn income on the rebates we receive from the telecommunications companies, reduced by the amounts
by which we discount the mobile data and talk time sold through our platform.

Because
we do not directly hold equity interests in the VIE, we are subject to risks and uncertainties of the interpretations and applications
of Chinese laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the validity and enforcement of the VIE Agreements among the WFOE, the
VIE and the shareholder of the VIE. We are also subject to the risks and uncertainties about any future actions of the Chinese government
in this regard that could disallow the VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and may cause
the value of our Common Shares to depreciate significantly or become worthless.
- 29 -
Table of Contents
The
VIE Agreements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. For instance, the VIE and its shareholders
could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner
or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. The shareholder of the VIE may not act in the best interests of our Company
or may not perform their obligations under the VIE Agreements. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate certain
portions of our business through the VIE Agreements with the VIE. In the event that the VIE or its shareholder fail to perform their
respective obligations under the VIE Agreements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such
arrangements. In addition, even if legal actions are taken to enforce the VIE Agreements, there is uncertainty as to whether Chinese
courts would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of the securities laws of the United States or any state. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the VIE Agreements”. We
rely on the VIE Agreements with the VIE and its shareholder for a significant portion of our business operations. The VIE Agreements
may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. Any failure by the VIE or its shareholder to perform their
obligations under such contractual arrangements would have a material and adverse effect on our business.
As
of the date of this periodic report on Form 10-Q, we and the VIE are not required to seek permissions from the CSRC, the Cyberspace Administration
of China (the “CAC”), or any other entity that is required to approve of the operations of the VIE, other than a value-added
telecommunications business licence, which has already been obtained. Nevertheless, Chinese regulatory authorities may in the future
promulgate laws, regulations or implement rules that require us, our subsidiaries or the VIEs to obtain permissions from such regulatory
authorities to approve the operations of the VIE or any securities listing.
Overview
The
Company is a mobile data specialist company that operates the following lines of business: (i) Telecommunications Products and Services;
(ii) Value Added Product and Services; (iii) Short Message Services (“SMS”) and Multimedia Messaging Services (“MMS”);
(iv) a Rich Communication Services (“RCS”) platform; (v) Big Data Insights; and (vi) a Video Game Division (inactive).
Telecommunications
Products and Services
The
Company’s current product mix consisting of payment and recharge services, data plans, subscription plans, mobile phones, loyalty
points redemption and other products bundles (i.e. mobile protection plans). Chinese mobile phone consumers often utilize third-party
e-marketing websites to pay their phone bills. If the consumer connected directly to the telecommunications provider to pay his or her
bill, the consumer would miss out on any benefits or marketing discounts that e-marketers provide. Thus, consumers log on to these e-marketer’s
websites, click into their respective phone provider’s store, and “top up,” or pay, their telecommunications provider
for additional mobile data and talk time.
To
connect to the respective mobile telecommunications providers, these e-marketers must utilize a portal licensed by the applicable telecommunication
company that processes the payment. We have been granted one of these licenses by China Unicom and China Mobile, each of which is a major
telecommunications provider in China. We principally earn revenue by providing mobile payment and recharge services to customers of China
Unicom and China Mobile.
We
conduct our mobile payment business through JiuGe Technology, our contractually controlled affiliate through the entry into a series
of agreements known as VIE Agreements in October 2018. In the first half of 2018, JiuGe Technology secured contracts with China Unicom
and China Mobile to distribute mobile data for businesses and corporations in nine provinces/municipalities, namely Chengdu, Jiangxi,
Jiangsu, Chongqing, Shanghai, Zhuhai, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Henan and Fujian. In September 2018, JiuGe Technology launched
and commercialized mobile payment and recharge services to businesses for China Unicom. In May 2021, JiuGe Technology signed a volume-based
agreement with China Mobile Fujian to offer recharge services to the Fujian province which we have launched and commercialized in November
2021.

The
JiuGe Technology mobile payment and recharge platform enables the seamless delivery of real-time payment and recharge services to third-party
channels and businesses. We earn a rebate from each telecommunications company on the funds paid by consumers to the telecommunications
companies we process. To encourage consumers to utilize our portal instead of using our competitors’ platforms or paying China
Unicom or China Mobile directly, we offer mobile data and talk time at a rate discounted from these companies’ stated rates, which
are also the rates we must pay to them to purchase the mobile data and talk time provided to consumers through the use of our platform.
Accordingly, we earn income on the rebates we receive from China Unicom and China Mobile, reduced by the amounts by which we discount
the mobile data and talk time sold through our platform.
FingerMotion
started and commercialized its “Business to Business” (“ B2B ”) model by integrating with various e-commerce
platforms to provide its mobile payment and recharge services to subscribers or end consumers. In the first quarter of 2019 FingerMotion
expanded its business by commercializing its first “Business to Consumer” (“ B2C ”) model, offering the
telecommunication providers’ products and services, including data plans, subscription plans, mobile phones, and loyalty points
redemption, directly to subscribers or customers of the e-commerce companies, such as PinDuoDuo (“ PDD ”), TMall (“ TMALL ”)
and JD.Com (“ JD ”). The Company is planning to further expand its universal exchange platform by setting up B2C stores
on several other major e-commerce platforms in China. In addition to that, we have been assigned as one of China’s Mobile’s
loyalty redemption partner where we will be providing the services for their customers via our platform.
Additionally,
as previously disclosed, on July 7, 2019, JiuGe Technology, our contractually controlled affiliate, entered into that certain Yunnan
Unicom Electronic Sales Platform Construction and Operation Cooperation Agreement (the “ Cooperation Agreement ”) with
China Unicom’s Yunnan subsidiary. Under the Cooperation Agreement, JiuGe Technology is responsible for constructing and operating
China Unicom’s electronic sales platform through which consumers can purchase various goods and services from China Unicom, including
mobile telephones, mobile telephone service, broadband data services, terminals, “smart” devices and related financial insurance.
The Cooperation Agreement provides that JiuGe Technology is required to construct and operate the platform’s webpage in accordance
with China Unicom’s specifications and policies, and applicable law, and bear all expenses in connection therewith. As consideration
for the service it provides under the Cooperation Agreement, JiuGe Technology receives a percentage of the revenue received from all
sales it processes for China Unicom on the platform. The Cooperation Agreement expires three years from the date of its signature with
yearly auto-renewal terms, but it may be terminated by (i) JiuGe Technology upon three months’ written notice or (ii) by China
Unicom unilaterally.
During
the recent fiscal year, the Company expanded its offering under their telecommunication product and services by increasing their product
line revenue streams. In March 2020, FingerMotion secured a contract with both China Mobile and China Unicom to acquire new users to
take up the respective subscription plans.
In
February 2021, we increased the mobile phones sales to end users using all of our platforms. This business will continue to contribute
to the overall revenue for the group as part of our offering to our customers.
Value
Added Product and Services
These
are new product and services that the Company expects to secure and work with the telecommunication provider and all our e-commerce platform
partners to market. The current and upcoming value-added product is the Mobile Protection programs which we plan to launch soon. In February
2022, our contractually controlled subsidiary, JiuGe Technology, through its 99% own subsidiary TengLian signed an agreement with both
China Unicom and China Mobile to co-operate to roll out the Mobile Device Protection product which is incorporated into the Telecommunication
subscription plans in line with their roll out of new mobile phones and new 5G phones. In mid-July 2022, we launched the roll out of
the Mobile Device protection product with the roll out of the new mobile phones and 5G phones.

SMS
and MMS Services
On
March 7, 2019, the Company through JiuGe Technology acquired Beijing XunLian TianXia Technology Co., Ltd. ( “Beijing Technology” ),
a company in the business of providing mass SMS text services to businesses looking to communicate with large numbers of their customers
and prospective customers. With this acquisition, the Company expanded into a second partnership with the telecom companies by acquiring
bulk SMS and MMS bundles at reduced prices and offering bulk SMS services to end consumers with competitive pricing. FingerMotion’s
subsidiary, Beijing Technology, retains a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
(“MIIT”)
to operate the SMS and MMS business in the PRC. Similar to the mobile payment and recharge business, Beijing Technology is required to
make a deposit or bulk purchase in advance and has secured business customers, including premium car manufacturers, hotel chains, airlines
and e-commerce companies, that utilize Beijing Technology’s SMS integrated platform to send bulk SMS text messages monthly. Beijing
Technology has the capability to manage and track the entire process, including guiding the Company’s customer to meet MIIT’s
guidelines on messages composed, until the SMS messages have been delivered successfully.
Rich
Communication Services
In
March 2020, the Company began the development of an RCS platform, also known as Messaging as a Platform (“MaaP”). This RCS
platform will be a proprietary business messaging platform that enables businesses and brands to communicate and service their customers
on the 5G infrastructure, delivering a better and more efficient user experience at a lower cost. For example, with the new 5G RCS message
service, consumers will have the ability to list available flights by sending a message regarding a holiday and will also be able to
book and buy flights by sending messages. This will allow telecommunication providers like China Unicom and China Mobile to retain users
on their systems, without having to utilize third party apps or log onto the Internet, which will increase their user retention. We expect
this to open up a new marketing channel for the Company’s current and prospective business partners.
Big
Data Insights
In
July 2020, the Company launched its proprietary technology platform “Sapientus” as its big data insights arm to deliver data-driven
solutions and insights for businesses within the insurance, healthcare, and financial services industries. The Company applies its vast
experience in the insurance and financial services industry and capabilities in technology and data analytics to develop revolutionary
solutions targeted towards insurance and financial consumers. Integrating diverse publicly available information, insurance and financial
based data with technology and finally registering them into the FingerMotion telecommunications and insurance ecosystem, the Company
would be able to provide functional insights and facilitate the transformation of key components of the insurance value chain, including
driving more effective and efficient underwriting, enabling fraud evaluation and management, empowering channel expansion and market
penetration through novel product innovation, and more. The ultimate objective is to promote, enhance and deliver better value to our
partners and customers.
The
Company’s proprietary risk assessment engine offers standard and customized scoring and appraisal services based on multi-dimensional
factors. The Company has the ability to provide potential customers and partners with insights-driven and technology-enabled solutions
and applications including preferred risk selection, precision marketing, product customization, and claims management (e.g., fraud detection).
The Company’s mission is to deliver the next generation of data-driven solutions in the financial services, healthcare, and insurance
industries that result in more accurate risk assessments, more efficient processes, and a more delightful user experience.
On
or around January 25, 2021, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Finger Motion Financial Company Limited’s, big data analytic
arm branded “Sapientus,” entered into a services agreement with Pacific Life Re, a global life reinsurer serving the insurance
industry with a comprehensive suite of products and services.
In
December 2021, the Company through JiuGe Technology formed a collaborative research alliance with Munich Re in extending behavioral analytics
to enhance understanding of morbidity and behavioral patterns in China market, with the goal of creating value for both insurers and
the end insurance consumers through better technology, product offerings and customer experience.

Our
Video Game Division
The
video game industry covers multiple sectors and is currently experiencing a move away from physical games towards digital software. Advances
in technology and streaming now allow users to download games rather than visiting retailers. Video game publishers are expanding their
direct-to-consumer channels with mobile gaming, the current growth leader, and eSports and virtual reality gaining momentum as the next
big sectors. In June 2018, we temporarily paused its publishing and operating plans for existing games, and the Company’s Board
of Directors decided to re-focus the company’s resources into new business opportunities in China, particularly the mobile phone
payment and data business.

months ended November 30, 2021. This increase resulted from an increase in revenue of $7,065,008 and $187,500 from our Telecommunication
Products & Services and Big Data business, respectively, offset in part by a decrease in revenue of $1,751,472 from our SMS &
MMS business. We principally earn revenue by providing mobile payment and recharge services to customers of telecommunications companies
in China. Specifically, we earn a negotiated rebate amount from the telecommunications companies for all monies paid by consumers to
those companies that we process. An increase in this line of business was evident especially on the mobile recharge revenue as we had
deployed certain funding that we had secured in the last few months to this line of business. We plan to continue to develop this mobile
recharge business and expect that revenues would continue to grow when we continue to deploy more funds. In contrast, our SMS texting
service has shown a drop in revenue as compared to the previous quarter. We are facing some challenges in this line of business due to
the ongoing Covid outbreak in China. As for Big Data business, the revenue is ongoing with the contract secured in August 2022 with Pacific
Life Re in Asia to advance to the next phase of collaboration expected to be completed by third quarter of our next financial year. The
development with other re-insurance companies is in progress.

three months ended November 30, 2021. The increase of $22,103 or14% was mainly due to higher data access and usage fees charged by telecommunications
companies.
Our
Insurtech division focuses on consumer behavioral insights extraction for the purpose of risk assessment. Insights are mined from a multitude
of data sources, harmonized with the objectives of our various business partners. The initial phase of business application is to focus
on insurance industry particularly in the area of underwriting risk rating, complementary claims adjudication and assessment, and risk
segmentation & market penetration.
This
division comprises of experienced actuaries, data scientists and computer programmers.
The
expenses for research & development include associated wages and salaries, data access fees and IT infrastructure.
Over
the past year, we have deepened the Company’s determined commitment toward working with partners in elucidating consumer insights
via big data algorithms and applying behavioral analytics to the fintech sector in sparking new innovations and commercial applications.
The following capture the most recent accomplishments and milestones:
● Strengthening
partnership network – Signed a new agreement to advance to the next phase of collaboration
with Pacific Life Re in Asia.
● Upgrade
of the analytic engine – We have enriched the algorithms with more elaborative auxiliary
data, which, in conjunction with the existing information system and records, will lend transformational
support and capabilities to the analytics, empowering more precise and robust results that
are suited for commercial applications. The collaborative research studies with leading industry
partners have enhanced and validated our analytic framework and insurance risk rating services
platform, which is now ready for deployment to the wide insurance and financial services
industry.
● API
rollout for market adoption – Our risk rating services platform is built on an application
programming interface (API) structure that is integrated with our partners’ core system,
linked to an underlying data repertoire and analytic framework that facilitates real-time
rating feedback to insurance companies. Regular API upgrades and enhancements enable greater
flexibility in tightening service integration and broadening commercial opportunities with
our partners.
● Official
patent recognition – Over the past two years, Sapientus has been granted eight patents
by the National Copyright Administration of China (NCAC) for the abovementioned model algorithms
and technological infrastructure as well as insurance-oriented applications, for example,
Risk Rating API Design, Insurance Risk Assessment platform and Insurance Fraud Detection
System (one other applications is still pending approval). NCAC is the governing body for
patent and copyright verification and approval in China. The Company’s successful applications
for these patents validate Sapientus’ continuing innovation in data science and its
application in the field of insurance, finance, and beyond, demonstrating the Company’s
active participation and contributions to the industry.

or 750% was mainly due to more consulting and advisory services associated with the Company’s funding activities. The rationale
for rewarding these consultants and advisors with shares is to minimize the usage of cash by the Company to allow the Company to use
the cash to invest in revenue-generating activities.

ended November 30, 2021. This increase resulted from an increase in revenue of $7,943,256 and $118,582 from our Telecommunication Products
& Services and Big Data business, respectively, offset in part by a decrease in revenue of $4,106,125 from our SMS & MMS business.
We principally earn revenue by providing mobile payment and recharge services to customers of telecommunications companies in China.
Specifically, we earn a negotiated rebate amount from the telecommunications companies for all monies paid by consumers to those companies
that we process. The increase in this line of business especially in the mobile recharge revenue was evident as we deployed certain funding
that we had secured in the last few months to this line of business. We plan to continue to develop our mobile recharge business and
expect that revenues would continue to grow further when we continue to deploy more funds. In contrast, our SMS texting service has shown
a drop in revenue as compared to last year. We are facing some challenges in this line of business due to the ongoing Covid outbreak
in China. During the first half year of the last fiscal year, our Big Data division secured a contract with Pacific Life Re, a global
life reinsurance serving the insurance industry with a comprehensive suite of products and services, to develop a holistic multi-faceted
risk rating concept, leveraging the Company’s proprietary approach to analytics by drawing data from novel sources and filtering
them through advance algorithms with the ultimate goal to apply new insights generated from our predictive model to the traditional insurance
industry. In August 2022, after a successful project with Pacific Life Re in Asia, we secured a further contract to advance to the next
phase of collaboration which has contributed to the current revenue recorded.

28, 2022. The increase in the cash reserves is mainly due to the recent funds that we have raised. In order for us to continue to operate
our mobile payment business, we must deposit funds with our telecommunication companies from time to time in order to obtain access to
the mobile data and talk time we make available to consumers on our portal. With the recent funds that we have managed to raise, we have
deployed some of these funds into operations to increase our prepayments and deposits with the telecommunication companies and in return
able to generate a higher revenue. Accordingly, the amount of cash we have on hand fluctuates significantly from period to period as
explained above to ensure our cash is being used efficiently by our operations to generate revenues. The Company otherwise does not have
any planned capital expenditures and has historically funded its operations from revenues and sales of securities, including convertible
debt securities. We believe that our cash on hand, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, along with our revenues from operations,
will fund our projected operating requirements, fund our current operations and repay our outstanding indebtedness, in each case, for
at least the next 12 months. However, to grow our business substantially, we will need to increase the amount of funds we have deposited
with the telecommunications companies for which we process mobile recharge payments. Accordingly, we intend to continue to seek additional
capital through public or private sales of our equity or debt securities, or both. We might also enter into financing arrangements with
commercial banks or non-traditional lenders. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise additional
funding from the sale of our equity or debt securities, or both, in order to increase our deposits with our telecommunications company
clients, or if available, that such funding will be on terms acceptable to us.

ITEM
4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of November 30, 2022. Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based
on such evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, as discussed in
more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not completely
effective as of November 30, 2022. Management has continued to monitor the implementation of the remediation plan described below.

Table of Contents
Material
Weakness
As
previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2022, management concluded that material weaknesses
existed in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we determined that:
●
We
did not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which is applicable to us as a reporting company;
and
●
We
have limited segregation of duties and oversight of work performed as well as lack of compensating controls in the Company’s
finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel. As a result, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible
and may not be economically feasible. Furthermore, we cannot provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with management and director authorization. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions,
the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals.
In
order to remediate the documented material weaknesses, management has implemented corporate governance policies and charters that will
further align the Company’s governance procedures with the requirements noted in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including a Codes of Business
Conduct and Ethics, which reflects the overall corporate principles, policies and values that provides overall guidance for our control
procedures.
Management
is committed to improving our internal control processes and believes that the measures described above should remediate the material
weaknesses identified and strengthen internal control over financial reporting. As we continue to evaluate and improve internal control
over financial reporting, additional measures to remediate the material weaknesses or modifications to certain of the remediation procedures
described above may be necessary. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls
operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
Notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we believe that our consolidated financial
statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the period covered thereby.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except
for the remediation procedures being implemented by the Company as described above, there have been no other changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal
quarter ended November 30, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS
In
addition to the information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, and this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, we have identified the following material risks and uncertainties which reflect our outlook and conditions known
to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report. These material risks and uncertainties should be carefully reviewed by our stockholders
and any potential investors in evaluating the Company, our business and the market value of our common stock. Furthermore, any one of
these material risks and uncertainties has the potential to cause actual results, performance, achievements or events to be materially
different from any future results, performance, achievements or events implied, suggested or expressed by any forward-looking statements
made by us or by persons acting on our behalf. Refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements” as disclosed
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022.
There
is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any one or more of the following material
risks and uncertainties may cause on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, which may result in a significant
decrease in the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these material risks and uncertainties represent
a complete list of the material risks and uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties of a material nature
that, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are unaware of or that we consider immaterial that may become material in the future,
any one or more of which may result in a material adverse effect on us. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment
due to any one of these material risks and uncertainties.
Risks
Related to the Business
We
have a limited operating history and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.
We
have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. You should not rely on our past results of
operations as indicators of future performance. You should consider and evaluate our prospects in light of the risks and uncertainty
frequently encountered by companies like ours.
If
we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those described elsewhere in this “ Risk Factors ”
section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical
financial data and operate in an evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they
would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter
in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing
industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully,
our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected.
We
have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
For
all annual periods of our operating history we have experienced net losses. We generated a net loss of approximately $5.5 million during
the nine months period ended November 30, 2022 and net losses of approximately $4.9 million, $4.3 million and $3.0 million for the years
ended February 28, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$22.6 million and $17.1 million, respectively. We have not achieved profitability, and we may not realize sufficient revenue to achieve
profitability in future periods. Our expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform
features, expand in existing and new markets, increase our sales and marketing efforts and continue to invest in our platform. These
efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we are unable to generate
adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve
or maintain profitability.

If
we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We
are currently experiencing growth in our business. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue
to place, strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources and internal financial
control and reporting functions. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions
into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain,
attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued growth could strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial
and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain
user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our offerings
could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.
The
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, our operations and consumer demand for consumer goods and services remains uncertain,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and on the market price of
our common shares.
In
December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus (now commonly known as COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19
has since spread rapidly throughout many countries, and, on March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada and China, have imposed
unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there have been business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries
that have had significant outbreaks of COVID-19. Although our operating subsidiaries and contractually controlled entity report that
is operation have not been materially affected at this point, significant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our operations and on the global economy as a whole. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last
or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant financial
market volatility and uncertainty in recent weeks. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen
in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial
condition, on the market price of our common shares, and on consumer demand for consumer services, including those offered by our Company.
We
depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate our personnel,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our
success depends in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled
personnel and on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our
organization. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. Our competitors
may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find
suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel,
particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.
Our
concentration of earnings from two telecommunications companies may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
of operations.
We
currently derive a substantial amount of our total revenue through contracts secured with China Unicom and China Mobile. If we were to
lose the business of one or both of these mobile telecommunications companies, if either were to fail to fulfill its obligations to us,
if either were to experience difficulty in paying rebates to us on a timely basis, if either negotiated lower pricing terms, or if either
increased the number of licensed payment portals it permits to process its payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive
position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that the volume of revenue
we earn from China Unicom and China Mobile will remain consistent going forward. Any substantial change in our relationships with either
China Unicom or China Mobile, or both, whether due to actions by our competitors, regulatory authorities, industry factors or otherwise,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any
actual or perceived security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand,
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
business involves the processing and transmission of our users’ personal and other sensitive data. Because techniques used to obtain
unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us, we may be
unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks. Unauthorized parties may in the future gain access to our systems or facilities through
various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of our service providers, partners or users
on our platform, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, service providers, partners, users or others into disclosing names,
passwords, payment information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems,
or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or others into manipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent
transfer of funds to criminal actors. In addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own mobile devices that
are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches
experienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are becoming increasingly common
and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored
or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.
Although
we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users’ data, prevent data loss and prevent other security
breaches, these security measures cannot guarantee security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks
or security breaches; also, employee error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could
result in an actual or perceived privacy or security breach or other security incident.
Any
actual or perceived breach of privacy or security could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable, result in
loss or improper disclosure of data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships
with third-party partners, result in significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of confidence in, or decreased
use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any breach of
privacy or security impacting any entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party providers) could
have similar effects.
Additionally,
defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert
management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities
actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer
will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available
insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible
or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Systems
failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our platform or offerings could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Our
systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software
defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural
disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer
viruses, ransomware, malware or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism,
including by our own employees. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient
for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions
in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.

Table of Contents
We
have not experienced any system failures or other events or conditions that have interrupted the availability or reduced or affected
the speed or functionality of our offerings. These events, were they to occur in the future, could adversely affect our business, reputation,
results of operations and financial condition.
The
successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that
are not under our control.
Our
business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions
in Internet infrastructure or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide
our services and offerings could interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform
users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our
platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have
no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other
charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.
Our
business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem,
such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions
to our services, offerings and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments
may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any
of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate
the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications
systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.
We
may be subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations .
We
may be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings as
our business grows and as we deploy new offerings, including proceedings related to our products or our acquisitions, securities issuances
or business practices. The results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or
regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming,
result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant management attention and divert significant resources.
Determining reserves for litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation.
It is possible that such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These proceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and
brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have
contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and
current and former directors and officers.
We
may require additional funding to support our business.
To
grow our business, FingerMotion currently looks to take advantage of the immense growth in the total mobile services in China. The combined
business revenue in the telecom sector rose 8% year on year to about USD232.43 billion in 2021, with the growth rate up 4.1 percentage
point from 2020. (source:
https://english.news.cn/20220201/da5fa2c2aa614d948e960e7776f84c76/c.html ). For the Company to continue
to grow, the deposit with the Telecoms needs to increase, as most of the revenue we process is dependent on the size of the deposit we
have with each Telecom. We will likely need to raise additional capital to materially increase the amounts of these deposits. If we raise
additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Any debt financing secured by us in the future
could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may
make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. We cannot be certain that additional
funding will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding or funding on terms satisfactory
to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly
limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Claims
by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.
Companies
in the Internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations
of intellectual property rights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual
property rights they own, have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we gain a public profile and the number of competitors in our market
increases, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. From time to time, third parties may assert claims
of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding
companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to assert their intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement
by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our
management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial
amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during
this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing
a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual
property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
With
respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation
of such rights, which may not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating
expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If
a third party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop
alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time (during which we would be unable to continue to offer our
affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Risks
Related to Our Securities
Our
stock has limited liquidity.
Our
common stock began trading on Nasdaq on December 28, 2021, and before that it traded on the OTCQX operated by OTC Markets Group Inc.
Trading volume in our shares may be sporadic and the price could experience volatility. If adverse market conditions exist, you may have
difficulty selling your shares.
The
market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including
the following:
●
actual
or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;
●
changes
in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;
●
changes
in market valuations of other companies, particularly those that market services such as ours;
●
announcements
by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
●
introduction
of product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;
●
departure
of key personnel; and
●
changes
in overall global market sentiments and economy trends.

Table of Contents
We
do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We
have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation
and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders
must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.
If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market
price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.
The
trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
us, our business, our market or our competition. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different
from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, provide a more favorable
recommendation about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would
likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail
to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our common
stock to decline.
The
continued sale of our equity securities will dilute the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders and may decrease the market
price for our common shares.
Our
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 1,000,000 shares
of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our capital stock to provide additional financing
in the future and designate the rights of the preferred shares, which may include voting, dividend, distribution or other rights that
are preferential to those held by the common stockholders. The issuance of any such common or preferred shares may result in a reduction
of the book value or market price of our outstanding common shares. To grow our business substantially, we will likely have to issue
additional equity securities to obtain working capital to deposit with the telecommunications companies for which we process mobile recharge
payments. Our efforts to fund our intended business plans will therefore result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If we do issue
any such additional common shares, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other
stockholders. As a result of such dilution, if you acquire common shares your proportionate ownership interest and voting power could
be decreased. Furthermore, any such issuances could result in a change of control or a reduction in the market price for our common shares.
If
we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce
timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.
As
a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “ SOA ”).
The SOA requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial
reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
- 48 -
Table of Contents
Our
current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business. Further,
weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to
develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results
of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior
periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results
of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be
filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors
to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our common
stock
Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and
sell our shares of common stock, which could depress the price of our shares of common stock.
FINRA
rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for a customer before recommending
that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers
must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and
other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced
securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, if our shares of common stock become speculative low-priced securities,
the FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our shares of common stock, which
may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares of common stock, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares of common stock,
and thereby depress our price per share of common stock.
Our
shares of common stock have been thinly traded, and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your
shares of common stock to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.
Until
December 28, 2021, our shares of common stock were quoted on the OTCQB/QX where they were “thinly-traded”, meaning that the
number of persons interested in purchasing our shares of common stock at or near bid prices at any given time was relatively small or
non-existent. Since we listed on Nasdaq on December 28, 2021, the volume of our shares of common stock traded has increased, but that
volume could decrease until we are thinly-traded again. That could occur due to a number of factors, including that we are relatively
unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales
volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven
company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares of common stock until such time as we became more seasoned.
As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares of common stock is minimal or non-existent,
as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales
without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our shares of common stock may not develop or be
sustained.
Risks
Related to the VIE Agreements
The
PRC government may determine that the VIE Agreements are not in compliance with applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations
JiuGe
Management manages and operates the mobile data business through JiuGe Technology pursuant to the rights its holds under the VIE Agreements.
Almost all economic benefits and risks arising from JiuGe Technology’s operations are transferred to JiuGe Management under these
agreements.
- 49 -
Table of Contents
There
are risks involved with the operation of our business in reliance on the VIE Agreements, including the risk that the VIE Agreements may
be determined by PRC regulators or courts to be unenforceable. Our PRC counsel has advised us that the VIE Agreements are binding and
enforceable under PRC law, but has further advised that if the VIE Agreements were for any reason determined to be in breach of any existing
or future PRC laws or regulations, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such breach, including:
●
imposing
economic penalties;
●
discontinuing
or restricting the operations of JiuGe Technology or JiuGe Management;
●
imposing
conditions or requirements in respect of the VIE Agreements with which JiuGe Technology or JiuGe Management may not be able to comply;
●
requiring
our company to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;
●
taking
other regulatory or enforcement actions that could adversely affect our company’s business; and
●
revoking
the business licenses and/or the licenses or certificates of JiuGe Management, and/or voiding the VIE Agreements.
Any
of these actions could adversely affect our ability to manage, operate and gain the financial benefits of JiuGe Technology, which would
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the PRC government determines
that the contractual arrangements constituting part of our VIE structure do not comply with PRC regulations, or if regulations change
or are interpreted differently in the future, we may be unable to assert our contractual rights over the assets of our VIE, and our shares
of common stock may decline in value or become worthless.
Our
ability to manage and operate JiuGe Technology under the VIE Agreements may not be as effective as direct ownership.
We
conduct our mobile data business in the PRC and generate virtually all of our revenues through the VIE Agreements. Our plans for future
growth are based substantially on growing the operations of JiuGe Technology. However, the VIE Agreements may not be as effective in
providing us with control over JiuGe Technology as direct ownership. Under the current VIE arrangements, as a legal matter, if JiuGe
Technology fails to perform its obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to (i) incur substantial costs and resources
to enforce such arrangements, and (ii) rely on legal remedies under PRC law, which we cannot be sure would be effective. Therefore, if
we are unable to effectively control JiuGe Technology, it may have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives
and grow our revenues.
The
VIE Agreements have never been challenged or recognized in court for the time being, the PRC government may determine that the VIE Agreements
are not in compliance with applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations.
The
VIE Agreements are governed by the PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitral proceedings pursuant to PRC law.
If JiuGe Technology or its shareholders fail to perform the obligations under the VIE Agreements, we would be required to resort to legal
remedies available under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, or claiming damages. We cannot be sure
that such remedies would provide us with effective means of causing JiuGe Technology to meet its obligations or recovering any losses
or damages as a result of non-performance. Further, the legal environment in China is not as developed as in other jurisdictions. Uncertainties
in the application of various laws, rules, regulations or policies in PRC legal system could limit our liability to enforce the VIE Agreements
and protect our interests.

Table of Contents
The
payment arrangement under the VIE Agreements may be challenged by the PRC tax authorities.
We
generate our revenues through the payments we receive pursuant to the VIE Agreements. We could face adverse tax consequences if the PRC
tax authorities determine that the VIE Agreements were not entered into based on arm’s length negotiations. For example, PRC tax
authorities may adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes which could result in our being subject to higher tax liability or
cause other adverse financial consequences.
Shareholders
of JiuGe Technology have potential conflicts of interest with our company which may adversely affect our business.
Li
Li is the legal representative and general manager, and also a shareholder of JiuGe Technology. There could be conflicts that arise from
time to time between our interests and the interests of Ms. Li. There could also be conflicts that arise between us and JiuGe Technology
that would require our shareholders and JiuGe Technology’s shareholders to vote on corporate actions necessary to resolve the conflict.
There can be no assurance in any such circumstances that Ms. Li will vote her shares in our best interest or otherwise act in the best
interests of our company. If Ms. Li fails to act in our best interests, our operating performance and future growth could be adversely
affected.
We
rely on the approval certificates and business license held by JiuGe Management and any deterioration of the relationship between JiuGe
Management and JiuGe Technology could materially and adversely affect our business operations.
We
operate our mobile data business in China on the basis of the approval certificates, business license and other requisite licenses held
by JiuGe Management and JiuGe Technology. There is no assurance that JiuGe Management and JiuGe Technology will be able to renew their
licenses or certificates when their terms expire with substantially similar terms as the ones they currently hold.
Further,
our relationship with JiuGe Technology is governed by the VIE Agreements that are intended to provide us with effective control over
the business operations of JiuGe Technology. However, the VIE Agreements may not be effective in providing control over the application
for and maintenance of the licenses required for our business operations. JiuGe Technology could violate the VIE Agreements, go bankrupt,
suffer from difficulties in its business or otherwise become unable to perform its obligations under the VIE Agreements and, as a result,
our operations, reputations and business could be severely harmed.
If
JiuGe Management exercises the purchase option it holds over JiuGe Technology’s share capital pursuant to the VIE Agreements, the
payment of the purchase price could materially and adversely affect our financial position.
Under
the VIE Agreements, JiuGe Technology’s shareholders have granted JiuGe Management an option for the maximum period of time permitted
by law to purchase all of the equity interest in JiuGe Technology at a price equal to one dollar or the lowest applicable price allowable
by PRC laws and regulations. As JiuGe Technology is already our contractually controlled affiliate, JiuGe Management’s exercising
of the option would not bring immediate benefits to our company, and payment of the purchase prices could adversely affect our financial
position.
Risks
Related to Doing Business in China
Changes
in China’s political or economic situation could harm us and our operating results.
Economic
reforms adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of the country, but the government could
change these economic reforms or any of the legal systems at any time. This could either benefit or damage our operations and profitability.
Some of the things that could have this effect are:
●
Level
of government involvement in the economy;
●
Control
of foreign exchange;
●
Methods
of allocating resources;
●
Balance
of payments position;
●
International
trade restrictions; and
●
International
conflict.

The
Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the
“OECD”), in many ways. For example, state-owned enterprises still constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy and weak
corporate governance and a lack of flexible currency exchange policy still prevail in China. As a result of these differences, we may
not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy was similar to those of the OECD member countries.
Uncertainties
with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.
We
conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiary and affiliate in the PRC. Our principal operating subsidiary
and affiliate, JiuGe Management and JiuGe Technology, are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China
and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court
decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly
enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to
evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations
and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may
be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, most of our executive
officers and all of our directors are not residents of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located
outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the United States or to enforce
a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations, subsidiary and affiliate.
The
current tensions in international trade and rising political tensions, particularly between the United States and China, may adversely
impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Recently
there have been heightened tensions in international economic relations, such as the one between the United States and China. Political
tensions between the United States and China have escalated due to, among other things, trade disputes, the COVID-19 outbreak, sanctions
imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury on certain officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the PRC central government
and the executive orders issued by the U.S. government in November 2020 that prohibit certain transactions with certain China-based companies
and their respective subsidiaries. Rising political tensions could reduce levels of trade, investments, technological exchanges, and
other economic activities between the two major economies. Such tensions between the United States and China, and any escalation thereof,
may have a negative impact on the general, economic, political, and social conditions in China and, in turn, adversely impacting our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regulations were introduced which includes but not limited to Article 177 of
the PRC Securities Law which states that overseas securities regulatory authorities shall not carry out an investigation and evidence
collection activities directly in China without the consent of the securities regulatory authority of the State Council and the relevant
State Council department(s). It further defines that no organization or individual shall provide the documents and materials relating
to securities business activities to overseas parties arbitrarily. With this regulation in force, it may result in delays by the Company
to fulfill any request to provide relevant documents or materials by the regulatory authorities or in the worst-case scenario that the
Company would not be able to fulfill the request if the approval from the regulatory authority of the State Council and the relevant
State Council department(s) were rejected.
You
may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.
We
are a Delaware holding company, but Finger Motion (CN) Limited is a Hong Kong company, and our principal operating affiliate and subsidiary,
JiuGe Technology and JiuGe Management, are located in the PRC. Most of our assets are located outside the United States and most of our
current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries
other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result,
it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you
to enforce in U.S. courts judgments predicated on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our
officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located
outside the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments
of U.S. courts. The recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China
may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between
China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements
that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the
PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide
that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or the public interest. Therefore, it is uncertain
whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.

The
PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.
The
PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through
regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those
relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that
our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local
governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations
that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.
Accordingly,
government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally
planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic
conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties
or joint ventures. Recent statements by the PRC government indicate an intent to take actions to exert more oversight and control over
offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers. Such actions could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline
or become worthless.
The
PRC government may exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based
issuers.
The
PRC government has made recent statements indicating an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted
overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers. Any such action by the PRC government could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value of our securities to significantly
decline or be worthless.
Future
inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China.
In
recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past
ten years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 20.7% and as low as -2.2%. These factors have led to the adoption by the
Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth
and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to
take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company.

Capital
outflow policies in the PRC may hamper our ability to remit income to the United States.
The
PRC has adopted currency and capital transfer regulations. These regulations may require that we comply with complex regulations for
the movement of capital and as a result we may not be able to remit all income earned and proceeds received in connection with our operations
or from the sale of one of our operating subsidiaries to the U.S. or to our shareholders.
Adverse
regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review, and additional disclosure requirements and regulatory
scrutiny to be adopted by the SEC in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments in China may impose additional compliance
requirements for companies like us with significant China-based operations, all of which could increase our compliance costs, subject
us to additional disclosure requirements.
The
recent regulatory developments in China, in particular with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore,
may lead to additional regulatory review in China over our financing and capital raising activities in the United States. In addition,
we may be subject to industry-wide regulations that may be adopted by the relevant PRC authorities, which may have the effect of limiting
our service offerings, restricting the scope of our operations in China, or causing the suspension or termination of our business operations
in China entirely, all of which will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We
may have to adjust, modify, or completely change our business operations in response to adverse regulatory changes or policy developments,
and we cannot assure you that any remedial action adopted by us can be completed in a timely, cost-efficient, or liability-free manner
or at all.
On
July 30, 2021, in response to the recent regulatory developments in China and actions adopted by the PRC government, the Chairman of
the SEC issued a statement asking the SEC staff to seek additional disclosures from offshore issuers associated with China-based operating
companies before their registration statements will be declared effective. On August 1, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission
(the “ CSRC ”) stated in a statement that it had taken note of the new disclosure requirements announced by the SEC
regarding the listings of Chinese companies and the recent regulatory development in China, and that both countries should strengthen
communications on regulating China-related issuers. We cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to tightened regulatory review and
we could be exposed to government interference in China.
Compliance
with China’s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review (revised draft for public consultation), Personal Information
Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other
future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business.
China
has implemented or will implement rules and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China’s
new Data Security Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China in June 2021, or the Data
Security Law, took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based
on “data classification and hierarchical protection system” for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in
China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the
Chinese government. As a result of the new Data Security Law, we may need to make adjustments to our data processing practices to comply
with this law.
Additionally,
China’s Cyber Security Law, requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other
necessary measures to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides
that China adopt a multi-level protection scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security
protection to ensure that the network is free from interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being
disclosed, stolen or tampered. Under the MLPS, entities operating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and
the conditions of their information and network systems to determine the level to which the entity’s information and network systems
belong-from the lowest Level 1 to the highest Level 5 pursuant to the Measures for the Graded Protection and the Guidelines for Grading
of Classified Protection of Cyber Security. The grading result will determine the set of security protection obligations that entities
must comply with. Entities classified as Level 2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for examination
and approval.

Recently,
the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “ CAC ”) has taken action against several Chinese internet companies in
connection with their initial public offerings on U.S. securities exchanges, for alleged national security risks and improper collection
and use of the personal information of Chinese data subjects. According to the official announcement, the action was initiated based
on the National Security Law, the Cyber Security Law and the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, which are aimed at “preventing national
data security risks, maintaining national security and safeguarding public interests.” On July 10, 2021, the CAC published a revised
draft of the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, expanding the cybersecurity review to data processing operators in possession of personal
information of over 1 million users if the operators intend to list their securities in a foreign country.
It
is unclear at the present time how widespread the cybersecurity review requirement and the enforcement action will be and what effect
they will have on the telecommunications sector generally and the Company in particular. China’s regulators may impose penalties
for non-compliance ranging from fines or suspension of operations, and this could lead to us delisting from the U.S. stock market.
Also,
on November 20, 2021, the National People’s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law, which was implemented on November
1, 2021. The law creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information
and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals
in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing
products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The law also proposes that critical information
infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold to-be-set
by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass
a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly, the draft contains
proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of annual revenues from the prior year.
Interpretation,
application and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through
new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. Compliance with the Cyber Security Law and the Data Security
Law could significantly increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or
even prevent us from providing certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in
the future. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection
and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed
on us by the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with
such law or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security
that results in unauthorized access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation
that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties
from contracting with us or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and private
claims or litigation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even
if our practices are not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation
and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by
the Data Security Law and the recent Chinese government actions could materially adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to
raise capital, including engaging in follow-on offerings of our securities in the U.S. market.

Restrictions
on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively.
The
majority of our revenues will be settled in Chinese Renminbi (RMB), and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability
to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars.
Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions,
significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit
foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business.
In addition, conversion of RMB for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval
in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be
certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB.
Fluctuations
in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.
The
value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those currencies
and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S.
dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business
or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be
exchanged into U.S. dollars as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.
Since
July 2005, the RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People’s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign
exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly
in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions
on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.
Very
limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered
into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these
transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange
losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.
Restrictions
under PRC law on our PRC subsidiary’s ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our
ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to our shareholders, and otherwise fund
and conduct our businesses.
Substantially
all of our revenue is earned by JiuGe Management, our PRC subsidiary. PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiary to make
dividends and other payments to its offshore parent company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiary
only out of its accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC
subsidiary is also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance
with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches 50% of our registered capital. Allocations to
these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances or
cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our
ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct
our business.

PRC
regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or
additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary and affiliated entities, which could harm our liquidity and our ability to fund
and expand our business.
As
an offshore holding company of our PRC subsidiary, we may (i) make loans to our PRC subsidiary and affiliated entities, (ii) make additional
capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary, (iii) establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries,
and (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in an offshore transaction. However, most of these uses are subject
to PRC regulations and approvals. For example:
●
loans
by us to our wholly-owned subsidiary in China, which is a foreign-invested enterprise, cannot exceed statutory limits and must be
registered with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC (the “SAFE”) or its local counterparts;
●
loans
by us to our affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, over a certain threshold must be approved by the relevant government
authorities and must also be registered with the SAFE or its local counterparts; and
●
capital
contributions to our wholly-owned subsidiary must file a record with the PRC Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) or its local
counterparts and shall also be limited to the difference between the registered capital and the total investment amount.
We
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or filings on a timely basis, or at all. If we fail to
finish such registrations or filings, our ability to capitalize our PRC subsidiary’s operations may be adversely affected, which
could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.
On
March 30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated a notice relating to the administration of foreign invested company of its capital contribution
in foreign currency into RMB (Hui Fa [2015]19) (“Circular 19”). Although Circular 19 has fastened the administration relating
to the settlement of exchange of foreign-investment, allows the foreign-invested company to settle the exchange on a voluntary basis,
it still requires that the bank review the authenticity and compliance of a foreign-invested company’s settlement of exchange in
previous time, and the settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies shall deposit on the foreign exchange settlement account, and
shall not be used for several purposes as listed in the “negative list”. As a result, the notice may limit our ability to
transfer funds to our operations in China through our PRC subsidiary, which may affect our ability to expand our business. Meanwhile,
the foreign exchange policy is unpredictable in China, it shall be various with the nationwide economic pattern, the strict foreign exchange
policy may have an adverse impact in our capital cash and may limit our business expansion.
Failure
to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC
resident shareholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary
or affiliate, limit our PRC subsidiary’s and affiliate’s ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely
affect us.
In
October 2005, the SAFE, issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through
Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, generally referred to as Circular 75, which required PRC residents to register with
the competent local SAFE branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company (“ SPV ”),
for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of China on the strength of domestic PRC assets originally held by those residents.
Internal implementing guidelines issued by the SAFE, which became public in June 2007 (“ Notice 106 ”), expanded the
reach of Circular 75 by (1) purporting to cover the establishment or acquisition of control by PRC residents of offshore entities which
merely acquire “control” over domestic companies or assets, even in the absence of legal ownership; (2) adding requirements
relating to the source of the PRC resident’s funds used to establish or acquire the offshore entity; covering the use of existing
offshore entities for offshore financings; (3) purporting to cover situations in which an offshore SPV establishes a new subsidiary in
China or acquires an unrelated company or unrelated assets in China; and (4) making the domestic affiliate of the SPV responsible for
the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in connection with any such registration, notably, the business plan which describes
the overseas financing and the use of proceeds. Amendments to registrations made under Circular 75 are required in connection with any
increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, mergers and acquisitions, equity investment or creation of any security interest
in any assets located in China to guarantee offshore obligations and Notice 106 makes the offshore SPV jointly responsible for these
filings. In the case of an SPV which was established, and which acquired a related domestic company or assets, before the implementation
date of Circular 75, a retroactive SAFE registration was required to have been completed before March 30, 2006; this date was subsequently
extended indefinitely by Notice 106, which also required that the registrant establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken
by the SPV and its affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the requirements of Circular
75, as applied by the SAFE in accordance with Notice 106, may result in fines and other penalties under PRC laws for evasion of applicable
foreign exchange restrictions. Any such failure could also result in the SPV’s affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing
their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, or from engaging in other transfers
of funds into or out of China.

We
have advised our shareholders who are PRC residents, as defined in Circular 75, to register with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently
required, in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our PRC subsidiary and affiliate.
However, we cannot provide any assurances that their existing registrations have fully complied with, and they have made all necessary
amendments to their registration to fully comply with, all applicable registrations or approvals required by Circular 75. Moreover, because
of uncertainty over how Circular 75 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether the SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict
how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiary’s and
affiliate’s ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated
borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 75 by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC residents may
not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 75. We also have little control over either
our present or prospective direct or indirect shareholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our PRC resident
beneficial holders or future PRC resident shareholders to comply with Circular 75, if the SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident
beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiary’s
and affiliate’s ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect
our business and prospects.
We
may be subject to fines and legal sanctions by the SAFE or other PRC government authorities if we or our employees who are PRC citizens
fail to comply with PRC regulations relating to employee stock options granted by offshore listed companies to PRC citizens.
On
March 28, 2007, the SAFE promulgated the Operating Procedures for Foreign Exchange Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating
in Employee Stock Ownership Plans and Stock Option Plans of Offshore Listed Companies (“ Circular 78 ”). Under Circular
78, Chinese citizens who are granted share options by an offshore listed company are required, through a Chinese agent or Chinese subsidiary
of the offshore listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures, including applications for foreign exchange
purchase quotas and opening special bank accounts. We and our Chinese employees who have been granted share options are subject to Circular
78. Failure to comply with these regulations may subject us or our Chinese employees to fines and legal sanctions imposed by the SAFE
or other PRC government authorities and may prevent us from further granting options under our share incentive plans to our employees.
Such events could adversely affect our business operations.
Under
the New EIT Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable
tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.
Under
the New EIT Law effective on January 1, 2008, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management bodies” within
China is considered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for
enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the New EIT Law define de facto management as “substantial and overall
management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the enterprise.
On
April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment
Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies (the “ Notice ”),
further interpreting the application of the New EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities.
Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be
classified as a “non-domestically incorporated resident enterprise” if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations
reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in
China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China;
and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would
be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying
dividends to its non-PRC shareholders. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise incorporated
by a Chinese natural person. Nor are detailed measures on imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated resident enterprises are
available. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.

Given
the above conditions, although unlikely, we may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities
determine that we are a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences
could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise
income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source
income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the New EIT Law and its implementing rules
dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiary would qualify as “tax-exempt income,” we cannot guarantee that such dividends
will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have
not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for
PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new “resident enterprise”
classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders
and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC shareholders from transferring our shares. We are actively monitoring the possibility
of “resident enterprise” treatment.
If
we were treated as a “resident enterprise” by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China,
and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax.
We
may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and
any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We
are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials
and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have
operations, agreements with third parties and we earn the majority of our revenue in China. PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government
officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our executive officers, employees,
consultants, sales agents or other representatives of our Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our
policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements
may prove to be less than effective, and the executive officers, employees, consultants, sales agents or other representatives of our
Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result
in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating
results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations
committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.
Because
our business is located in the PRC, we may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls, which we are
required to do in order to comply with U.S. securities laws.
PRC
companies have historically not adopted a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes
strong corporate governance, internal controls and, computer, financial and other control systems. Some of our staff is not educated
and trained in the Western system, and we may have difficulty hiring new employees in the PRC with such training. As a result of these
factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing
financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards. Therefore,
we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of
the SOA. This may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could impact the reliability
of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with Commission rules and regulations and the requirements of the SOA. Any
such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our business.

The
disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public announcements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory
bodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located
in the PRC, where part of our operations and business are located, has conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared
any of our disclosure.
We
are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located
primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in the PRC and Hong Kong. Since substantially
all of our operations and business takes place outside of United States, it may be more difficult for the staff of the SEC to overcome
the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar
companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other
disclosure and public announcements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure
in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the CSRC. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings
and our other public announcements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our Company and with
the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public announcements has been reviewed or otherwise
been scrutinized by any local regulator.
Certain
PRC regulations, including those relating to mergers and acquisitions and national security, may require a complicated review and approval
process which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.
The
Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “M&A Rules”), which became
effective in September 2006 and were further amended in June 2009, requires that if an overseas company is established or controlled
by PRC domestic companies or citizens intends to acquire equity interests or assets of any other PRC domestic company affiliated with
the PRC domestic companies or citizens, such acquisition must be submitted to the MOFCOM, rather than local regulators, for approval.
In addition, the M&A Rules requires that an overseas company controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or citizens and holding
equity interests of PRC domestic companies needs to obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, prior
to listing its securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying
the documents and materials required to be submitted by overseas special purpose companies seeking the CSRC’s approval of their
overseas listings.
The
M&A Rules established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign
investors more time-consuming and complex. For example, the MOFCOM must be notified in the event a foreign investor takes control of
a PRC domestic enterprise. In addition, certain acquisitions of domestic companies by offshore companies that are related to or affiliated
with the same entities or individuals of the domestic companies, are subject to approval by the MOFCOM. In addition, the Implementing
Rules Concerning Security Review on Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, issued by the MOFCOM in November
2011, require that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors in “any industry with national security concerns” be subject
to national security review by the MOFCOM. In addition, any activities attempting to circumvent such review process, including structuring
the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement, are strictly prohibited.
There
is significant uncertainty regarding the interpretation and implementation of these regulations relating to merger and acquisition activities
in China. In addition, complying with these requirements could be time-consuming, and the required notification, review or approval process
may materially delay or affect our ability to complete merger and acquisition transactions in China. As a result, our ability to seek
growth through acquisitions may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if the MOFCOM determines that we should have obtained
its approval for our entry into contractual arrangements with our affiliated entities, we may be required to file for remedial approvals.
There is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such approval from the MOFCOM.
If
the MOFCOM, the CSRC and/or other PRC regulatory agencies subsequently determine that the approvals from the MOFCOM and/or CSRC and/or
other PRC regulatory agencies were required, our PRC business could be challenged, and we may need to apply for a remedial approval and
may be subject to certain administrative punishments or other sanctions from PRC regulatory agencies. The regulatory agencies may impose
fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the conversion and remittance
of our funds in foreign currencies into the PRC, or take other actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock.

As
substantially all of our operations are conducted through the VIE in China, our ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving
distributions of funds from our the VIE. However, the PRC government might exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted
overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, even significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities or dividends to investors, and the value of our common
stock may depreciate significantly or become worthless.
On
July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council
jointly issued the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law (the “ Cracking
Down on Illegal Securities Activities Opinions ”). The Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities Opinions emphasized the
need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision over overseas listings by China-based companies,
and proposed to take measures, including promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to control the risks and deal with
the incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies.
In
addition, on December 24, 2021, the CSRC issued the draft Administration Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas
Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “ Draft Administration Provisions ”) and the draft Administrative
Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “ Draft Administrative Measures ”),
for public comments. The Draft Administration Provisions and the Draft Administrative Measures regulate overseas securities offering
and listing by domestic companies in direct or indirect form. The Draft Administration Provisions specify the responsibilities of the
CSRC to regulate the activities of overseas securities offering and listing by domestic companies and establish a filing-based regime.
As a supporting measure to the Draft Administration Provisions, the Draft Administrative Measures, detail the determination criteria
for indirect overseas listing in overseas markets. Specifically, an offering and listing shall be considered as an indirect overseas
offering and listing by a domestic company if the issuer meets the following conditions: (i) the operating income, gross profit, total
assets, or net assets of the domestic enterprise in the most recent fiscal year was more than 50% of the relevant line item in the issuer’s
audited consolidated financial statement for that year; and (ii) senior management personnel responsible for business operations and
management are mostly PRC citizens or are ordinarily resident in the PRC, or the main place of business is in the PRC or carried out
in the PRC. In accordance with the Draft Administrative Measures, the issuer or its designated material domestic company, shall file
with the CSRC and report the relevant information for its initial public offering.
The
final version and effective date of the Draft Administration Provisions and the Draft Administrative Measures are subject to change with
substantial uncertainty, which may subject us to additional compliance requirement in the future, and we cannot assure you that we will
be able to get the clearance of filing procedures under the Draft Administration Provisions and the Draft Administrative Measures on
a timely manner. Any failure of us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly limit or completely hinder our
ability to offer or continue to offer our securities, cause significant disruption to our business operations, and severely damage our
reputation.
Furthermore,
it is uncertain when and whether we will be required to obtain permission or approval from the PRC government to offer securities to
list on U.S. exchanges or the execution of the VIE Agreement in the future, however, our operations are conducted through the VIE in
PRC, and our ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving distributions of funds from the VIE, if we do not obtain or
maintain any of the permissions or approvals which may be required in the future by the PRC government for the operation of the VIE or
the execution of the VIE Agreements, our operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected, even significantly limit or
completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities or dividends to investors and cause the value of our securities
to significantly decline or become worthless.

The
audit report included in this Annual Report is prepared by an auditor who is not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (the “PCAOB”) and as such, our investors are deprived of the benefits of such inspection. We could be delisted if we
are unable to timely meet the PCAOB inspection requirements established by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCAA”).
As
a public company with securities listed on Nasdaq, we are required to have our financial statements audited by an independent registered
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB. A requirement of being registered with the PCAOB is that if requested by the SEC or
PCAOB, such accounting firm is required to make its audits and related audit work papers be subject to regular inspections to assess
its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Since our auditor is located in Hong Kong and PRC, a jurisdiction where the
PCAOB has been unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities due to various state secrecy laws and the revised
Securities Law, the PCAOB currently does not have free access to inspect the work of our auditor. This lack of access to the PCAOB inspection
in the PRC prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of our auditor based in the PRC. As a result,
the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors
in the PRC makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms’ audit procedures or quality control
procedures as compared to auditors outside of the PRC that are subject to the PCAOB inspections.
On
December 18, 2020, the HFCAA was enacted. In essence, the act requires the SEC to prohibit securities of any foreign companies from being
listed on U.S. securities exchanges or traded “over-the-counter” if a company retains a foreign accounting firm that cannot
be inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, beginning in 2021. Our independent registered public accounting firm is located
in and organized under the laws of Hong Kong and the PRC, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without
the approval of the PRC authorities, and therefore our auditors are not currently inspected by the PCAOB.
On
March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final amendments, which will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register,
relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. The interim final amendments will apply
to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting
firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because
of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. Before any registrant will be required to comply with the interim final amendments,
the SEC must implement a process for identifying such registrants. As of the date of this Annual Report, the SEC is seeking public comment
on this identification process. Consistent with the HFCAA, the amendments will require any identified registrant to submit documentation
to the SEC establishing that the registrant is not owned or controlled by a government entity in that jurisdiction, and will also require,
among other things, disclosure in the registrant’s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and government influence
on, such registrant.
On
June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“ AHFCAA ”) which,
if enacted, would decrease the number of non-inspection years from three years to two, thus reducing the time period before the Company’s
securities may be delisted or prohibited from trading.
On
November 5, 2021, the SEC approved PCAOB Rule 6100, Board Determination Under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountability Act, effective
immediately. The rule establishes “a framework for the PCAOB’s determinations under the HFCAA that the PCAOB is unable to
inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by
an authority in that jurisdiction.”
On
December 2, 2021, SEC has announced the adoption of amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements
in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered
public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate (“ Commission-Identified
Issuers ”). The final amendments require Commission-Identified Issuers to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that,
if true, it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in the public accounting firm’s foreign jurisdiction. The amendments
also require that a Commission-Identified Issuer that is a “foreign issuer,” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4, provide
certain additional disclosures in its annual report for itself and any of its consolidated foreign operating entities. Further, the adopting
release provides notice regarding the procedures the SEC has established to identify issuers and to impose trading prohibitions on the
securities of certain Commission-Identified Issuers, as required by the HFCAA. The SEC will identify Commission-Identified Issuers for
fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2020. A Commission-Identified Issuer will be required to comply with the submission and disclosure
requirements in the annual report for each year in which it was identified. If a registrant is identified as a Commission-Identified
Issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2021, the registrant will be required to comply with the submission
or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering the fiscal year ended December 30, 2022.

On
December 16, 2021, PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the PRC, because of positions
taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. The PCAOB made these determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides a framework
for how the PCAOB fulfills its responsibilities under the HFCAA. The report further listed in its Appendix A and Appendix B, Registered
Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Mainland China Determination and Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Hong Kong Determination,
respectively. The audit report included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, was issued
by Centurion ZD CPA & Co. (“ CZD CPA ”), an audit firm headquartered in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction that the PCAOB
has determined that the PCAOB is unable to conduct inspections or investigate auditors. Our auditors CZD CPA is among those listed by
the PCAOB Hong Kong Determination, a determination announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or
investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency
of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. The lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in PRC prevents
the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors based in PRC. As a result, the investors may be
deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in PRC makes it more
difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms’ audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to
auditors outside of the PRC that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. In addition, under the HFCAA, our securities may be prohibited
from trading on the U.S. stock exchanges or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if our auditor is not inspected by the
PCAOB for three consecutive years, and this ultimately could result in our common stock being delisted. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021,
the U.S. Senate passed the AHFCAA, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities
from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB
inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. In the future, if we do not engage an auditor that is subject to regular inspection
by the PCAOB, our common stocks may be delisted.
In
June 2022, we were identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer on the SEC’s “Conclusive list of issuers identified under
the HFCAA” (available at
https://www.sec.gov/hfcaa ) and, as a result, we will be required to comply with the submission
or disclosure requirements in our annual report covering the fiscal year ending February 28, 2023. If we are so identified for another
two consecutive years, the SEC would prohibit our securities from trading on a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading
market in the United States the earliest in early 2024. If the AHFCAA is passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into
law, such prohibition would take effect the earliest in early 2023.
On
August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance
of the PRC, taking the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered
in mainland China and Hong Kong. The Statement of Protocol gives the PCAOB sole discretion to select the firms, audit engagements and
potential violations it inspects and investigates and put in place procedures for PCAOB inspectors and investigators to view complete
audit work papers with all information included and for the PCAOB to retain information as needed. In addition, the Statement of Protocol
grants the PCAOB direct access to interview and take testimony from all personnel associated with the audits the PCAOB inspects or investigates.
While significant, the Statement of Protocol is only a first step. Uncertainties still exist as to whether and how this new Statement
of Protocol will be implemented. Notwithstanding the signing of the Statement of Protocol, if the PCAOB cannot make a determination that
it is able to inspect and investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, trading
of our securities will still be prohibited under the HFCAA and Nasdaq will determine to delist our securities. Therefore, there is no
assurance that the Statement of Protocol will relieve us from the delisting risk under the HFCAA.

The
SEC may propose additional rules or guidance that could impact us if our auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspection. For example, on
November 6, 2020, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued the Report on Protecting United States Investors from
Significant Risks from Chinese Companies to the then President of the United States. This report recommended that the SEC implement five
recommendations to address companies from jurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to fulfil its statutory
mandate. Some of the concepts of these recommendations were implemented with the enactment of the HFCAA. However, some of the recommendations
were more stringent than the HFCAA. For example, if a company was not subject to PCAOB inspection, the report recommended that the transition
period before a company would be delisted would end on January 1, 2022.
On
November 26, 2022, the PCAOB singed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance
of the PRC to allow the PCAOB to inspect and investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in China and Hong
Kong, consistent with the HFCAA, and that the PCAOB will be required to reassess its determinations by the end of 2022.
The
enactment of the HFCAA and the implications of any additional rulemaking efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information
in PRC could cause investor uncertainty for affected SEC registrants, including us, and the market price of our common stock could be
materially adversely affected. Additionally, whether the PCAOB will be able to conduct inspections of our auditor in the next three years,
or at all, is subject to substantial uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our control. If we are unable to meet the
PCAOB inspection requirement in time, our stock will not be permitted for trading on Nasdaq Capital Market either. Such a delisting would
substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our stock when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with
delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our stock. Also, such a delisting would significantly affect our ability to raise
capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.
