BASIS OF PRESENTATION
OVERVIEW
The
Singing Machine Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”, “SMC”, “The Singing Machine”)
and wholly-owned subsidiaries SMC (Comercial Offshore De Macau) Limitada (“Macau Subsidiary”), SMC Logistics, Inc. (“SMCL”)
and SMC-Music, Inc.(“SMCM”) and SMC (HK) Limited (“SMH”), are primarily engaged in the development, marketing,
and sale of consumer karaoke audio equipment, accessories and musical recordings. Our products are sold directly to distributors and
retail customers.
NOTE

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Controlled
Company
On
June 13, 2022, Ault Alliance, Inc. (“Ault Alliance”), formerly BitNile Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Ault Lending,
LLC (“Ault Lending”), a California limited liability company and subsidiary of Ault Alliance, and Milton C. Ault, III (“Ault”),
Founder and Executive Chairman of Ault Alliance (collectively the “Reporting Persons”) filed a joint Schedule 13D filing
(the “Schedule 13D”) reporting that the Reporting Persons acquired, in the aggregate,
52.8 % of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $ 0.01
per share (the “Common Stock”) of the Company, through open market purchases.
As
disclosed in the Schedule 13D, as amended and Section 16 filings, Ault Lending beneficially owns and Ault Alliance and Ault may be deemed
to beneficially own an aggregate of
1,806,200
shares of the Common Stock (the “Shares”), or approximately
57.3 % of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock as of this filing.
As
these purchases were made in the open market, control of the Company was not assumed from a particular person or group of persons.
Reverse
Stock Split and Nasdaq Listing
On
May 23, 2022, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its shares of common stock in a ratio of 1:30. The reverse stock split was
affected to meet The Nasdaq Capital Market’s minimum bid price requirement. All information in these consolidated financial statements
have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this
1-for-30 reverse stock split .
Our
common stock was approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MICS” and began trading on the Nasdaq
Capital
Market
on May 24, 2022.
Public
Offering
On
May 23, 2022, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Aegis Capital Corp.,
who acted as the sole underwriter (the “Underwriter”), in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to which
the Company sold to the Underwriter
1,000,000
shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $ 4,000,000 , prior to deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses of approximately $ 637,000 . The price to the public in the offering was
$ 4.00
per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering closed on May 26, 2022. The Company received net proceeds
of approximately $ 3,363,000 .
Pursuant
to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to the Underwriter warrants to purchase up to
100,000
shares
of common stock representing
10 % of the Shares sold in the offering, excluding any shares sold through the over-allotment option. The
warrants are exercisable six months from the commencement of sales under the offering, have an exercise price of $ 5.00
per share and
expire
five years
from the date of issuance. The Company estimated the fair value of these warrants to be approximately $ 244,000
using
the Black-Scholes Model based on the following input assumptions: common stock price of $ 2.90 , expected life of the warrants of
3
years;
stock price volatility of
176 %; dividend yield of
0 %; and the risk-free interest rate of
2.63 %.
Stock
Redemption Agreement
On
August 5, 2021, the Company entered into a stock redemption agreement (the “Redemption Agreement”) with koncepts International
Limited (“koncepts”) and Treasure Green Holdings Ltd. (“Treasure Green”) (entities that owned approximately
51 %
of the Company and are principally owned by the Company’s former Chairman, Philip Lau) pursuant to which the Company redeemed
654,105
shares of common stock of the Company (the “Redeemed Shares”). The closing of the transaction set forth in the Redemption
Agreement took place on August 10, 2021, at which time the Redeemed Shares were assigned and transferred back to the Company in consideration
of a payment by the Company of approximately $ 7,162,000
to koncepts and Treasure Green, who no longer have a stake in the Company. The
Redeemed Shares were retired and returned to the unissued authorized capital of the Company.

LIQUIDITY
The
Company reported a net loss of approximately $ 1,653,000
and used cash in operating activities of approximately $ 2,264,000
for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 .
On
October 14, 2022 the Company entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Fifth Third Bank,
National Association, as Lender (“Fifth Third”) replacing the Company’s credit facilities
with
Crestmark Bank and Iron Horse Credit that were terminated by the Company on October 13, 2022 . The
Credit Agreement provides for a three-year secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 15,000,000
decreased
to $ 7,500,000
during the period of January 1 through July 31 of each year. The Credit Agreement matures on October 14, 2025.
As
of December 31, 2022 the Company was in default under the Credit Agreement due to non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio
covenant primarily due to the decrease in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and increased general and administrative
expenses. To date, Fifth Third has not taken action to accelerate the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement and the
Company is currently in negotiations with Fifth Third to obtain a waiver and renegotiate the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. There
can be no assurance that the negotiations will be successful and that Fifth Third will grant the Company a waiver or renegotiate the
covenant.
The
Company expects cash flows from operations as well as other financing resources to be adequate to satisfy working capital requirements
for at least the next twelve months from the date the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company
plans to supplement cash flows from operations from several activities and resources including the following:
●
Continue
to negotiate remediation of the existing default on the Revolving Credit Facility with Fifth Third.
●
Raise
additional cash through equity offering.
●
Utilize
“dynamic discount” programs offered by several of the Company’s major customers which allow for accelerated payment
of invoices in exchange for an early pay discount.
The
Company believes that our cash on hand, working capital (net of cash), cash expected to be generated from our operating forecast, cash
expected to be raised through an equity offering along with the availability of cash from our Credit Agreement with Fifth Third (See
Note 7 –FINANCING) will be adequate to meet the Company’s liquidity requirements for at least twelve months from the date
of this report. While the Company is optimistic that it will be successful in these efforts to achieve our plan, there can be no assurances
that we will be successful in doing so. As such, the Company has a continued support letter from its parent company, Ault Alliance, through
March 31, 2024.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its Macau Subsidiary, SMH, SMCL, and SMCM.
All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation for all periods presented. The accompanying unaudited
financial statements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) applicable to interim financial information and
the requirements of Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and disclosures required by US GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management,
such condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the
fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial position and the condensed consolidated results of operations. The condensed
consolidated results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet information as of March 31, 2022 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with that report.
USE
OF ESTIMATES
The
Singing Machine makes estimates and assumptions in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances, warranty
reserves, inventory reserves and reserves for promotional incentives that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty; therefore, the determination
of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Historically, past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on the Company’s
financial condition. However, circumstances could change which may alter future expectations.

THE
SINGING MACHINE COMPANY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December

(Unaudited)
COLLECTABILITY
OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The
Singing Machine’s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s estimates of the creditworthiness of its
customers, current economic conditions and historical information, and, in the opinion of management, is believed to be in an amount
sufficient to respond to normal business conditions. Management sets
100 % reserves for customers in bankruptcy and other allowances
based upon historical collection experience. The Company is subject to chargebacks from customers for co-op program incentives,
defective returns, return freight and handling
charges that are deducted from open invoices and reduce collectability of open
invoices. Should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the Company, this allowance may
need to be significantly increased, which would have a negative impact on operations.
FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The
functional currency of the Macau and Hong Kong Subsidiaries is the Hong Kong dollar. The financial statements of our subsidiaries are
translated to U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period
for revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are recorded in the statements of
operations and translations would be recorded in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Any such amounts were not material
during the periods presented.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
At
times, the Company maintains cash in United States bank accounts that are more than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured
amounts. The Company also maintains cash balances in foreign financial institutions. The amounts at foreign financial institutions at
December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 are approximately $ 268,000
and $ 172,000 , respectively.
Financial
instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist of accounts receivable.
INVENTORY
Inventories
are comprised primarily of electronic karaoke equipment, microphones and accessories, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value, as determined using the first in, first out method. Inventories also include an estimate for the net realizable value of expected
future inventory returns due to warranty and allowance programs. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 the estimated amounts for
these future inventory returns were approximately $ 1,935,000
and $ 683,000 , respectively. The Company reduces inventory on hand to its
net realizable value on an item-by-item basis when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below
its original cost. A charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net realizable value of specific inventory items declines below
cost. Management regularly reviews the Company’s investment in inventories for such declines in value. As of December 31, 2022
and March 31, 2022 the Company had inventory reserves of approximately $ 761,000
and $ 364,000 , respectively for estimated excess and obsolete
inventory.
LONG-LIVED
ASSETS
The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the related assets are less than the carrying
amount, the carrying amounts are reduced to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360-10-05, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets.” No impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
LEASES
The
Company follows FASB ASC 842, “Leases”. The ASC requires lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet and disclose key
information about leasing arrangements. The standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU
asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than twelve months. Leases are classified as finance
or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. (See Note
8– LEASES).
The
Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments
arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date. The liability is equal to
the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. The asset is based on the liability, subject to certain adjustments. Operating
leases result in straight-line expense (similar to operating leases under the prior accounting standard) while finance leases result
in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to capital leases under the prior accounting standard). As the interest rate implicit in the
Company’s operating leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease
payments. The Company utilizes the financing interest rate for its finance leases.

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation is provided for in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to their estimated useful lives using accelerated
and straight-line methods.
FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We
follow FASB ASC 825, “Financial Instruments”, which requires disclosures of information about the fair value of certain financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. For purposes of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument
is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale
or liquidation.
The
carrying amounts of the Company’s short-term financial instruments, including accounts receivable, due from related party, accounts
payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, refunds due to customers, and due to related party approximates fair value due to the relatively
short period to maturity for these instruments. The carrying amounts on the notes payable, finance leases and installment notes approximate
fair value either due to the relatively short period to maturity or the related interest is accrued at a rate similar to market rates.
The carrying amounts on the revolving line of credit approximates fair value due the relatively short period to maturity and related
interest accrued at market rates.
REVENUE
RECOGNITION AND RESERVE FOR SALES RETURNS
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. All revenue is generated
from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when the goods are delivered and control of the goods sold is transferred
to the customer, in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected
to be entitled in exchange for those goods. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the following five steps: (1) identification
of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract (promised goods or services that are
distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5)
recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of the product or service for each performance obligation.
The
Company selectively participates in a retailer’s co-op promotion incentives to maximize sales of the Company’s products on
the retail floor or to assist in developing consumer awareness of new product launches, by providing marketing fund allowances to our
customers. As these co-op promotion initiatives are not a distinct good or service and the Company cannot reasonably estimate the fair
value of the benefit it receives from these arrangements, the cost of these allowances at the time they are offered to the customers
are recorded as a reduction to net sales. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 co-op promotion incentives were approximately
$ 1,138,000
and $ 796,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 co-op promotion incentives were approximately
$ 2,158,000
and $ 1,805,000 , respectively.
The
Company’s contracts with customers consist of one performance obligation (the sale of the Company’s products). The Company’s
contracts have no financing elements, payment terms are less than 120 days and have no further contract asset or liability obligations
once control of goods is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recorded in the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive
for the sale of these goods.
Costs
incurred in fulfilling contracts with customers include administrative costs associated with the procurement of goods are included in
general and administrative expenses, in-bound freight costs are included in the cost of goods sold and accrued sales representative commissions
are included in selling expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations as our underlying customer agreements
are less than one year.
While
the Company has no overstock return privileges in its vendor agreements with its customers, the Company does provide for variable consideration
contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at the most likely
amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that
a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration
is resolved. The Company estimates variable consideration under our return allowance programs for goods returned from the customer for
various reasons, whereby a sales return reserve is recorded based on historic return amounts, specific events as identified and management
estimates.
The
Company’s reserve for sales returns as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, were approximately $ 2,935,000
and $ 990,000
respectively.

SHIPPING
AND HANDLING COSTS
Shipping
and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods sold to them and are considered activities to
fulfill the Company’s promise to transfer the goods. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 shipping and handling
expenses were approximately $ 177,000
and $ 369,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 shipping and handling
expenses were approximately $ 338,000
and $ 654,000 , respectively. These expenses are classified as a component of selling expenses in
the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.
STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION
The
Company follows the provisions of the FASB ASC 718-20, “Compensation – Stock Compensation Awards Classified as Equity”.
ASC 718-20 requires all share-based payments to employees including grants of employee stock options, be measured at fair value and expensed
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations over the service period (generally the vesting period). The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option valuation model to value stock options. Employee stock option compensation expense for the three and nine months ended December
31, 2022and 2021 includes the estimated fair value of options granted, amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period for the entire portion of the award. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the stock option expense was approximately
$ 77,000
and $ 3,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the stock option expense was approximately $ 163,000
and $ 16,000 , respectively.
RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research
and development costs are charged to results of operations as incurred. These expenses are shown as a component of general and administrative
expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, these amounts
totaled approximately $ 49,000
and $ 11,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, these amounts totaled
$ 107,000
and $ 61,000 , respectively.
INCOME
TAXES
The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of
ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. If it is more likely than not that some portion of
a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized. As of both December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 the
Company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $ 78,000 .
The
Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each interim period and, based on management’s best estimate
of its full year effective tax rate, recognizes cumulative adjustments to its deferred tax assets and liabilities. For the nine months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we estimated our U.S. Federal effective tax rate to be approximately
24 % and
11 %, respectively. As of
December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 the Singing Machine had net deferred tax assets of approximately $ 1,399,000
and $ 893,000 , respectively.
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $ 569,000
and an income tax provision $ 103,000
for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $ 472,000
and an income tax provision
$ 249,000
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The
Company recognizes a liability for uncertain tax positions. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position in a previously filed
tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is
reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. The Company may
recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits
recognized based on the largest benefit that has a
greater
than 50%
likelihood of
being realized
upon ultimate resolution. As of December 31, 2022, there were no uncertain tax positions that resulted in any adjustment to the
Company’s provision for income taxes. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
its provision for income taxes. The Company currently has no liabilities recorded for accrued interest or penalties related to
uncertain tax provisions.

net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution assuming shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of outstanding

price during the period using the treasury stock method. For the three and nine months ended
December

shares of common stock were excluded in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share
as the result would have been anti-dilutive.
RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses”
(Topic 326) . This ASU represents
a significant change in the current accounting model by requiring immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected
credit losses. Under the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred, which delayed recognition of expected losses
that might not yet have met the threshold of being probable.
The
amendments in ASU 2016-03 for smaller reporting companies are effective for the Company beginning April 1, 2023 including interim periods
within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effects of this updated guidance on our
condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

FINANCING
Credit
and Security Agreement with Fifth Third Bank, National Association:
On
October 14, 2022 the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with Fifth Third, as Lender replacing the Company’s credit facilities
with Crestmark Bank (“Crestmark”), a division
of MetaBank National Association (“MetaBank”) and Iron Horse Credit, LLC (“IHC”) that were terminated by the
Company on October 13, 2022 . The Credit Agreement provides for a three-year secured revolving credit
facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 15,000,000
decreased to $ 7,500,000
during the period of January 1 through July 31
of each year. The Credit Agreement matures on
October 14, 2025 .
Costs associated with closing of the Credit Agreement of approximately
$ 254,000
were deferred and are being amortized over a three-year period. During both the three and nine-months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, the Company incurred amortization expense of approximately $ 18,000
and $ 0 , respectively associated with the amortization of
deferred financing costs from the Credit Agreement.
The
revolving credit facility bears interest of (a) the Prime Rate plus
0.50 %
or (b) the 30-day Term SOFR rate plus 3.00% (subject in each case to a floor of
0.50 %),
depending on the type of loan requested by the Company. “Term SOFR” means the forward-looking SOFR rate administered by
CME Group, Inc. (or other administrator selected by Fifth Third) and published on the applicable Bloomberg LP screen page (or such
other commercially available source providing such quotations as may be selected by Fifth Third), fixed by the administrator thereof
two business days
prior to the commencement of the applicable Interest Period (provided, however, that if Term SOFR is not
published for such Business Day, then Term SOFR shall be determined by reference to the immediately preceding Business Day on which
such rate is published), rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/8th of 1% and adjusted for reserves if Fifth Third is required
to maintain reserves with respect to the relevant Loans, all as determined by Lender in accordance with the Credit Agreement and
Fifth Third’s loan systems and procedures periodically in effect. An Unused Line Fee of
0.35 %
per annum of the excess of the Revolving Credit Facility over the average monthly balance of outstanding revolving loans, payable
monthly. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Company and SMC, presently owned or
later acquired, and all cash and non-cash proceeds thereof (including, without limitation, insurance proceeds). During the three and
nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company incurred interest expense of approximately $ 19,000
and
$ 0 , respectfully. As of December 31, 2022 and
March 31, 2022, there was an outstanding balance of approximately $ 1,761,000
and
$ 0 , respectively.
Under
the Credit Agreement:
●
Accounts
Receivable advance rate up to an 85% against eligible Accounts Receivable assuming dilution is under 5% of sales, plus
●
Inventory
advance of up to 85% of the Net Orderly Liquidation Value of eligible inventory as determined by an appraiser satisfactory to Fifth
Third, with a sublimit to be determined based on Fifth Third’ s continuing due diligence. The inventory advance rate will increase
to 95% of the Net Orderly Liquidation Value of eligible inventory from April through June (or another 3-month time frame to be determined
based on Fifth Third’s continuing due diligence) each year to support seasonal working capital needs.
●
The
Company must maintain a Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage of 1.05 to 1.
●
Covenants
may also include reasonable limitations on dividends, distributions, and management fees.
●
The
first Fixed Charge Coverage test will be the period from close to September 30, 2022, building to a trailing twelve months.
As
of December 31, 2022 the Company was in default under the Credit Agreement due to non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio
covenant primarily due to the decrease in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and increased general and administrative
expenses. To date, Fifth Third has not taken action to accelerate the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement and the
Company is currently in negotiations with Fifth Third to obtain a waiver and renegotiate the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. There
can be no assurance that the negotiations will be successful and that Fifth Third will grant the Company a waiver or renegotiate the
covenant.

Intercreditor
Revolving Credit Facility Crestmark Bank and Iron Horse Credit:
On
June 16, 2020, the Company entered into a two-year
Credit
and Security Agreement for a $ 2.5
million financing facility,
with IHC (the “IHC Facility”)
on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Also, on June 16, 2020, the Company entered into a two-year Loan and Security Agreement
for a $ 10.0
million financing facility with Crestmark
(the “Crestmark
Facility”)
on eligible accounts receivable.
Under
the Crestmark Facility:
●
Advance
rate could not exceed 70% of Eligible Accounts Receivable aged less than 90 days from invoice date.
●
Crestmark
maintained a base dilution reserve of 1% for each 1% of dilution over 15%.
●
Crestmark
implemented an availability block of 20% of amounts due on the IHC Facility. See Below
The
Crestmark Facility was secured by a perfected security interest in all assets including a first security interest in accounts receivable
and inventory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crestmark subordinated its first security interest in inventory to IHC as agreed between
all parties. The Crestmark Facility bears interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus
5.50 % with a floor of
8.75 %. Interest and
Maintenance Fees were calculated on the higher of the actual average monthly loan balance from the prior month or a minimum average loan
balance of $ 2.0
million. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded interest expense under the Crestmark
Facility of approximately $ 19,000
and $ 106,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company recorded
interest expense under the Crestmark Facility of approximately $ 151,000
and $ 202,000 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and March
31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding balance on the Crestmark Facility. The Crestmark Facility was terminated on October 13, 2022
and was replaced with the new Credit Agreement with Fifth Third effective October 14, 2022 as outlined above.
Under
the IHC Facility:
●
Advance
rate could not exceed the lower of (a) 70% of the inventory cost or (b) 85% of Net Orderly Liquidation Value (NOLV) as determined
by an independent third-party appraiser engaged by IHC.
●
The
Company was required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio test of 1:1 times measured on a rolling 12-month basis, defined as
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) less non-financed capital expenditures, cash
dividends and distributions paid and cash taxes paid divided by the sum of interest and principal on all indebtedness. The Company
was not in compliance with this covenant as of May 31, 2022; however, a waiver from default was obtained from IHC for this month.
The
IHC Facility was secured by a perfected security interest in the Company’s inventory. The IHC Facility bears interest at
1.292 %
per month or
15.51 % annually. Interest was calculated on the higher of the actual average monthly loan balance from the prior month or
a minimum average loan balance of $ 1,000,000 . Interest expense under the IHC Facility for the three months ended
December
31, 2022
and 2021 was approximately $ 19,000
and $ 34,000 , respectively. Interest expense under the
IHC Facility for the nine months ended
December 31, 2022
and 2021 was approximately $ 213,000
and $ 120,000 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there was an outstanding balance of $ 0
and $ 2,500,000 , respectively.
The IHC Facility was terminated on October 13, 2022 and was replaced with the new Credit Agreement with Fifth Third effective October
14, 2022 as outlined above.
The
total cost to exit the Intercreditor Revolving Credit Facility with Crestmark and IHC was approximately $ 183,000
and was recorded as
a loss from extinguishment of debt as a component of Other (Expenses) Income, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements
of operations.
Note
Payable Payroll Protection Plan
On
May 5, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds from Crestmark in the amount of approximately $ 444,000
under the Paycheck Protection
Program (the “PPP”). The PPP was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which provided
for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The
loans and accrued interest may be forgivable to the extent the Company uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll,
benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness may be reduced if the borrower terminates
employees or reduces salaries during the eligible period. The unforgiven portion of the PPP loan was payable over two years at an interest
rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments until a forgiveness application was accepted and reviewed by the Small Business Administration
(“SBA”), and the SBA provided Crestmark with the loan forgiveness amount. In June 2021 the Company received notification
from the SBA that the loan had been forgiven in its entirety and we were notified by Crestmark that the debt was discharged. For the
nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a gain of approximately $ 0
and $ 448,000
(including principal and interest), respectively
from the forgiveness of the loan was included in other income and expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

of approximately $ 803,000
was converted to a note payable (“subordinated note payable”) which bears interest at
6 %. As part
of the agreement to convert the subordinated debt to a note payable it was agreed that interest expense would be accrued at the same
6 % interest rate on the unpaid principal retroactively from the date that previously scheduled payments had been missed. During the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 interest expense was approximately $ 11,000
and $ 3,000 , respectively on the subordinated note
payable and the related party subordinated debt. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 interest expense was approximately

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
COVID-19
In
January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus
originating in Wuhan, China (“COVID-19”) and the risks to the international community. The WHO declared COVID-19 a global
pandemic on March 11, 2020 and since that time many of the previously imposed restrictions and other measures which were instituted in
response have been subsequently reduced or lifted. However, COVID-19 remains highly unpredictable and dynamic, and its duration and extent
continue to be dependent on various developments, such as the emergence of variants to the virus that may cause additional strains of
COVID-19, the administration and ultimate effectiveness of vaccines, and the eventual timeline to achieve a sufficient level of herd
immunity among the general population. Although the negative effects on the health of the U.S. economy have somewhat subsided, COVID-19
may continue to have negative effects in the future. We have, however, experienced various degrees of manufacturing cost pressures due
to raw material and electronic component shortages, unpredictable variability in both the cost and timing of shipments of materials from
China, as well as inflationary price increases. Although we regularly monitor the financial health and operations of companies in our
supply chain, and use alternative suppliers when necessary and available, any financial hardship or government restrictions on our suppliers
or sub-suppliers caused by any future COVID-19 outbreaks or significant changes in economic conditions such as inflation, including product
and shipping costs, could cause a disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products.
Likewise, logistical supply chain issues could cause delays in the delivery of finished goods. Any of these conditions could adversely
affect our operations.
LEGAL
MATTERS
On
September 11, 2020, a Complaint was filed against the Company’s SMCL subsidiary and various staffing agencies used by SMCL in a
Superior Court of San Bernardino County. The complaint alleges an employee of SMCL committed employment practice violations against a
former temporary employee not employed by us. Management investigated the allegation and engaged an employment attorney to defend the
lawsuit. The complaint sought damages estimated to be no less than $ 500,000
in money judgement.
The
case was referred to arbitration and a settlement agreement was negotiated in favor of the plaintiff and settled for $ 30,000
and the
case dismissed on December 13, 2022.
Other
than as disclosed above, we are not a party to, and our property is not the subject of, any material legal proceedings.

EQUITY
INCENTIVE PLAN
On
April 12, 2022, our Board of Directors approved The Singing Machine Company, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, or the (the “2022
Plan”). The 2022 Plan provides for the issuance of equity incentive awards, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock
awards, restricted stock, stock units, performance awards and other stock or cash-based awards collectively, the “Awards.”
Awards may be granted under the 2022 Plan to the Company’s employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors, and independent
contractors.
The
maximum number of shares of common stock initially available for issuance under the 2022 Plan is 233,333 shares of common stock and thereafter
an annual increase shall be added as of the first day of the Company’s fiscal year beginning in 2023, equal to the least of (i)
5% of the outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the end of the Company’s immediately preceding fiscal year, (ii)
333,334 shares, and (iii) a lesser amount as determined by the Board of Directors. The shares of common stock subject to stock awards
granted under the 2022 Plan that lapse, terminate, expire prior to exercise, are canceled, or are forfeited, shall again become available
for issuance under the 2022 Plan.
The
2022 Plan authorized an aggregate of
233,333
shares of the Company’s common stock available to the Company’s employees, officers,
directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors. As of December 31, 2022 we had issued
107,752
common stock options
and granted common stock of
15,803
under the 2022 Plan leaving
109,778
shares available for issue.
COMMON
STOCK OPTIONS
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued

an exercise price of $ 2.35 , $ 8.11
and $ 7.40
per share, respectively, to directors as compensation for their service.
During

The
fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions
outlined below. The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of our stock and other contributing factors. The expected
term is based upon observation of actual time elapsed between date of grant and exercise of options for all employees. The following
inputs were used to value each option grant:
● For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022: expected dividend yield of
0 %, risk-free interest
rate between
2.63 % and
3.21 %, respectively with volatility between
166.1 % and
176.3 % respectively
with an expected term of
three years .

for a private placement offering of (i)
550,000
shares of its common stock together with Common Warrants to purchase up to
550,000
shares
of common stock with an exercise price of $ 2.80
per share, and (ii)

The

Shares are subject to anti-dilution and other adjustments for certain stock dividends, stock splits, subsequent rights offerings, pro
rata distributions or certain equity structure changes.
Pursuant
to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, on September 3, 2021, the Company filed a registration statement providing for the resale by
the purchasers of the Shares and Warrant Shares sold in the Private Placement, which registration statement became effective on September
15, 2021. Additionally, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company was obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to submit
an application to have the Company’s common stock listed on a national exchange by December 31, 2021, and to use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Shares and Warrant Shares listed on such national exchange as soon as practicable following the submission of
such application. As indicated, the Common Stock was approved to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MICS”
and began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on May 24, 2022.

interest in the Company. Stingray is a long-standing business partner with the Company that provides our customers with music content
from their library of produced and licensed karaoke content and is now a related party (see Note 14 - Related Party Transactions).
In
connection with the Private Placement, on July 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Placement Agency Agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global
Partners (“AGP”), which provided for AGP to serve as the exclusive placement agent, advisor or underwriter (the “placement
agent services”). Pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, upon closing of the Private Placement, the Company paid AGP placement
fees of $ 630,000
( representing 7% of the gross proceeds raised in the Private Placement excluding proceeds raised from the strategic
investor, plus 3.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from the strategic investor ), and issued AGP warrants to purchase
44,445
shares
of the Company’s common stock (the “Advisor Warrants”) (representing
5 % of the aggregate number of Shares and Pre-Funded
Warrants sold in the Private Placement, excluding the Shares sold to the strategic investor). The Advisor Warrants have the same exercise
price ($ 2.80 ) and terms as the Common Warrants issued in the Private Placement. The Company estimated the fair value of the Advisor Warrants
to be approximately $ 359,000
using the Black-Scholes Model based on the following input assumptions: common stock price of $ 9.90 , expected
life of the warrants of
2.5
years; stock price volatility of
168 %; dividend yield of
0 %; and the risk-free interest rate of
2.65 %.
In
addition to the placement fees paid to AGP, the Company incurred additional offering costs for direct incremental legal, consulting,
accounting and filing fees related to the Private Placement of approximately $ 390,000 , of which one consultant was issued
1,905
shares
of restricted common stock with an aggregate fair value of approximately $ 189,000
and a cash payment of $ 100,000 . Total offering costs
related to the Private Placement amounted approximately $ 831,000

have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this
1-for-30 reverse stock split .
On
May 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Underwriting Agreement with Aegis Capital Corp., who acted as the sole Underwriter, in a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to which the Company sold to the Underwriter

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND SALES RISK
The
Company derives a majority of its revenues from retailers of products in the United States. The Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts is based upon management’s estimates and historical experience and reflects the fact that accounts receivable are concentrated

At December 31, 2022, approximately
77 % of accounts receivable were due from three customers in North America that individually owed
over 10% of total accounts receivable. At March 31, 2022,
53 % of accounts receivable were due from four customers in North America that
individually owed over 10% of total accounts receivable.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
The
objective of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation is to allow investors to
view the Company from management’s perspective, considering items that would have a material impact on future operations.
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere
in this quarterly report. This document contains certain forward-looking statements including, among others, anticipated trends in our
financial condition and results of operations and our business strategy. (See Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors “). These forward-looking
statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could
differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Statements
included in this quarterly report that do not relate to present or historical conditions are called “forward-looking statements.”
Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may
include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Words such as “believes,”
“forecasts,” “intends,” “possible,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,”
“plans,” “should,” “could,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict or project future results or the effect of events on our operating results is inherently
uncertain. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be
accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.
Important
factors to consider in evaluating such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in external factors or
in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations; (ii) unanticipated working capital or other
cash requirements; (iii) changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the
industries in which we operate; and (iv) the effects of adverse general economic conditions, both within the United States and globally,
(v) vendor price increases and decreased margins due to competitive pricing during the economic downturn (vi)various competitive market
factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace and (vii) other factors described in the risk factors section
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, this Quarterly Report on 10-Q, or in our other filings made with the SEC.
Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s opinions only as of the
date hereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements.
OVERVIEW
The
Singing Machine Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company,” “SMC”, “The Singing Machine”),
and wholly-owned subsidiaries SMC (Comercial Offshore De Macau) Limitada (“Macau Subsidiary”), SMC Logistics, Inc. (“SMCL”),
SMC-Music, Inc. (“SMCM”) and SMC (HK) Limited (“SMH”), are primarily engaged in the development, marketing, and
sale of consumer karaoke audio equipment, accessories and musical recordings. The products are sold directly to distributors and retail
customers.
Our
products are sold throughout North America, Europe and Australia primarily through major mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, on-line
retailers and to a lesser extent department stores, lifestyle merchants, direct mail catalogs and showrooms, music and record stores,
and specialty stores.
Representative
customers include Amazon, Best Buy, BJ’s Wholesale, Costco, Sam’s Club, Target, and Wal-Mart. Our business has historically
been subject to seasonal fluctuations causing our revenues to vary from quarter to quarter and between the same periods in different
fiscal years. Our products are manufactured for the most part based on the purchase indications of our customers. We are uncertain of
how significantly our business would be harmed by a prolonged economic recession, but we anticipate that continued contraction of consumer
spending would negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.
Sales
of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during
the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season, which includes Christmas. A substantial majority of
our sales occur during the second quarter ending September 30 and the third quarter ending December 31. Sales in our second and third
quarter, combined, accounted for approximately 81% and 86% of net sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Unfavorable
global or regional economic conditions may be triggered by numerous developments beyond our control, including the recent inflation in
the United States, geopolitical events, health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events that trigger economic volatility
on a global or regional basis. Those types of unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.
In particular, a significant deterioration in economic conditions, including economic slowdowns or recessions, increased unemployment
levels, inflationary pressures or disruptions to credit and capital markets, could lead to decreased consumer confidence and consumer
spending more generally, thus reducing consumer demand for our products. We are also impacted by our entire supply chain. While we have
experienced a significant decrease in container costs for inbound containers due to decreased demand in general, we are continuing to
see increases in drayage costs due to cost of fuel increases and other surcharges due to inflation. The cost of labor, employee benefits,
pallets and warehouse supplies and other logistics related costs continue to increase at record rates. Such heightened inflationary levels
may negatively impact consumer disposable income and discretionary spending and, in turn, reduce consumer demand for our products and
increase our costs.

QUARTER
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021
NET
SALES
Net
sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased to approximately $7,111,000 from approximately $21,244,000, a decrease of
approximately $14,133,000 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. We experienced a decrease in net sales to all of our
major customers compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net sales was largely due to two main factors:
(1) our major customers began the holiday season with excess inventory that was held over from the previous year due to late delivery
of shipments caused by significant supply chain issues experienced during the end of calendar year 2021 and early 2022 and (2) the news
of economic recession, runaway inflation, and interest rate hikes dampened customers’ expectations
for the holiday season which resulted in customers taking a very risk-adverse approach to buying and carrying inventory. Most of our
customers either did not take some of the inventory they had committed to earlier in the year or required significant co-op promotion
incentives on goods sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Co-op promotion incentives for the three months ended December
31, 2022 increased to approximately $1,138,000 or 16.0% of net sales as compared to approximately $795,000 or 3.7% of net sales for the
three months ended December 31, 2021.
GROSS
PROFIT
Gross
profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased to approximately $1,291,000 from approximately $5,309,000 a decrease of
approximately $4,018,000 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net sales as explained in Net Sales
above accounted for approximately $3,532,000 of the decrease with the remaining decrease due to a decrease in gross profit margin.
Gross
profit margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 18.1% compared to 25.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2021,
a decrease of 6.9 margin points. Co-op promotion incentives, as explained in Net Sales above, accounted for approximately $342,000 or
4.8 margin points of the gross margin decrease and there was an increase in inventory reserves of approximately $246,000 or 3.5 points
of the gross margin decrease. These decreases were offset by approximately $102,000 or 1.5 margin point increase primarily due to lower
landed product costs from decreased costs of shipping containers compared to the previous year.
23
OPERATING
EXPENSES
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, total operating expenses decreased to approximately $3,573,000 compared to approximately $3,616,000
during the three months ended December 31, 2021. This represents a decrease in total operating expenses of approximately $43,000 from
the three months ended December 31, 2022. There was a decrease in selling expenses of approximately $281,000 primarily due to the decrease
in sales as discussed in Net Sales offset by an increase of approximately $240,000 in general and administrative expenses.
General
and administrative expenses increased to approximately $2,395,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to approximately
$2,155,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $240,000. There was an increase in compensation
expense of $400,000 related to a change of control and employment continuation agreement with the Chief Financial Officer. There was
an increase in legal and professional expenses of approximately $164,000 which were primarily related to legal and professional costs
associated with the arbitration settlement of the alleged employment practice violation lawsuit against a former temporary employee and
other regulatory filings. These increases were offset by decreases in bad debt and repair reserves of approximately $388,000 with the
remaining variance due to net reductions of other variable expenses.
(LOSS)
INCOME FROM OPERATIONS
There
was a loss from operations of approximately $2,282,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to income from operations
of approximately $1,694,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in income from operations of approximately $3,976,000
was primarily due to the decrease in net sales and gross profit as explained above.
OTHER
EXPENSES
Other
expenses increased by approximately $55,000 to approximately $220,000 in other expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022
compared to approximately $165,000 in other expenses, net for the three months ended December 31, 2021. During the three months ended
December 31, 2022, there was a fee of approximately $183,000 for exiting the
Intercreditor Revolving
Credit Facility with Crestmark and IHC (See Note 7 – Financing) that was recorded as a loss from extinguishment of debt. This expense
was offset by a decrease in interest expense of approximately $88,000 due to a more favorable interest rate with the new financing arrangement
and a gain of approximately $49,000 from the forgiveness of accounts payable by Starlight R&D, Ltd and Starlight Consumer Electronics
Co. Ltd. who were former related parties.
INCOME
TAXES
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $569,000 and an income
tax provision of approximately $103,000, respectively, due to management’s best estimate of the Company’s full year effective
tax rate of approximately 24% and 11%, respectively.
NET
(LOSS) INCOME
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 there was a net loss of approximately $1,653,000 compared to net income of approximately $1,426,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the same reasons discussed in (Loss) Income
from Operations.
NINE
MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021
NET
SALES
Net
sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased to approximately $35,916,000 from approximately $44,679,000, a decrease of
approximately $8,763,000 as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. We experienced a decrease in net sales to all of our
major customers compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net sales was largely due to two main factors: (1)
our major customers began the holiday season with excess inventory that was held over from the previous year due to late delivery of
shipments caused by significant supply chain issues experienced during the end of calendar year 2021 and early 2022 and (2) the news
of economic recession, runaway inflation,
and interest rate hikes dampened customers’ expectations
for the holiday season which resulted in customers taking a very risk-adverse approach to buying and carrying inventory. Most of our
customers either did not take some of the inventory they had committed to earlier in the year or required significant co-op promotion
incentives on goods sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Co-op promotion incentives for the nine months ended December
31, 2022 increased to approximately $2,158,000 or 6.0% of net sales as compared to approximately $1,805,000 or 4.0% of net sales for
the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
24
GROSS
PROFIT
Gross
profit for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased to approximately $8,435,000 from approximately $10,215,000 a decrease of
approximately $1,780,000 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net sales as explained in Net Sales above
accounted for approximately $2,003,000 of the decrease offset by an increase in gross profit margin contribution of approximately $223,000.
Gross
profit margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was 23.5% compared to 22.9% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, an
increase of 0.6 gross margin points. There were increases in gross profit margin of approximately $1,234,000 or 3.4 margin points due
to price increases and decreased landed costs for products due to decreasing costs of shipping container costs. These increases in gross
profit margin were offset by gross profit margin decreases of approximately $353,000 or 1.0 margin points due to co-op promotion incentives
as explained in Net Sales above and an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserves of approximately $658,000 or 1.8 margin points
of the gross margin decrease.
OPERATING
EXPENSES
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, total operating expenses increased to approximately $9,986,000 compared to approximately $8,261,000
during the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This represents an increase in total operating expenses of approximately $1,725,000 from
the nine months ended December 31, 2021. There was an increase of approximately $1,830,000 in general and administrative expenses offset
by a decrease in selling expenses of approximately $88,000 primarily due to the decrease in sales as discussed in Net Sales above.
General
and administrative expenses increased to approximately $7,183,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to approximately
$5,353,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1,830,000. There was an increase in legal, professional,
investor relations and stock transfer costs of approximately $601,000 primarily related to the public offering, Nasdaq up-listing, change
in control issues, regulatory filings and preparation costs relating to the Credit Agreement with Fifth Third and arbitration settlement
of the alleged employment practice violation lawsuit against a former temporary employee. There was an increase in compensation of approximately
$517,000 primarily due to compensation for new members of the board of directors, and officers’ and employees’ incentive
compensation, new hires as well as merit increases. There was an increase in compensation expense of $400,000 related to a change of
control and employment continuation agreement with the Chief Financial Officer. There was an increase in travel expenses of approximately
$153,000 which includes the participation in the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas which we had not attended since the beginning
of COVID-19. There were inflationary expenses increases of approximately $112,000 in our California warehouse operations with the remaining
increase due to other expenses that have increased due to inflation.
(LOSS)
INCOME FROM OPERATIONS
There
was a loss from operations of approximately $1,551,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to income from operations
of approximately $1,954,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in income from operations of approximately $3,505,000
was primarily due to the decrease in net sales and gross profit and increase in general and administrative expenses as explained above.
OTHER
(EXPENSES) INCOME
Other
expenses, net increased by approximately $868,000 to approximately $574,000 in other expenses, net for the nine months ended December

ended December 31, 2022, there was a fee of approximately $183,000 for exiting the

a previous year’s damaged goods
incident.

For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $472,000 and an income tax

the nine months ended December 31, 2022 there was a net loss of approximately $1,653,000 compared to net income of approximately $2,000,000
for the same period a year ago. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the same reasons discussed in (Loss) Income from Operations,
Other (Expense) Income and Income Taxes.
LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $2,795,000 as compared to cash on hand of approximately $7,375,000
on December 31, 2021. We had working capital of approximately $10,473,000 as of December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities
was approximately $2,264,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 there was an
increase in accounts receivable of approximately $4,255,000 due to a seasonal increase in net sales and a seasonal decrease in accounts
payable of approximately $3,258,000 primarily due to payment of factory invoices. These increases in net cash used in operating activities
were offset by a seasonal decrease in inventory of approximately $2,780,000 and an increase in accrued expenses of approximately $1,502,000
primarily due to the increase in co-op promotion incentives granted to customers during the third quarter ended December 31, 2022. There
was an increase in reserve for sales returns of approximately $1,945,000 which included an additional reserve of approximately $1,300,000
for anticipated overstock returns from one customer.
Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately $3,113,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. During the nine months ended
December 31, 2021 there was an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $10,124,000 due to a seasonal increase in sales and an
increase in inventories of approximately $5,933,000 due to in-transit and receipt of inventory intended for peak season shipments but
were received too late to ship due to global logistics issues. These increases in net cash used in operating activities were offset by
an increase in in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $4,531,000 due to delayed receipt of seasonal purchases of product
for the peak season due to global logistics issues. There was a decrease in amounts due from Crestmark Bank of approximately $4,557,000
as cash collected in excess of amounts due on the revolving credit during the first quarter was used to pay for the seasonal increase
in inventory. There was a seasonal increase in reserve for sales returns of approximately $1,962,000.
Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $149,000 as compared to approximately
$78,000 used in investing activities for the same period ended a year ago and consisted primarily of purchases of molds and tooling for
new products.
Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $3,101,000 compared to cash
provided by financing activities of approximately $10,170,000 for the same period ended of the prior year. In May 2022, we received
net proceeds of approximately $3,363,000 from the public offering we executed in conjunction with our up-listing to Nasdaq as
summarized in the next two paragraphs. In addition, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we received proceeds of
approximately $1,144,000 from the exercise of pre-funded and common stock warrants. All proceeds were used for working capital. In
October 2022, we exited our financing facility with Crestmark and IHC and entered into a new financing arrangement with Fifth Third
Bank. We incurred an exit fee of approximately $183,000 for early termination of the financing facility with Crestmark and IHC. We
used net proceeds of approximately $1,345,000 from the new financing agreement to pay the subordinated debt to a former related
party of approximately $353,000, closing costs of approximately $254,000, the remaining used to settle amounts due on the prior
financing.
On
May 23, 2022, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Aegis Capital Corp.,
who acted as the sole underwriter (the “Underwriter”), in a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the “Offering”)
pursuant to which the Company sold to the Underwriter 1,000,000 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the “Common Stock”) for gross proceeds of $4,000,000 prior to deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
other estimated offering expenses of approximately $637,000. The price to the public in the Offering was $4.00 per Share, before underwriting
discounts and commissions. The offering closed on May 26, 2022. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $3,363,000 which was
used for working capital.
On
May 24, 2022, the Company’s Common Stock was approved to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MICS”
and began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on May 24, 2022.
On
October 14, 2022 the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with Fifth Third, as Lender replacing the existing credit facilities
with Crestmark Bank and Iron Horse Credit that were terminated by the Company on October 13, 2022 .
The Credit Agreement provides for a three-year secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15,000,000
decreased to $7,500,000 during the period of January 1 through July 31 of each year. The Credit Agreement matures on October 14, 2025.
As
of December 31, 2022 the Company was in default under the Credit agreement due to non-compliance with the fixed charge ratio
covenant primarily due to the decrease in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and increased general and
administrative expenses. To date, Fifth Third has not taken action to accelerate the Company’s obligations under the Credit
Agreement and the Company is currently in negotiations with Fifth Third to obtain a waiver and renegotiate the fixed charge coverage
ratio covenant. There can be no assurance that the negotiations will be successful and that Fifth Third will grant the Company a
waiver or renegotiate the covenant.
As
of this filing there was no outstanding balance on the Credit Agreement.
26
The
Company expects cash flows from operations as well as other financing resources to be adequate to satisfy working capital requirements
for at least the next twelve months from the date the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company
plans to supplement cash flows from operations from several activities and resources including the following:
● Continue
to negotiate remediation of the existing default on the Revolving Credit Facility with Fifth
Third.
● Raise
additional cash through equity offering.
● Utilize
“dynamic discount” programs offered by several of the Company’s major customers
which allow for accelerated payment of invoices in exchange for an early pay discount.
The
Company believes that our cash on hand, working capital (net of cash), cash expected to be generated from our operating forecast, cash
expected to be raised with our ATM offering along with the availability of cash from our Credit Agreement with Fifth Third (See Note
7 –FINANCING) will be adequate to meet the Company’s liquidity requirements for at least twelve months from the date of this
report. While the Company is optimistic that it will be successful in these efforts to achieve our plan, there can be no assurances that
we will be successful in doing so. As such, the Company has a continued support letter from its parent company, Ault Alliance, through
March 31, 2024.
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The
Company’s interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles,
which require management to make subjective decisions, assessments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the judgement increases such judgements become even more subjective. While management
believes that its assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, actual results may be materially different than estimated. The critical
accounting estimates and assumptions have not materially changed from those identified in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report.
ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not
required for small reporting companies.
ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b)
Changes in Internal Controls
There
were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that materially
affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On
September 11, 2020, a Complaint was filed against the Company’s SMCL subsidiary and various staffing agencies used by SMCL in a
Superior Court of San Bernardino County. The complaint alleges an employee of SMCL committed employment practice violations against a
former temporary employee not employed by us. Management investigated the allegation and engaged an employment attorney to defend the
lawsuit. The complaint sought damages estimated to be no less than $500,000 in money judgement.
The
case was referred to arbitration and a settlement agreement was negotiated in favor of the plaintiff and settled for $30,000 and the
case was dismissed on December 13, 2022.
As
of this filing, management is not aware of any legal proceedings other than matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
