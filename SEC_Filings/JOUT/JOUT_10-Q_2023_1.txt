NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1     BASIS OF PRESENTATION The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the financial position of Johnson Outdoors Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and their results of operations for the three month periods then ended and cash flows for the three month periods then ended. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 9, 2022. Due to seasonal variations and other factors, some of which are described herein, including related to the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing related disruptions to the global supply chains and logistics infrastructure, and the current inflationary environment (especially as it relates to the cost of raw materials and purchased components), the results of operations for the three months ended December 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the Company’s full 2023 fiscal year.  The current economic and business environment, including as it relates to inflationary pressures, combined with the continued impact of the pandemic on the global supply chain (specifically with respect to the sourcing, timing, availability and cost of raw materials and components that are necessary to manufacture our products) is beyond our control and remains highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
See “Seasonality” and "Coronavirus (COVID-19)" in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere herein for additional information. The Company considers all short-term investments in interest-bearing accounts and all securities and other instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, to be equivalent to cash.
Cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates market value.
All monetary amounts, other than share and per share amounts, are stated in thousands. 2     ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $ 1,151 , $ 1,037
and $ 2,662
as of December 30, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in net accounts receivable to $ 120,553
as of December 30, 2022 from $ 91,919
as of September 30, 2022 is attributable to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business. The determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where specific collection concerns about a receivable exist, a reserve is established to value the affected account receivable at an amount the Company believes will be collected. For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of accounts receivable outstanding for each business segment. Uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after collection efforts have been exhausted. The Company typically does not require collateral on its accounts receivable. 3     EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) Net income or loss per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is computed using the two-class method.  Grants of restricted stock which receive non-forfeitable dividends are classified as participating securities and are required to be included as part of the basic weighted average share calculation under the two-class method. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cash dividends equal to
110 % of all dividends declared and paid on each share of Class B common stock. The Company grants shares of unvested restricted stock in the form of Class A shares, which carry the same distribution rights as the Class A common stock described above.  As such, the undistributed earnings for each period are allocated to each class of common stock based on the proportionate share of the amount of cash dividends that each such class is entitled to receive.   Basic EPS Basic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss allocated to Class A common stock and Class B common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common
- 6 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. stock outstanding, respectively.  In periods with cumulative year to date net income and undistributed income, the undistributed income for each period is allocated to each class of common stock based on the proportionate share of the amount of cash dividends that each such class is entitled to receive.  In periods where there is a cumulative year to date net loss or no undistributed income because distributions through dividends exceed net income, Class B shares are treated as anti-dilutive and, therefore, net losses are allocated equally on a per share basis among all participating securities. For the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, basic income per share for the Class A and Class B shares has been presented using the two class method and reflects the allocation of undistributed income described above.
Diluted EPS Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing allocated net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options, restricted stock units (“stock units” or “units”) and non-vested restricted stock.  Anti-dilutive stock options, units and non-vested stock are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.  The computation of diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes that Class B common stock is converted into Class A common stock.  Therefore, diluted net income per share is the same for both Class A and Class B common shares.  In periods where the Company reports a net loss, the effect of anti-dilutive stock options and units is excluded and diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share for both classes of stock. For the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, diluted net income per share reflects the effect of dilutive stock units and assumes the conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock.
Shares of non-vested stock that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future which were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been anti-dilutive totaled
60,390
and
37,916
for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Stock units that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future and which were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been anti-dilutive were
53,699
and
26,232
for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Dividends per share Dividends per share for the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows:   Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Dividends declared per common share: Class A $ 0.31   $ 0.30   Class B $ 0.28   $ 0.27   4     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS The Company’s current stock ownership plans allow for issuance of stock options to acquire shares of Class A common stock by key executives and non-employee directors. Current plans also allow for issuance of shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock appreciation rights in lieu of stock options. Under the Company’s 2012 Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Plan and the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the only plans where shares currently remain available for future equity incentive awards) there were a total of
395,018
shares of the Company’s Class A common stock available for future grant to non-employee directors and key executives at December 30, 2022.
Share awards previously made under the Company's 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, which no longer allows for additional share grants, also remain outstanding.
Non-vested Stock - 7 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. All shares of non-vested restricted stock awarded by the Company have been granted in the form of shares of Class A common stock at their fair market value on the date of grant and vest within
one year
from the date of grant for stock granted to directors and
four years
from the date of grant for stock granted to officers and employees.  The fair value at date of grant is based on the number of shares granted and the average of the Company’s high and low Class A common stock price on the date of grant or, if the Company’s Class A shares did not trade on the date of grant, the average of the Company’s high and low Class A common stock price on the last preceding date on which the Company’s Class A shares traded. A summary of non-vested stock activity for the three months ended December 30, 2022 related to the Company’s stock ownership plans is as follows:   Shares Weighted Average Grant Price Non-vested stock at September 30, 2022 58,136   $ 73.37   Non-vested stock grants 16,143   56.55   Restricted stock vested ( 7,350 ) 71.43   Non-vested stock at December 30, 2022 66,929   69.52     Non-vested stock grantees may elect to reimburse the Company for withholding taxes due as a result of the vesting of shares by tendering a portion of the vested shares back to the Company.  Shares tendered back to the Company were
2,289
and
1,778
during the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Stock compensation expense, net of forfeitures, related to non-vested stock was $ 456
and $ 295
for the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock as of December 30, 2022 was $ 2,938 , which amount will be amortized to expense through December 2026 or adjusted for changes in future estimated or actual forfeitures. The fair value of restricted stock vested during the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 429
and $ 573 , respectively. Restricted Stock Units All restricted stock units (RSUs) awarded by the Company have been granted in the form of units payable in shares of Class A common stock upon vesting.
The units are valued at the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the date of grant and vest within
one year
from the date of grant for RSUs granted to directors, subject to satisfaction of applicable performance criteria, and
three years
from the date of grant for RSUs granted to employees.  The fair value at the date of grant is based on the number of units granted and the average of the Company’s high and low Class A common stock trading price on the date of grant or, if the Company’s Class A shares did not trade on the date of grant, the average of the Company’s high and low Class A common stock trading price on the last preceding date on which the Company’s Class A shares traded. A summary of RSU activity for the three months ended December 30, 2022 follows:   Number of RSUs Weighted Average Grant Price RSUs at September 30, 2022 65,994   $ 82.58   RSUs granted 36,484   56.54   RSUs vested ( 26,742 ) 64.51   RSUs at December 30, 2022 75,736   76.42     Stock compensation expense, net of forfeitures, related to RSUs was $ 476
and $ 727
for the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs as of December 30, 2022 was $ 3,175 , which amount will be amortized to expense through September 2025 or adjusted for changes in future estimated or actual forfeitures. - 8 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. RSU grantees may elect to reimburse the Company for withholding taxes due as a result of the vesting of units and issuance of unrestricted shares of Class A common stock by tendering a portion of such unrestricted shares back to the Company.
Shares tendered back to the Company for this purpose were
5,055
and
2,799
during the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock units recognized as a tax deduction during the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 2,247
and $ 2,759 , respectively.
Compensation expense related to units earned by employees (as opposed to grants to outside directors) is based upon the attainment of certain Company financial goals related to cumulative net sales and cumulative operating profit over a
three-year
performance period.
Awards are only paid if at least
80 % of the target levels are met and maximum payouts are made if
120 % or more of target levels are achieved.
The payouts for achievement at the threshold levels of performance are equal to
50 % of the target award amount.
The payouts for achievement at maximum levels of performance are equal to
150 % of the target award amount.
To the extent earned, awards are issued in shares of Company Class A common stock after the end of the
three-year
performance period. Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan The Company’s shareholders have adopted the Johnson Outdoors Inc. 2009 Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan, which was most recently amended on March 2, 2017, and which provides for the issuance of shares of Class A common stock at a purchase price of not less than
85 % of the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant or on the date of purchase, whichever is lower. During the three month period ended December 30, 2022, the Company issued
0
shares of Class A common stock and recognized $ 21
of expense in connection with the Employees' Stock Purchase Plan.
During the three month period ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued
0
shares of Class A common stock and recognized $ 104
of expense in connection with the Plan.
5     LEASES The Company leases certain facilities and machinery and equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases.
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
As of December 30, 2022, the Company had approximately
200
leases, with remaining terms ranging from less than
one year
to
16
years.
Some of the leases contain variable payment terms, such as payments based on fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Some leases also contain options to extend or terminate the lease.
To the extent the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options, they have been considered in the calculation of the right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities.
Under current lease agreements, there are no residual value guarantees or restrictive lease covenants.
In calculating the ROU assets and lease liabilities, several assumptions and judgments were made by the Company, including whether a contract is or contains a lease under the applicable definition, and the determination of the discount rate, which is assumed to be the incremental borrowing rate.
The incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available to the Company at the lease commencement date based on lease length and location.
The components of lease expense recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows: Three months ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Lease Cost Operating lease costs $ 2,430   $ 2,107   Short-term lease costs 529   414   Variable lease costs 41   45   Total lease cost $ 3,000   $ 2,566   - 9 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. Included in the amounts in the table above were rent expense to related parties of $ 314
and $ 291
for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of December 30, 2022, the Company did not have any finance leases or sublease agreements.
Additionally, the Company does not have any leases in which it is the lessor.
While the Company extended or renewed various existing leases during the quarter, there were no significant new leases entered into during the quarter ended December 30, 2022.
As of December 30, 2022, the Company did not have any significant operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced.
Supplemental balance sheet, cash flow, and other information related to operating leases was as follows: Three months ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Operating leases: Operating lease ROU assets $ 55,647   $ 47,443   Current operating lease liabilities 7,510   5,646   Non-current operating lease liabilities 49,519   42,817   Total operating lease liabilities $ 57,029   $ 48,463   Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 12.21 12.15 Weighted average discount rate 3.15   % 3.09   % Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 2,149   $ 1,875   Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial lease term in excess of one year at December 30, 2022 were as follows: Year Related parties included in total Total Remainder of 2023 $ 929   $ 6,822   2024 1,270   8,166   2025 1,308   7,545   2026 1,348   5,878   2027 226   4,710   Thereafter —   36,096   Total undiscounted lease payments 5,081   69,217   Less: Imputed interest ( 155 ) ( 12,188 ) Total net lease liability $ 4,926   $ 57,029   6     INCOME TAXES For the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company’s earnings before income taxes, income tax expense and effective income tax rate were as follows: - 10 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.   Three Months Ended   (thousands, except tax rate data) December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Profit before income taxes $ 8,166   $ 14,589   Income tax expense 2,287   3,733   Effective income tax rate 28.0   % 25.6   %   The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the unfavorable tax expense impact of stock-based compensation awards in the current year period, compared to a tax benefit for similar awards in the prior year period.
The impact of the Company’s operations in jurisdictions where a valuation allowance is assessed is removed from the overall effective tax rate methodology and recorded directly based on year to date results for the year for which no tax expense or benefit can be recognized.
The significant tax jurisdictions that have a valuation allowance for the periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were:   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Indonesia Indonesia Switzerland Switzerland The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes.  As a result, the Company may adjust the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits due to the impact of changes in its assumptions or as a result of new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities and lapses of statutes of limitation.  The Company’s 2023 fiscal year tax expense is anticipated to be unchanged related to uncertain income tax positions. In accordance with its accounting policy, the Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized benefits as a component of income tax expense.
7     INVENTORIES The Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in first-out method) or net realizable value.
Inventories at the end of the respective periods consisted of the following:   December 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Raw materials $ 149,986   $ 166,443   $ 150,064   Work in process 229   230   142   Finished goods 101,310   81,976   67,225     $ 251,525   $ 248,649   $ 217,431   8     GOODWILL The changes in goodwill during the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows:   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Balance at beginning of period $ 11,160   $ 11,221   Amount attributable to movements in foreign currency rates 7   ( 4 ) Balance at end of period $ 11,167   $ 11,217   - 11 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill for a reporting unit on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances warrant such an evaluation.  In conducting this analysis, the Company uses the income approach to compare the reporting unit's carrying value to its indicated fair value.
Fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long-term assumptions and is considered a Level 3 (unobservable) fair value determination in the fair value hierarchy (see Note 13) below. 9     WARRANTIES   The Company provides warranties on certain of its products as they are sold.
The following table summarizes the Company’s warranty activity for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Balance at beginning of period $ 9,639   $ 14,073   Expense accruals for warranties issued during the period 1,852   767   Less current period warranty claims paid 1,793   2,095   Balance at end of period $ 9,698   $ 12,745   10     CONTINGENCIES The Company is subject to various legal actions and proceedings in the normal course of business, including those related to commercial disputes, product liability, intellectual property and regulatory matters. The Company is insured against loss for certain of these matters. Although litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate exposure with respect to these matters cannot be ascertained, management does not believe the final outcome of any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. 11     INDEBTEDNESS The Company had
no
debt outstanding at December 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, or December 31, 2021. Revolvers The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into an unsecured credit facility with PNC Bank National Association and Associated Bank, N.A. ("the Lending Group").  This credit facility consists of a $ 75
million Revolving Credit Facility among the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, PNC Bank National Association, as lender and as administrative agent, and the other lender named therein (as amended, the “Credit Agreement” or “Revolver”).
The Revolver provides for borrowing of up to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $ 75,000
with a $ 50,000
accordion feature that gives the Company the option to increase the maximum financing availability (i.e., an aggregate borrowing amount of $ 125,000 ) subject to the conditions of the Credit Agreement and subject to the approval of the lenders.
On July 15, 2021, the Company entered into a First Amendment to this credit facility that extended its expiration date from November 15, 2022, to July 15, 2026.
Other key provisions of the credit facility remained as outlined herein and the description herein is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the original Debt Agreement (a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the current report on Form 8-K dated and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 20, 2017) and the Amendment, (a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the current report on Form 8-K dated and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 16, 2021).
The interest rate on the Revolver is based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which margin resets each quarter.  The applicable margin ranges from
1.00 % to
1.75 % and is dependent on the Company’s leverage ratio for the trailing twelve month period.  The interest rates on the Revolver at both December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were approximately
5.4 % and
1.1 %, respectively.
The Credit Agreement restricts the Company's ability to incur additional debt, includes maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio covenants and is unsecured. Other Borrowings - 12 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. The Company had
no
unsecured revolving credit facilities at its foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021.  The Company utilizes letters of credit primarily as security for the payment of future claims under its workers’ compensation insurance, which totaled approximately $ 173
and $ 181
as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
12     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The following disclosures describe the Company’s objectives in using derivative instruments, the business purpose or context for using derivative instruments, and how the Company believes the use of derivative instruments helps achieve the stated objectives.  In addition, the following disclosures describe the effects of the Company’s use of derivative instruments and hedging activities on its financial statements.   Foreign Exchange Risk The Company has significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Hong Kong dollars and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company has operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly.  Approximately
12 % of the Company’s revenues for the three month period ended December 30, 2022 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately
5 % were denominated in euros, approximately
5 % were denominated in Canadian dollars and approximately
1 % were denominated in Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining revenues denominated in various other foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can cause the Company to experience unexpected financial losses or cash flow needs. The Company may mitigate a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward contracts.  Foreign currency forward contracts enable the Company to lock in the foreign currency exchange rate to be paid or received for a fixed amount of currency at a specified date in the future. The Company may use such foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on financial instruments and known commitments, including commitments for inventory purchases, denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company held
no
foreign currency forward contracts. 13     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value hierarchy has been established based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. • Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 - Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These are typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments. • Level 3 - Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances. The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated their fair values at December 30, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 due to the short term maturities of these instruments. When indicators of impairment are present, the Company may be required to value certain long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment, and other intangibles at their fair value. Valuation Techniques - 13 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. Rabbi Trust Assets Rabbi trust assets are classified as trading securities and are comprised of marketable debt and equity securities that are marked to fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.  The rabbi trust assets are used to fund amounts the Company owes to certain officers and other employees under the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan.  These assets are included in "Other assets" in the accompanying Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the mark to market adjustments on the assets are recorded in “Other income, net” in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The offsetting deferred compensation liability is also reported at fair value as "Deferred compensation liability" in the Company's accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the liability are recorded in "Administrative management, finance and information systems" expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.   The following table summarizes the Company’s financial assets measured at fair value as of December 30, 2022:     Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets:         Rabbi trust assets $ 22,684   $ —   $ —   $ 22,684     The following table summarizes the Company’s financial assets measured at fair value as of September 30, 2022:     Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets:         Rabbi trust assets $ 21,436   $ —   $ —   $ 21,436     The following table summarizes the Company’s financial assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2021:     Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets:         Rabbi trust assets $ 29,835   $ —   $ —   $ 29,835   The effect of changes in the fair value of financial instruments on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three month periods ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was:    Three Months Ended Location of income recognized in Statement of Operations December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Rabbi trust assets Other income, net $ 1,383   $ 1,095   There were

14     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     Recently issued accounting pronouncements In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848).
ASU 2020-04 is intended to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. Subsequently in December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)—Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,
which delayed the effective date to December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements and disclosures.
- 14 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. 15      REVENUES Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control of our goods at a point in time based on shipping terms and transfer of title.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods.
The amount of consideration received can vary, primarily because of customer incentive or rebate arrangements.
The Company estimates variable consideration based on the expected value of total consideration to which customers are likely to be entitled based on historical experience and projected market expectations.
Included in the estimate is an assessment as to whether any variable consideration is constrained.
Revenue estimates are adjusted at the earlier of a change in the expected value of consideration or when the consideration becomes fixed.
For all contracts with customers, the Company has not adjusted the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be
one year or less .
Sales are made on normal and customary short-term credit terms, generally ranging from 30 to 90 days, or upon delivery of point of sale transactions.
Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The Company enters into contractual arrangements with customers in the form of individual customer orders which specify the goods, quantity, pricing, and associated order terms. The Company does not have contracts which are satisfied over time. Due to the nature of these contracts, no significant judgment exists in relation to the identification of the customer contract, satisfaction of the performance obligation, or transaction price. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract due to the short-term nature of the contracts. Estimated costs of returns, allowances and discounts, based on historic experience, are accrued as a reduction to sales when revenue is recognized.
The Company provides customers the right to return eligible products under certain circumstances.
At December 30, 2022, the right to returns asset was
$ 834
and the accrued returns liability was $ 2,317 . At December 31, 2021, the right to returns asset was $ 780
and the accrued returns liability was $ 2,092 .
The Company also offers assurance-type warranties relating to its products sold to end customers that continue to be accounted for under ASC 460
Guarantees. The Company generally accounts for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment activity, consistent with the timing of revenue recognition; that is, when a customer takes control of the transferred goods. In the event that a customer were to take control of a product upon or after shipment, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat such shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost.
Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in "Net Sales," and shipping and handling costs are recognized within "Marketing and selling expenses" in the same period the related revenue is recognized. The Company has a wide variety of seasonal, outdoor recreation products used primarily for fishing from a boat, diving, paddling, hiking and camping, that are sold to a variety of customers in multiple end markets. Nonetheless, the revenue recognition policies are similar among all the various products sold by the Company.
See Note 16 for required disclosures of disaggregated revenue. 16     SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS The Company conducts its worldwide operations through separate business segments, each of which represents major product lines. Operations are conducted in the United States and various foreign countries, primarily in Europe, Canada and the Pacific Basin.  During the three month period ended December 30, 2022, combined net sales to two customers of the Company's Fishing, Camping and Watercraft Recreation segments represented approximately $ 50,062
of the Company's consolidated revenues.
During the three month period ended December 31, 2021, combined net sales to one customer of the Company's Fishing, Camping and Watercraft Recreation segments represented approximately $ 27,305
of the Company's consolidated revenues.
Net sales and operating profit include both sales to customers, as reported in the Company’s accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and interunit transfers, which are priced to recover cost plus an appropriate profit margin. Total assets represent assets that are used in the Company’s operations in each business segment at the end of the periods presented.   - 15 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.

Overview The Company is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded seasonal outdoor recreation products used primarily for fishing, diving, paddling and camping.  The Company’s portfolio of well-known consumer brands has attained leading market positions due to continuous innovation, marketing excellence, product performance and quality.  The Company’s values and culture support innovation in all areas, promoting and leveraging best practices and synergies within and across its subsidiaries to advance the Company’s strategic vision set by executive management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.  The Company is controlled by Helen P. Johnson-Leipold, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, members of her family and related entities. Coronavirus (COVID-19)  The COVID-19 pandemic drove consumer desire to engage in socially distant and safe activities outdoors. As a result, increased participation in outdoor recreation also increased demand for our products across many of our Company segments.
Beginning in fiscal 2023, however, we are beginning to see a reduction in consumer demand across some of our segments.
- 18 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. COVID-19 and the resulting macroeconomic dynamics have also caused widely-documented supply chain and logistics disruptions across industries, as well as inflationary pressures (especially as it relates to raw material and purchased component prices).
These factors have impacted the timing, sourcing, availability and cost of raw materials and components that are necessary to manufacture our products, all of which adversely impacted our margins and inventory levels during fiscal 2022 and into the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, however, we experienced some improvement in the availability of certain components necessary for manufacturing our products, specifically in the Fishing segment.
Because the Company expects that supply chain and logistics disruptions and inflationary pricing conditions will continue throughout fiscal 2023, the Company remains focused on evaluating and pursuing additional options (beyond building inventory) to meet the demand for its products, including related to evaluating options to improve margins such as implementing customer price increases.
Nonetheless, these factors remain fluid and will likely adversely impact the cost of goods sold for future sales of product. Highlights Net sales of $178,337 for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $24,813, or 16%, from the same period in the prior year.
While sales increased overall, the increased cost of goods sold associated with higher inventory costs resulting from component availability and continued supply chain disruptions, as described above, have resulted in lower gross margins.
Furthermore, higher operating expenses helped drive the $8,288 decrease in operating profit over the prior year quarter.
Seasonality The Company’s business is seasonal in nature. The first fiscal quarter traditionally falls prior to the Company’s primary selling season for its warm-weather outdoor recreation products.  The table below sets forth a historical view of the Company’s seasonality during the last three fiscal years.
Due to the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company's traditional seasonal sales pacing, where our heaviest sales volumes typically occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters, shifted during fiscal 2020.
See “Coronavirus (COVID-19)” above for additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19.     Fiscal Year   2022 2021 2020 Quarter Ended Net Sales Operating Profit Net Sales Operating Profit Net Sales Operating Profit December 21  % 21  % 22  % 22  % 22  % 10  % March 26  % 23  % 27  % 32  % 27  % 45  % June 27  % 36  % 29  % 34  % 23  % 17  % September 26  % 20  % 22  % 12  % 28  % 28  %   100  % 100  % 100  % 100  % 100  % 100  %   Results of Operations The Company’s net sales and operating profit (loss) by business segment for the periods shown below were as follows: - 19 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.   Three Months Ended   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Net sales: Fishing $ 138,041  $ 108,356  Camping 11,613  14,134  Watercraft Recreation 9,658  14,600  Diving 19,059  16,491  Other / Eliminations (34) (57) Total $ 178,337  $ 153,524  Operating profit (loss): Fishing $ 15,572  $ 16,292  Camping 753  2,750  Watercraft Recreation (415) 1,531  Diving 13  453  Other / Eliminations (10,451) (7,266) Total $ 5,472  $ 13,760  See “Note 16 – Segments of Business” of the notes to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the definition of segment net sales and operating profit. Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the three months ended December 30, 2022 were $178,337, an increase of $24,813, or 16%, compared to $153,524 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% on current year first quarter net sales compared to the prior year's first quarter net sales. Net sales for the three months ended December 30, 2022 for the Fishing business were $138,041, an increase of $29,685, or 27%, from $108,356 during the first fiscal quarter of the prior year.
The increase in sales over the prior year quarter is primarily attributable to increased supply and component availability versus the prior year quarter, resulting in our ability to fill more orders with distributors and retail partners, as well as price increases.
Net sales for the Camping business were $11,613 for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, a decrease of $2,521, or 18%, from the prior year net sales during the same period of $14,134 due to decreased sales of Jetboil and Eureka! consumer camping products, as consumer demand declined from the increased levels seen during the pandemic.
Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 for the Watercraft Recreation business were $9,658, a decrease of $4,942, or 34%, compared to $14,600 in the prior year same period.
Reductions in consumer demand from the elevated levels seen during the pandemic drove the decline from the prior year. Net sales for Diving, our most global business, for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $19,059, an increase of $2,568 or 16% versus $16,491 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
As destination travel has rebounded, sales volumes have increased along with the increase in tourism, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on sales in this segment of approximately 6% versus the prior year quarter.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the three months ended December 30, 2022 of $115,558 increased $22,665 compared to $92,893 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The increase year over year was driven in part by increased sales volumes.
Additionally, while the Company began to see some relief in freight and material costs during the quarter, the cost of components, parts and other raw materials in inventory, in some cases at significantly higher price points than what was historically paid, also contributed to the increase over the prior year.
Gross Profit Margin - 20 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. For the three months ended December 30, 2022, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 35.2% compared to 39.5% in the three month period ended December 31, 2021.
While the Company had increased sales volumes and has implemented price increases across product lines, these actions were not enough to offset the higher costs of inventory between quarters, as discussed above. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were $57,307 for the three months ended December 30, 2022, compared to $46,871 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The increase of $10,436 was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume-driven expenses, as well as higher compensation, health insurance and professional services costs between quarters.
Operating Profit Operating profit on a consolidated basis for the three month period ended December 30, 2022 was $5,472, compared to an operating profit of $13,760 in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.   Higher operating expenses and a drop in gross profit, as discussed above, were the primary drivers of the decrease in operating profit between quarters. Interest Interest expense was $37 and $38 for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Interest income was $827 for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $93 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to an increase in interest rates between quarters. Other Expense (Income), net Other income was $1,904 for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $774 in the prior year period.
Net investment gains and earnings on the assets related to the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan were $1,535 in the three month period ended December 30, 2022 compared to $1,334 in the three month period ended December 31, 2021.
For the three months ended December 30, 2022, foreign currency exchange gains were $276 compared to losses of $366 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Income Tax Expense The Company’s provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  The effective tax rate for the three month period ended December 30, 2022 was 28.0%, compared to 25.6% in the corresponding period of the prior year.
Net Income Net income for the three months ended December 30, 2022 was $5,879, or $0.57 per diluted common class A and B share, compared to net income of $10,856, or $1.07 per diluted common class A and B share, for the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Liquidity and Financial Condition Cash and cash equivalents totaled $103,422 as of December 30, 2022, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $167,473 as of December 31, 2021.  The decrease in cash year over year was due primarily to the Company's decision to build and procure numerous categories of inventory (in some cases at significantly higher prices than was historically paid) in an attempt to mitigate against potential shortages since the prior year first quarter.
The Company’s debt to total capitalization ratio was 0% as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.  The Company’s total debt balance was $0 as of each of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.  See “Note 11 – Indebtedness” in the notes to the Company’s accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were $120,553 as of December 30, 2022, an increase of $33,864 compared to $86,689 as of December 31, 2021.  The increase is consistent with increased sales volumes year over year.
Inventories were $251,525 as of December 30, 2022, an increase of $34,094, compared to $217,431 as of December 31, 2021.
As noted above, the increase in our inventory balances over the prior year period is primarily due to increased purchases since then, in many instances at higher costs, in an attempt to build inventory with the goal of mitigating and/or preparing for a continuing disruption of the supply chain. Accounts payable were $57,058 at December 30, 2022 compared to $59,241 as of December 31, 2021. - 21 - Index JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. The Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as presented in the Company’s accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:   Three months ended (thousands) December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash (used for) provided by:     Operating activities $ (17,570) $ (62,773) Investing activities (6,649) (6,244) Financing activities (3,570) (3,466) Effect of foreign currency rate changes on cash 1,408  (492) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (26,381) $ (72,975) Operating Activities Cash used for operations totaled $17,570 for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $62,773 during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The decrease in cash used for operations over the prior year three month period was due primarily to higher inventory purchases in the prior year period, due to the Company's decision to build and procure certain raw material and component inventory in its attempt to mitigate against shortages in meeting product demand.
Depreciation and amortization charges were $3,763 for the three month period ended December 30, 2022 compared to $3,492 for the corresponding period of the prior year.
