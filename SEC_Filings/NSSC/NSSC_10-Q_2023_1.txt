Table of Contents NAPCO SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) December 31, 2022 NOTE 1 - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business : Napco Security Technologies, Inc (“NAPCO”, “the Company”, “we”) is one of the leading manufacturers and designers of high-tech electronic security devices, cellular communication services for intrusion and fire alarm systems as well as a leading provider of school safety solutions. We offer a diversified array of security products, encompassing access control systems, door-locking products, intrusion and fire alarm systems and video surveillance products. These products are used for commercial, residential, institutional, industrial and governmental applications, and are sold worldwide principally to independent distributors, dealers and installers of security equipment. We have experienced significant growth in recent years, primarily driven by fast growing recurring service revenues generated from wireless communication services for intrusion and fire alarm systems, as well as our school security products that are designed to meet the increasing needs to enhance school security as a result of on-campus shooting and violence in the U.S.
The Company's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Historically, the end users of the Company’s hardware products want to install these products prior to the summer; therefore, sales of these products historically peak in the period April 1 through June 30, the Company's fiscal fourth quarter, and are reduced in the period July 1 through September 30, the Company's fiscal first quarter. In addition, demand for all of our products may be affected by the housing and construction markets. Deterioration of the current economic conditions may also affect this trend. The monthly recurring service revenue, which is less susceptable to these fluctuations, allows us to generate a more consistent and predictable stream of income and mitigates the risk of fluctuation in market demand for our equipment products. Significant Accounting Policies : Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Napco Security Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Stock Split In December 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
two -for-one stock split in the form of a
100 % stock dividend of the Company's common stock, payable to stockholders of record on December 20, 2021. The additional shares were distributed on January 4, 2022. All share and per share amounts (except par value) have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. There was no net effect on stockholders’ equity as a result of the stock split. Upon distribution of the dividend, the total number of shares outstanding increased from
18,365,878
to
36,731,756 . Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical estimates include management’s judgments associated with reserves for sales returns and allowances, allowance for credit losses, overhead expenses applied to inventory, inventory reserves, valuation of
intangible assets, share based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the following classes of financial instruments were: Current Assets and Current Liabilities - The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposits, current receivables and payables and
8
Table of Contents certain other short-term financial instruments approximate their fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to their short-term maturities.
Long-term debt and lease liabilities reflect fair value based on prevailing market rates. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments – other Cash and cash equivalents include approximately $ 20,112,000
and $ 63,000
of short-term time deposits, consisting of several certificates of deposit totaling $ 20,049,000
and $ 0 , at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and $ 63,000
in a money market fund as of both December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The Company classifies these highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents. Certificates of Deposit with an original maturity greater than three months are classified as Investments-other.

10,068 ​ The Company has cash balances in banks in excess of the maximum amount insured by the FDIC and other international agencies as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The Company has not historically experienced any credit losses with balances in excess of FDIC limits. Marketable Securities
The Company’s marketable securities include investments in mutual funds, which invest primarily in various government and corporate obligations, stocks and money market funds. The Company’s marketable securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses included in other expense (income). Realized gains or losses on mutual funds are determined on a specific identification basis. The Company would record an impairment charge if the cost of the available-for-sale securities exceeds the estimated fair value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not record an impairment charge regarding its investment in marketable securities because
9
Table of Contents management believes, based on its evaluation of the circumstances, that the decline in fair value below the cost of certain of the Company’s marketable securities is temporary.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable is stated net of the reserves for credit losses of $ 215,000
and $ 243,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Our reserves for credit losses are subjective critical estimates that have a direct impact on reported net earnings. These reserves are based upon the evaluation of our accounts receivable aging, specific exposures, sales levels and historical trends. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The reported net value of inventory includes finished saleable products, work-in-process and raw materials that will be sold or used in future periods. Inventory costs include raw materials, direct labor and overhead. The Company’s overhead expenses are applied based, in part, upon estimates of the proportion of those expenses that are related to procuring and storing raw materials as compared to the manufacture and assembly of finished products. These proportions, the method of their application, and the resulting overhead included in ending inventory, are based in part on subjective estimates and actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, the Company records an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents any excess of the cost of the inventory over its estimated realizable value. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends, product life cycle, requirements to support forecasted sales, and the ability to find alternate applications of its raw materials and to convert finished product into alternate versions of the same product to better match customer demand. In addition, and as necessary, the Company may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. There is inherent professional judgment and subjectivity made by both production and engineering members of management in determining the estimated obsolescence percentage. The Company also regularly reviews the period over which its inventories will be converted to sales. Any inventories expected to convert to sales beyond 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as non-current. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; costs of major renewals and improvements are capitalized. At the time property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts and the profit or loss on such disposition is reflected in income. Depreciation is recorded over the estimated service lives of the related assets using primarily the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or lease term, whichever is shorter. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets in question may not be recoverable. Impairment would be recorded in circumstances
10
Table of Contents where undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than the carrying value of that asset. Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives were not amortized but were tested for impairment at least annually.

4,300 ​ Amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was approximately $ 90,000
and $ 98,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was approximately $ 181,000
and $ 196,000
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is estimated to be as follows: 2023 - $ 361,000 ; 2024 - $ 336,000 ; 2025 - $ 315,000 ; 2026 - $ 297,000 ; and 2027 - $ 283,000 . The weighted average remaining amortization period for intangible assets was
15.8
years and
16.2
years at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. For product sales, the Company typically transfers control at a point in time upon shipment or delivery of the product. For monthly communication services the Company satisfies its performance obligation as the services are rendered and therefore recognizes revenue over the monthly period. Typically timing of revenue recognition coincides with the timing of invoicing to the customers, at which time the Company has an unconditional right to consideration. As such, the Company typically records a receivable when revenue is recognized. The contract with the customer states the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product purchased. Payment for product sales is typically due within
30 and 180
days of the delivery date. Payment for monthly communication services is billed on a monthly basis and is typically due at the beginning of the month of service or in
30 days
for customers with an open account. The Company provides limited standard warranty for defective products, usually for a period of
24 to 36
months. The Company accepts returns for such defective products as well as for other limited circumstances. The Company also provides rebates to customers for meeting specified purchasing targets and other coupons or credits in limited circumstances. The Company establishes reserves for the estimated returns, rebates and credits and measures such variable consideration based on the expected value method using an analysis of historical data. Changes to the estimated variable consideration in subsequent periods are not material. The Company analyzes sales returns and is able to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on the Company’s past history. Estimates for sales returns are based on several factors including actual returns and based on expected return data communicated to it by its customers. Accordingly, the Company believes that its historical returns analysis is an accurate basis for its allowance for sales returns. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Advertising and Promotional Costs Advertising and promotional costs are included in "Selling, General and Administrative" expenses in the consolidated statements of income and are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 505,000
and
11
Table of Contents $ 512,000 , respectively. Advertising expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 1,259,000
and $ 1,598,000 , respectively. Research and Development Costs Research and development (“R&D”) costs incurred by the Company are charged to expense as incurred and are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Company-sponsored R&D expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 2,222,000
and $ 1,978,000 , respectively. Company-sponsored R&D expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 4,650,000
and $ 3,909,000 , respectively. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company measures and recognizes the tax implications of positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns on an ongoing basis. The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Net Income per Share Basic net income per common share (Basic EPS) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per common share (Diluted EPS) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents and convertible securities then outstanding. The following provides a reconciliation of information used in calculating the per share amounts for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except share and per share data): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Income ​ Weighted Average Shares ​ Net Income per Share ​      2022      2021      2022 ​ 2021 ​ 2022      2021 Basic EPS ​ $

These options were still outstanding at the end of the period. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has established
four
share incentive programs as discussed in Note 9. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates, among other factors. Stock-based compensation costs of $ 335,000
and $ 1,255,000
were recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock-based compensation costs of $ 812,000
and $ 1,344,000
were recognized for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Foreign Currency The Company has determined the functional currency of all foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign operations are considered a direct and integral part or extension of the Company’s operations. The day-to-day operations of all foreign subsidiaries are dependent on the economic environment of the U.S. Dollar. Therefore,
no
realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with foreign currency translation are recorded for the three or six months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. Comprehensive Income For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s operations did not give rise to material items includable in comprehensive income, which were not already included in net income. Accordingly, the Company’s comprehensive income approximates its net income for all periods presented. Segment Reporting The Company’s reportable operating segments are determined based on the Company’s management approach. The management approach is based on the way that the chief operating decision maker organizes the segments within an enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company’s results of operations are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis and the Company operates in only
one
segment. The Company has presented required geographical data in Note 13. Shipping and Handling Sales and Costs The Company records the amount billed to customers for shipping and handling in net sales ($ 128,000
and $ 106,000
in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 240,000
and $ 212,000
in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively); and classifies the costs associated with these sales in cost of sales ($ 454,000
and $ 361,000
in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 848,000
and $ 694,000
in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively). 13
Table of Contents Leases The Company records lease assets and corresponding lease liabilities for the operating lease on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, excluding short-term leases (leases with terms of 12 months or less) as described under ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) . Lease payments are discounted using a third-party secured incremental borring rate based on information available at lease commencement. The Company analyzes whether or not amendments to existing leases classify as a Lease Modification or a full or partial termination of the existing lease. See Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies; Leases for additional accounting policies and disclosures. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Reference Rate Reform (ASC Topic 848) In March 2020, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to provide optional relief for companies preparing for the discontinuation of interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), which is expected to be phased out for new arrangements at the end of calendar 2021, and applies to lease contracts, hedging instruments, held-to-maturity debt securities and debt arrangements that have LIBOR as the benchmark rate. In January 2021, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that makes amendments to the new rules on accounting for reference rate reform. The amendments clarify that for all derivative instruments affected by the changes to interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment, regardless of whether they reference LIBOR or another rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform, an entity may apply certain practical expedients in ASC Topic 848. Effective for the Company – This guidance can be applied for a limited time through December 31, 2022. The guidance will no longer be available to apply after December 31, 2022. Impact on consolidated financial statements – The Company’s bank has notified the Company that its LIBOR option will continue to be available to it through June 30, 2023, at which time the option will shift to the Benchmark Replacement as defined in the agreement with the bank (see Note 8). The Company does not believe that this transition will have a material impact on its financial condition. 14
Table of Contents NOTE 2 – Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers The Company is engaged in
one
major line of business: the development, manufacture, and distribution of security products, encompassing access control systems, door security products, intrusion and fire alarm systems, alarm communication services, and video surveillance products for commercial and residential use. The Company also provides wireless communication service for intrusion and fire alarm systems on a monthly basis. All of these products and services are used for commercial, residential, institutional, industrial and governmental applications, and are sold primarily to independent distributors, dealers and installers of security equipment. Sales to unaffiliated customers are primarily shipped from the United States. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company included refund liabilities of approximately $ 4,096,000
and $ 5,863,000 , respectively, in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company included return-related assets of approximately $ 909,000
and $ 974,000 , respectively, in other current assets. As a percentage of gross sales, returns, rebates and allowances were
5 % and
13 % for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a percentage of gross sales, returns, rebates and allowances were
5 % and
11 % for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into major product lines. The Company determines that disaggregating revenue into these categories achieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. As noted in the accounting policy footnote, the Company’s business consists of
one
operating segment.

Such risks of loss manifest themselves differently, depending on the nature of the concentration, and vary in significance. The Company had one customer with an accounts receivable balance that comprised of
13 % and
16 % as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. Sales to this customer did not exceed 10% of net sales during the three or six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company had another customer with an accounts receivable balance of
14 % and
22 %  as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. Sales to this customer was
10 % for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021 did not exceed 10% of net sales. The Company had another customer with an accounts receivable balance that comprised of
11 % as of December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, the accounts receivable balance with this respective customer did not exceed 10%. Sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 did not exceed 10% either.

4 The fair values of the Company’s marketable securities are determined as being the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the Company utilizes the three-tier value hierarchy, as prescribed by US GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
• Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
• Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
• Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
​ The Company’s marketable securities, which are considered available-for-sale securities, are re-measured to fair value on a recurring basis and are valued using Level 1 inputs using quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets.
The following tables summarize the Company’s investments at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2022 ​ June 30, 2022 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unrealized ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unrealized ​ Cost      Fair Value      Gain (Loss)      Cost      Fair Value      Gain (Loss) Mutual Funds - Level 1 $

for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. ​ NOTE 7 - Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, and state and local income taxes. The effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), tax benefit of R&D credits, and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, and state and local income taxes. In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition de-recognition or re-measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period is recognized separately in the quarter of the change. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31,2021, the Company recognized net income tax expense of $ 1,921,000
and $ 639,000 , respectively. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s reserve for uncertain income tax positions increased by $ 24,000 .  The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense and accrued income taxes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued interest totaling $ 112,000 , as well as $ 678,000  of unrecognized net tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective income tax rate in any future period. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, additional interest expense was accrued for in the amount of $ 24,000 .
The Company does not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next twelve months due to statute of limitation lapses. We file a consolidated U.S. income tax return and tax returns in certain state and local and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, we remain subject to examination in all tax jurisdictions for all relevant jurisdictional statutes for fiscal years 2018 and thereafter. In December 2022, the Company received a letter from the IRS (“IRS”) notifying it that the IRS has closed it's examination of the Company’s income tax return for fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.  There has been no changes proposed in relation to this examination.   17
Table of Contents NOTE 8 - Long-Term Debt As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had a revolving line of credit of $ 11,000,000
(“Revolver Agreement”) which expires in June 2024. Outstanding balances and interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are as follows (dollars in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2022 ​ June 30, 2022   ​      Outstanding      Interest Rate ​ Outstanding      Interest Rate   Revolving line of credit: ​      ​ ​ ​      ​ ​ ​ Current maturities ​ $

— ​ ​ ​ ​ The Revolver Agreement also provides for a LIBOR-based interest rate option of LIBOR plus
1.15 % to
2.00 %, depending on the ratio of outstanding debt to EBITDA, which is to be measured and adjusted quarterly, a prime rate-based option of the prime rate plus
0.25 % and other terms and conditions as more fully described in the Revolver Agreement. The Company’s obligations under the Revolver Agreement continue to be secured by substantially all of its domestic assets, including but not limited to, deposit accounts, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and fixtures and intangible assets. In addition, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, with the exception of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, have issued guarantees and pledges of all of their assets to secure the Company’s obligations under the Revolver Agreement. All of the outstanding common stock of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries and
65%
of the common stock of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries has been pledged to secure the Company’s obligations under the Revolver Agreement. The Revolver Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants including, among others, restrictions on payment of dividends, restrictions on borrowings and compliance with certain financial ratios, as defined in the Revolver Agreement. In September 2020, the Company and its lender amended the Revolver Agreement, which had an expiration date of June 2021, to expire in June 2024. The amended Revolver Agreement also removed certain requirements and restrictions on the Company as well as removing the mortgage on the Company’s Amityville facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company received the proceeds of promissory notes dated between April 17, 2020 and May 7, 2020 (the "PPP Loan Agreement"), entered into between the Company and HSBC Bank USA N.A., as lender (the "Lender). Lender made the loans pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the "PPP"), created by Section 1102 of the CARES Act and governed by the CARES Act, Section 7(a)(36) of the Small Business Act, any rules or guidance that has been issued by the Small Business Association (“SBA”) implementing the PPP and acting as guarantor, or any other applicable loan program requirements, as defined in 13 CFR § 120.10, as amended from time to time. Pursuant to the PPP Loan Agreement, the Lender made loans to the Company with an aggregate principal amount of $ 3,904,000
(the "PPP Loan"). The PPP Loan and related extinguishement was accounted for in accordance with ASC 470 “Debt”. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the loans may be forgiven by the SBA. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the PPP Loans were forgiven, in their entirety, in accordance with guidelines set forth in the PPP loan documents. The Company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt during the quarter ended September 30, 2021 in the amount of $ 3,904,000
within the other (expense) income section in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. The SBA reserves the right to audit PPP forgiveness applications for a period of six years from the date of forgiveness. It has indicated that it will audit all of those that are in excess of $2 million. ​ NOTE 9 - Stock Option The Company follows ASC 718 (“Share-Based Payment”), which requires that all share-based payments to employees, including stock options, be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values and over the requisite service period. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded non-cash compensation expense of $ 335,000
($ 0.01
per basic and diluted share) and $ 1,255,000
($ 0.03
per basic and diluted share), respectively, relating to stock-based compensation. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded non-cash compensation expense of

The 2022 Employee Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Company’s annual shareholder’s meeting in December 2022. The plan authorizes the granting of awards, the exercise of which would allow up to an aggregate of
950,000
shares of the Company’s common stock to be acquired by the holders of such awards. The terms of the 2022 Plan are substantially the same as those of the 2012 Employee Stock Option Plan.

in annual service charges. On September 14, 2022, a lease modification was executed which provides for an annual base rent of $ 235,000
plus $ 105,000
in annual service charges. The service charges increase
2 % annually over the remaining life of the lease. The modification resulted in a remeasurement of the operating lease asset and liability and the effect was a reduction to the asset and liability of $ 1.3
million. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, accrued expenses and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three months December 31, 2022 and 2021 cash payments against operating lease liabilities totaled $ 92,000

Overview Napco Security Technologies, Inc (“NAPCO”, “the Company”, “we”) is one of the leading manufacturers and designers of high-tech electronic security devices, cellular communication services for intrusion and fire alarm systems as well as a leading provider of school safety solutions. We offer a diversified array of security products, encompassing access control systems, door-locking products, intrusion and fire alarm systems and video surveillance products. These products are used for commercial, residential, institutional, industrial and governmental applications, and are sold worldwide principally to independent distributors, dealers and installers of security equipment. We have experienced significant growth in recent years, primarily driven by fast growing recurring service revenues generated from wireless communication services for intrusion and fire alarm systems, as well as our school security products that are designed to meet the increasing needs to enhance school security as a result of on-campus shooting and violence in the U.S.
Since 1969, NAPCO has established a heritage and proven record in the professional security community for reliably delivering both advanced technology and high-quality security solutions, building many of the industry’s widely recognized brands, such as NAPCO Security Systems, Alarm Lock, Continental Access, Marks USA, and other popular product lines: including Gemini and F64-Series hardwire/wireless intrusion systems and iSee Video internet video solutions. We are also dedicated to developing innovative technology and producing the next generation of reliable security solutions that utilize remote communications and wireless networks, including our StarLink, iBridge, and more recently the iSecure product lines. Today, millions of businesses, institutions, homes, and people around the globe are protected by products from the NAPCO Group of Companies. Economic and Other Factors We are subject to the effects of general economic and market conditions. If the U.S. or international economic conditions deteriorate, our revenue, profit and cash-flow levels could be materially adversely affected in future periods. In the event of such deterioration, many of our current or potential future customers may experience serious cash flow problems and as a result may, modify, delay or cancel purchases of our products. Additionally, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us. If such events do occur, they may result in our fixed and semi-variable expenses becoming too high in relation to our revenues and cash flows. 27
Table of Contents Seasonality The Company's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Historically, the end users of the Company’s hardware products want to install these products prior to the summer; therefore, sales of these products historically peak in the period April 1 through June 30, the Company's fiscal fourth quarter, and are reduced in the period July 1 through September 30, the Company's fiscal first quarter. The monthly recurring service revenue, which is less susceptable to these fluctuations, allows us to generate a more consistent and predictable stream of income and mitigates the risk of fluctuation in market demand for our equipment products. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company’s significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in its 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes these critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

The increase in sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to increased recurring communication service revenues ($3,852,000), Alarm Lock brand door-locking products ($3,191,000), Marks brand door-locking products ($1,288,000), and Continental brand access control products ($664,000) partialy offset by Napco brand intrusion products, which include the Company’s cellular radio products which declined ($89,000). Net Sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $17,348,000, or 26.9%, to $81,807,000 as compared to $64,459,000 for the same period a year ago. The increase in sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to increased recurring communication service revenues ($7,434,000), Napco brand intrusion products, which include the Company’s cellular radio products ($3,242,000), Alarm Lock brand door-locking products ($4,317,000), Marks brand door-locking products ($1,285,000), and Continental brand access control products ($1,069,000). The Company’s increase in equipment sales was primarily due to customer demand returning after the decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and the related closures throughout the United States.

Table of Contents The Company's gross profit increased by $8,019,000 to $19,462,000, or 46.0% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $11,443,000, or 34.3% of net sales, for the same period a year ago. Gross profit on equipment sales was $6,247,000, or 22.8% of net equipment sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $1,809,000, or 8.1% of net equipment sales, for the same period a year ago. Gross profit on service revenues was $13,215,000, or 88.8% of net service revenues, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $9,634,000, or 87.4% of net service revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in gross profit in dollars and as a percentage of net sales on equipment sales and service revenues was was primarily the result of the increase in revenues of each as described above as well as increased availability and lower costs of components and transportation as compared to the same period last year which resulted from improvements within the Company’s supply chain. The increase in revenues resulted in improved overhead absorption rates. In addition, the increase in gross margin on service revenues was due, in part, to increased service revenues relating to the Company’s fire radios, which have higher monthly selling prices than the Company’s intrusion radios.
The Company's gross profit increased by $12,730,000 to $37,629,000, or 46.0% of net sales, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $24,899,000, or 38.6% of net sales, for the same period a year ago. Gross profit on equipment sales was $12,269,000, or 23.1% of net equipment sales, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and $6,464,000, or 15.0% of net equipment sales, for the same period a year ago. Gross profit on service revenues was $25,360,000, or 88.4% of net service revenues, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and $18,435,000, or 86.7% of net service revenues, for the same period a year ago.

Research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $244,000 to $2,222,000, or 5.3% of net sales, as compared to $1,978,000, or 5.9% of net sales, for the same period a year ago. Research and development expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $741,000 to $4,650,000, or 5.7% of net sales, as compared to $3,909,000, or 6.1% of net sales, for the same period a year ago.
The increase in dollars was due primarily to
salary increases and additional staff. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $391,000 or 4.8% to $7,804,000 from $8,195,000 for the same period a year ago. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 18.4% for the three months ended December 31 2022 as compared to 24.5% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in dollars resulted primarily from higher stock option expense and legal expenses incurred in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to the increase in net sales as partially offset by the aforementioned increase in expense dollars. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by 753,000 or 4.8% to $16,294,000 from $15,541,000 for the same period a year ago. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 19.9% for the six months ended December 31 2022 as compared to 24.1% for the same period a year ago. The increase in dollars resulted primarily from increases in credit card processing fees, insurance expense and commission expenses. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to the increase in net sales as partially offset by the aforementioned increase in expense dollars. Interest and other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $129,000 to income of $187,000 as compared to income of $58,000 for the same period a year ago. Interest and other income (expense), net for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $9,000 to income of $84,000 as compared to income of $75,000 for the same period a year ago. Gain on extinguishment of debt resulted from a one-time gain in the three months ended September 30, 2021 which resulted from the forgiveness of the Company’s PPP loans as described in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 29
Table of Contents The Company’s provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $886,000 to $1,177,000 as compared to $291,000 for the same period a year ago. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the three months was primarily due to higher taxable income in the U.S. The Company’s effective rate for income tax was 12.2% and 21.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company’s provision for income taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $1,282,000 to $1,921,000 as compared to $639,000 for the same period a year ago. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the six months was primarily due to higher taxable income in the U.S. The Company’s effective rate for income tax was 11.5% and 6.8% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was reduced due to the other income of $3.9 million being non-taxable. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $7,409,000 to $8,446,000 or $0.23 per diluted share as compared to $1,037,000 or $0.03 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $6,059,000 to $14,848,000 or $0.40 per diluted share as compared to $8,789,000 or $0.24 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. The increase in net income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the items described above. Without the inclusion of $3.9 million of income from the forgiveness of debt net income and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2021 would have been $4.9 million and $0.13, respectively Liquidity and Capital Resources During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company utilized a portion of its cash balance at June 30, 2022 ($10,856,000 of $41,730,000) to purchase marketable securities and other investments ($10,078,000) and property, plant and equipment ($816,000). During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated a cash flow from operations of $1,088,000. The Company believes its current working capital, cash flows from operations and its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations through the next twelve months.
Accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 decreased by $8,233,000 to $20,985,000 as compared to $29,218,000 at June 30, 2022. This decrease is primarily the result of the higher sales volume of equipment during the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which is typically the Company’s highest, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2022. In addition, sales of the Company’s radio communication products were unusually high in the month of June 2022 due to the Company fulfilling backorders of these products which had built up during the world-wide supply chain difficulties. Sales of these products were at more normal levels in the month of December 2022. Inventories, which include both current and non-current portions, increased by $14,406,000 to $64,192,000 at December 31, 2022 as compared to $49,786,000 at June 30, 2022. The increase was due primarily to a build-up of inventory of the Company’s radio products in order to mitigate potential supply chain interuptions of these products. The increase was also due to the ongoing shortages of certain component parts and the Company purchasing large quantities of these hard to source component parts when they become available. As these challenges begin to subside, the Company believes it’s inventory levels will decrease. Accounts payable and accrued expenses, not including income taxes payable, decreased by $6,917,000 to $17,708,000 as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $24,625,000 as of June 30, 2022. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the Company’s accrued refund liability, which is explained in Note 2 to the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, and a decrease in accrued salaries, a decrease in accrued annual bonuses and a decrease in accounts payable which relates to the Company reducing purchases of component parts in the latter part of the quarter ended December 31, 2022 after building up it’s inventory in fiscal 2022.
As of December 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term debt consisted of a revolving line of credit of $11,000,000 (“Revolver Agreement”), with no amounts outstanding, which expires in June 2024. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants including, among others, restrictions on borrowings and compliance with certain financial ratios, as defined in the agreement. The Company’s long-term debt is described more fully in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases other than purchase orders issued in the normal course of business. In addition, the Company has a refund liability of $4,096,000 as of December 31, 2022 for customer returns and promotional credits as more fully discussed in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. ​ 30
Table of Contents ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company's principal financial instrument is long-term debt (consisting of a revolving credit facility) that provides for interest based on the prime rate or LIBOR as described in the agreement. The Company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the Company under these credit facilities. All foreign sales transactions by the Company are denominated in U.S. dollars. As such, the Company has shifted foreign currency exposure onto its foreign customers. As a result, if exchange rates move against foreign customers, the Company could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable, the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders. The foregoing could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk relative to expenses incurred in Dominican Pesos ("RD$"), the local currency of the Company's production facility in the Dominican Republic. The result of a 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar to the RD$ would result in an annual increase or decrease in income from operations of approximately $944,000. ​ ITEM 4: Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management’s control objectives. At the conclusion of the period ended December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, management identified two material weaknesses in internal control.
One material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the area of user access and lack of effective program change-management over certain information technology (IT) systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. Our business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. We believe that these control deficiencies were a result of: IT control processes lacking sufficient documentation and risk-assessment procedures to assess changes in the IT environment and program change management of personnel that could impact internal controls over financial reporting. The material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements and there were no changes to the previously released financial results. Based on this material weaknesses, the Company’s management concluded that at June 30, 2022 the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective.
The second material weakness in internal control related to the reserve for excess and slow-moving inventory. This control deficiency was a result of a lack of effective review and reconciliation controls over the forecasted sales and usage data. The material weakness did not result in a material misstatement to the financial statements. There were no changes to the previously released financial results. Management is currently designing and implementing additional controls and procedures to remediate these items and expects to complete these actions during fiscal 2023. These include, but are not limited to, modifying its program change-management process over certain of its information technology (IT) systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes as well as implementing changes to its forecasted sales and usage data used in calculating its reserve for excess and slow-moving inventory. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s controls over financial reporting were not effective because of the two material weaknesses noted above.
