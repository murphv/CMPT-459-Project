Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited, dollars in thousands, except for share and per share data) 1. Nature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation
Description of Business     The Simply Good Foods Company (“Simply Good Foods” or the “Company”) is a consumer packaged food and beverage company that aims to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements, and other product offerings. The product portfolio the Company develops, markets and sells consists primarily of protein bars, ready-to-drink (“RTD”) shakes, sweet and salty snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Atkins®, Atkins Endulge®, Quest® and Quest Hero TM
brand names. Simply Good Foods is poised to expand its wellness platform through innovation and organic growth along with acquisition opportunities in the nutritional snacking space.     The Company’s nutritious snacking platform consists of brands that specialize in providing products for consumers that follow certain nutritional philosophies and health-and-wellness trends: Atkins® for those following a low-carb lifestyle and Quest® for consumers seeking a variety of protein-rich foods and beverages that also limit sugars and simple carbs. The Company distributes its products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club, and mass merchandise, as well as through e-commerce, convenience, specialty, and other channels. The Company’s portfolio of nutritious snacking brands gives it a strong platform with which to introduce new products, expand distribution, and attract new consumers to its products.     The common stock of Simply Good Foods is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SMPL.” Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Simply Good Foods and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Simply Good Foods and its subsidiaries.     The Company maintains its accounting records on a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending on the last Saturday in August of each year.
The interim consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company and its subsidiaries are unaudited. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and disclosures which are, in the Company’s opinion, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the indicated periods. All such adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements and, in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q, certain information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The results reported in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire fiscal year and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) filed with the SEC on October 21, 2022.     The ultimate effect the supply chain challenges, cost pressures, current high inflation environment, and the possible economic recession could have on consumer purchasing patterns and on the Company’s business continues to be not fully known. Additionally, management is continuing to monitor the conflict in Ukraine, especially regarding the availability and cost of raw materials that are produced in this region and Europe in general. Management is also monitoring the situation in Eastern Europe for its possible supply chain and consumer consumption effects on the Company’s business. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies      Refer to Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report for a description of significant accounting policies. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted     In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional
8 Table of Contents
guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities and can be applied to contract modifications due to rate reform and eligible existing and new hedging relationships entered into between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2022. The amendments of this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis.     On January 21, 2022, the Company entered into a repricing amendment (the “2022 Repricing Amendment”) to its credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and other parties (as amended to date, the “Credit Agreement”), as described in Note 5, Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit. In addition to replacing the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the Credit Agreement’s reference rate with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), the 2022 Repricing Amendment contemporaneously modified other terms that changed, or had the potential to change, the amount or timing of contractual cash flows as contemplated by the guidance in ASU 2020-04. As such, the contract modifications related to the 2022 Repricing Amendment were outside of the scope of the optional guidance in ASU 2020-04. The Company will continue to monitor the effects of rate reform, if any, on any new or amended contracts through December 31, 2022. The Company does not anticipate the amendments in this ASU will be material to its consolidated financial statements.     No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 3.

Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit
On July 7, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and other parties (as amended to date, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement at that time provided for (i) a term facility of $ 200.0
million (“Term Facility”) with a
seven -year maturity and (ii) a revolving credit facility of up to $ 75.0
million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a
five -year maturity. Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the business combination which formed the Company between Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. and NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. on July 7, 2017, the full $ 200.0
million of the Term Facility (the “Term Loan”) was drawn.
10 Table of Contents
On November 7, 2019, the Company entered into a second amendment (the “Incremental Facility Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to increase the principal borrowed on the Term Facility by $ 460.0
million. The Term Facility together with the incremental borrowing make up the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the Incremental Facility Amendment). The Incremental Facility Amendment was executed to partially finance the acquisition of Quest Nutrition, LLC on November 7, 2019. No amounts under the Term Facility were repaid as a result of the execution of the Incremental Facility Amendment.     Effective as of December 16, 2021, the Company entered into a third amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Extension Amendment provided for an extension of the stated maturity date of the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) from July 7, 2022 to the earlier of (i) 91 days prior to the then-effective maturity date of the Initial Term Loans and (ii) December 16, 2026.
On January 21, 2022, the Company entered into the “2022 Repricing Amendment” to the Credit Agreement. The 2022 Repricing Amendment, among other things, (i) reduced the interest rate per annum applicable to the Initial Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of the 2022 Repricing Amendment, (ii) reset the prepayment premium for the existing Initial Term Loans to apply to Repricing Transactions (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that occur within six months after the effective date of the 2022 Repricing Amendment, and (iii) implemented SOFR and related replacement provisions for LIBOR.     Effective as of the 2022 Repricing Amendment dated January 21, 2022, the interest rate per annum is based on either: i. A base rate equaling the higher of (a) the “prime rate,” (b) the federal funds effective rate plus
0.50 %, or (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) applicable for an interest period of one month plus
1.00 % plus (x)
2.25 % margin for the Term Loan or (y)
2.00 % margin for the Revolving Credit Facility; or
ii. SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment equal to
0.10 % for one-month SOFR,
0.15 % for up to three-month SOFR and
0.25 % for up to six-month SOFR, subject to a floor of
0.50 %, plus (x)
3.25 % margin for the Term Loan or (y)
3.00 % margin for the Revolving Credit Facility.     The Simply Good Foods Company is not a borrower under the Credit Agreement and has not provided a guarantee of the Credit Agreement. Simply Good Foods USA, Inc., is the administrative borrower and certain other subsidiary holding companies are co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement. Each of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries that is not a named borrower under the Credit Agreement has provided a guarantee on a secured basis. As security for the payment or performance of the debt under the Credit Agreement, the borrowers and the guarantors have pledged certain equity interests in their respective subsidiaries and granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of their domestic assets. All guarantors other than Quest Nutrition, LLC are holding companies with no assets other than their investments in their respective subsidiaries.     The Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders, and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than
6.00 :1.00 contingent on credit extensions in excess of
30 % of the total amount of commitments available under the Revolving Credit Facility. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may result in an event of default. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of November 26, 2022 and August 27, 2022, respectively.      Long-term debt consists of the following: (In thousands) November 26, 2022 August 27, 2022 Term Facility (effective rate of 7.7% at November 26, 2022) $ 400,000   $ 406,500   Finance lease liabilities (effective rate of 5.6% at November 26, 2022) 333   406   Less: Deferred financing fees 3,089   3,620   Total debt 397,244 403,286 Less: Current finance lease liabilities 250 264 Long-term debt, net of deferred financing fees $ 396,994 $ 403,022     The Company is
no t required to make principal payments on the Term Facility over the twelve months following the period ended November 26, 2022. The outstanding balance of the Term Facility is due upon its maturity in July 2024.     As of November 26, 2022, the Company had letters of credit in the amount of $ 3.5
million outstanding. These letters of credit offset against the $ 75.0

The Company utilizes market approaches to estimate the fair value of certain outstanding borrowings by discounting anticipated future cash flows derived from the contractual terms of the obligations and observable market interest and foreign exchange rates. The Company carries debt at historical cost and discloses fair value. As of November 26, 2022 and August 27, 2022, the book value of the Company’s debt approximated fair value. The estimated fair value of the Term Loan is valued based on observable inputs and classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measurements, a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies, is used: Level 1 – Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2 – Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 – Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. Level 3 Measurements     During the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, the Company had outstanding liability-classified Private Warrants that allowed holders to purchase
6,700,000
shares of the Company’s common stock. Such Private Warrants were held by Conyers Park Sponsor, LLC (“Conyers Park”), a related party, and were exercised on a cashless basis on January 7, 2022 resulting in a net issuance of
4,830,761
shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, there were
no
outstanding liability-classified Private Warrants as of November 26, 2022 and August 27, 2022. Refer to Note 10, Stockholders’ Equity, for additional details regarding the cashless exercise of the Private Warrants.     The Company utilized the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of the Private Warrants at each reporting date. The application of the Black-Scholes model utilizes significant assumptions, including volatility. Significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility, historically the key assumption, of the Private Warrants. In order to determine the most accurate measure of this volatility, the Company measured expected volatility based on several inputs, including considering a peer group of publicly traded companies, the Company’s implied volatility based on traded options, the implied volatility of comparable warrants, and the implied volatility of any outstanding public warrants during the periods they were outstanding. As a result of the unobservable inputs that were used to determine the expected volatility of the Private Warrants, the fair value measurement of these warrants reflected a Level 3 measurement within the fair value measurement hierarchy.     The periodic remeasurement of the warrant liability has been reflected in

million. 7. Income Taxes      The tax expense and the effective tax rate resulting from operations were as follows: Thirteen Weeks Ended (In thousands) November 26, 2022 November 27, 2021 Income before income taxes $ 45,556   $ 33,975   Income tax expense $ 9,696   $ 12,823   Effective tax rate 21.3   % 37.7   %     The effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 was
16.4 % less than the effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, which was primarily driven by the non-cash change in the fair value of the warrant liability in the prior fiscal period and other permanent differences. 12 Table of Contents

From time to time, the Company has been and may again become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not presently a party to any litigation that it believes to be material, and the Company is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against it that its management believes could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Other     The Company has entered into endorsement contracts with certain celebrity figures and social media influencers to promote and endorse the Atkins and Quest brands and product lines. These contracts contain endorsement fees, which are expensed ratably over the life of the contract, and performance fees, that are recognized at the time of achievement. Based on the terms of the contracts in place and achievement of performance conditions as of November 26, 2022, the Company will be required to make payments of $ 3.4
million over the next year. 10. Stockholders’ Equity Stock Repurchase Program     The Company adopted a $ 50.0
million stock repurchase program on November 13, 2018. On April 13, 2022, and October 21, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved the addition of $ 50.0
million and $ 50.0
million, respectively, to its stock repurchase program, resulting in authorized stock repurchases of up to an aggregate of $ 150.0
million. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specific period of time. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time by the Company and does not have an expiration date.     During the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022, the Company repurchased
546,346
shares of common stock at an average share price of $ 30.11
per share. The Company did
not
repurchase any shares of common stock during the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. As of November 26, 2022, approximately $ 71.5
million remained available under the stock repurchase program. 14 Table of Contents
Warrants to Purchase Common Stock     During the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, the Company had outstanding liability-classified Private Warrants that allowed holders to purchase
6,700,000
shares of the Company’s common stock. Such Private Warrants were held by Conyers Park, a related party. Each whole warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of the Company’s common stock at a price of $ 11.50
per share. On January 7, 2022, Conyers Park elected to exercise the Private Warrants on a cashless basis, resulting in a net issuance of
4,830,761
shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result of the cashless exercise on January 7, 2022, there were
no
outstanding liability-classified Private Warrants as of as of November 26, 2022 and August 27, 2022.     As discussed in Note 6, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, the liability-classified warrants were remeasured on a recurring basis, primarily based on observable market data while the related theoretical private warrant volatility assumption within the Black-Scholes model represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The periodic fair value remeasurements of the warrant liability have been reflected in
Loss in fair value change of warrant liability
within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 11. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings or loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding. In computing diluted earnings per share, basic earnings per share is adjusted for the assumed issuance of all potentially dilutive securities, including the Company’s employee stock options, non-vested stock units, and Private Warrants for the periods during which they were outstanding. During periods when the effect of the outstanding Private Warrants was dilutive, the Company assumed share settlement of the instruments as of the beginning of the reporting period and adjusted the numerator to remove the change in fair value of the warrant liability and adjusted the denominator to include the dilutive shares, calculated using the treasury stock method. During periods when the effect of the outstanding Private Warrants was anti-dilutive, the share settlement was excluded.     In periods in which the Company has a net loss, diluted loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding as the effect of including common stock equivalents outstanding would be anti-dilutive.      The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used in the computations of both basic and diluted earnings per share:   Thirteen Weeks Ended (In thousands, except per share data) November 26, 2022 November 27, 2021 Basic earnings per share computation: Numerator: Net income available to common stockholders $ 35,860   $ 21,152   Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 99,200,557   95,856,845   Basic earnings per share from net income $ 0.36   $ 0.22   Diluted earnings per share computation: Numerator: Net income available for common stockholders $ 35,860   $ 21,152   Numerator for diluted earnings per share $ 35,860   $ 21,152   Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 99,200,557   95,856,845   Employee stock options 1,299,543   1,652,577   Non-vested stock units 222,936   352,151   Weighted average common shares - diluted 100,723,036   97,861,573   Diluted earnings per share from net income $ 0.36   $ 0.22       Diluted earnings per share calculations for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021 excluded

0.1  million non-vested stock units and an immaterial number of non-vested stock units, respectively, that would have been anti-dilutive.
Diluted earnings per share calculations for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021 excluded
4.6
million shares issuable upon exercise of Private Warrants that would have been anti-dilutive. 12. Omnibus Incentive Plan      Stock-based compensation includes stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock unit awards and stock appreciation rights, which are awarded to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. Stock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on their grant date fair value. Stock-based compensation expense is included within
General and administrative
expense, which is the same financial statement caption where the recipient’s other compensation is reported.     The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $ 3.3  million and $ 2.6  million in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively. Stock Options      The following table summarizes stock option activity for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022: Shares underlying options Weighted average exercise price Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) Outstanding as of August 27, 2022 2,776,551   $ 18.04   6.10 Granted 135,001   38.61   Exercised ( 314,431 ) 14.51   Forfeited —   —   Outstanding as of November 26, 2022 2,597,121   $ 19.54   6.09 Vested and expected to vest as of November 26, 2022 2,597,121   $ 19.54   6.09 Exercisable as of November 26, 2022 2,064,196   $ 15.62   5.42     As of November 26, 2022, the Company had $ 6.0

years. Performance Stock Units     During the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022, the Board of Directors granted performance stock units under the Company’s equity compensation plan. Performance stock units vest in a range between
0 % and
200 % based upon certain performance criteria in a
three -year period. Performance stock units were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. 16 Table of Contents
The following table summarizes performance stock unit activity for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022: Units Weighted average grant-date fair value Non-vested as of August 27, 2022 255,023   $ 32.82   Granted 50,629   62.55   Vested ( 72,452 ) 27.39   Forfeited ( 20,338 ) 27.39   Non-vested as of November 26, 2022 212,862   $ 42.25       As of November 26, 2022, the Company had $ 6.0
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance stock units that will be recognized over a weighted average period of  1.7
years. Stock Appreciation Rights     Stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) permit the holder to participate in the appreciation of the Company’s common stock price and are awarded to non-employee consultants of the Company. The Company’s SARs settle in shares of its common stock once the applicable vesting criteria have been met. The SARs outstanding as of November 26, 2022 cliff vest
two years
from the date of grant and must be exercised within
five years .      The following table summarizes SARs activity for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022: Shares underlying SARs Weighted average exercise price Outstanding as of August 27, 2022 150,000   $ 24.20   Granted 150,000   37.67   Exercised ( 150,000 ) 24.20   Forfeited —   —   Outstanding as of November 26, 2022 150,000   $ 37.67       The SARs exercised in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 resulted in a net issuance of 38,850 shares of the Company’s common stock. The SARs granted in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 are liability-classified; therefore the related stock-based compensation expense is based on the vesting provisions and the fair value of the awards.
13. Restructuring and Related Charges      In May 2020, the Company announced certain restructuring activities in conjunction with the implementation of the Company’s future-state organization design, which created a fully integrated organization with its completed acquisition of Quest Nutrition, LLC on November 7, 2019. The new organization design became effective on August 31, 2020. These restructuring plans primarily included workforce reductions, changes in management structure, and the relocation of business activities from one location to another.     The Company substantially completed its restructuring activities during the third quarter of fiscal 2022; therefore
no
restructuring or restructuring-related costs were incurred in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022. In the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, the Company incurred an immaterial amount of restructuring and restructuring-related costs. Since the announcement of the restructuring activities in May 2020, the Company incurred aggregate restructuring and restructuring-related costs of $ 9.9  million.

Factors that could cause such differences include those identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.      Unless the context requires otherwise in this Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Simply Good Foods” refer to The Simply Good Foods Company and its subsidiaries. Overview
The Simply Good Foods Company is a consumer packaged food and beverage company that aims to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements, and other product offerings. The product portfolio we develop, market and sell consists primarily of protein bars, ready-to-drink (“RTD”) shakes, sweet and salty snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Atkins®, Atkins Endulge®, Quest® and Quest Hero TM
brand names. We believe Simply Good Foods is poised to expand its wellness platform through innovation and organic growth along with acquisition opportunities in the nutritional snacking space.     Our nutritious snacking platform consists of brands that specialize in providing products for consumers that follow certain nutritional philosophies and health-and-wellness trends: Atkins® for those following a low-carb lifestyle and Quest® for consumers seeking a variety of protein-rich foods and beverages that also limit sugars and simple carbs. We distribute our products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club, and mass merchandise, as well as through e-commerce, convenience, specialty, and other channels. Our portfolio of nutritious snacking brands gives us a strong platform with which to introduce new products, expand distribution, and attract new consumers to our products. Business Trends     We continue to actively monitor the impact of the dynamic macroeconomic inflationary environment in the United States and elsewhere, elevated levels of supply chain cost inflation, and the level of consumer mobility, which includes the rate at which consumers return to working outside the home. Current or future governmental policies may increase the risk of inflation and possible economic recession, which could further increase the costs of ingredients, packaging and finished goods for our business as well as negatively effect consumer behavior and demand for our products. Additionally, management is continuing to monitor the conflict in Ukraine, especially regarding the availability and cost of raw materials that are produced in this region and Europe in general. Management is also monitoring for signs of any expansion of economic or supply chain disruptions or broader supply chain inflationary costs resulting either directly or indirectly from the crisis in Eastern Europe.     During the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022, our business performance was affected by the corresponding unfavorable effects of higher raw material costs, higher co-manufacturing costs, higher freight and logistics costs, and supply chain challenges, including supply chain disruptions resulting from labor shortages and disruptions in ingredients, and we expect these inflationary cost pressures and supply chain challenges to continue for the remainder of fiscal year 2023.
18 Table of Contents
We continue to proactively engage with our retail customers, contract manufacturers, and logistics and transportation providers, to meet demand for our products and to remain informed of any challenges within our business operations. Additionally, we instituted price increases effective in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022. Management believes these price increases and additional cost savings initiatives will partially offset the unfavorable effects of the supply chain cost pressures discussed above.     The ultimate effect the supply chain challenges, cost pressures, current high inflation environment, and the possible economic recession discussed above could have on consumer purchasing patterns and on our business continue to be not fully known.     Based on information available to us as of the date of this Report, we believe we will be able to deliver products at acceptable levels to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis; therefore, we expect our products will continue to be available for purchase to meet consumer meal replacement and snacking needs for the foreseeable future. We continue to monitor customer and consumer demand along with our supply chain and logistics capabilities and intend to adapt our plans as needed to continue to drive our business and meet our obligations. Key Financial Definitions      Net sales.
Net sales consist primarily of product sales less the cost of promotional activities, slotting fees and other sales credits and adjustments, including product returns.      Cost of goods sold.
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs we pay to our contract manufacturing partners to produce the products sold. These costs include the purchase of raw ingredients, packaging, shipping and handling, warehousing, depreciation of warehouse equipment, and a tolling charge for the contract manufacturer. Cost of goods sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.      Operating expenses.
Operating expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense. The following is a brief description of the components of operating expenses: • Selling and marketing.
Selling and marketing expenses comprise broker commissions, customer marketing, media and other marketing costs. • General and administrative.
General and administrative expenses comprise expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our business, including employee compensation, stock-based compensation, professional services, integration costs, restructuring costs, insurance and other general corporate expenses. • Depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization costs consist of costs associated with the depreciation of fixed assets and capitalized leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets. Results of Operations     During the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022, our net sales increased $19.6 million, or 7.0%, and our gross profit decreased $5.6 million, or 4.8%, compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 were positively affected by the price increase effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and both the Atkins® and Quest® brands experienced sales growth driven by increased e-commerce sales volume. However, unfavorable effects of higher raw material and co-manufacturing costs and supply chain challenges in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 resulted in decreased gross profit and gross profit margin as compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. As previously discussed above in “Business Trends,” we expect these inflationary cost pressures and supply chain challenges to continue for the remainder of fiscal year 2023.     In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a number of key performance indicators used by management and typically used by our competitors, including the non-GAAP measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. See “Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below for a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each applicable period. 19 Table of Contents

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial metric. See “Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each applicable period.      Net sales . Net sales of $300.9 million represented an increase of $19.6 million, or 7.0%, for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the price increase effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and e-commerce sales volume growth for both the Atkins® and Quest® brands, which increased our North America net sales by 7.8% in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The increase in North America net sales was partially offset by a 16.5% decline in our international business and a 1.1% headwind to net sales growth related to our shift from direct sales to licensing the Quest® frozen pizza business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.      Cost of goods sold .
Cost of goods sold increased $25.2 million, or 15.3%, for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The cost of goods sold increase was driven by higher raw material, packaging, and co-manufacturing costs and supply chain challenges for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 as well as sales volume growth for both the Atkins® and Quest® brands, as discussed above. As previously discussed above in “Business Trends,” we expect these inflationary cost pressures and supply chain challenges to continue for the remainder of fiscal year 2023.

Gross profit.
Gross profit decreased $5.6 million, or 4.8%, for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. Additionally, gross profit of $111.0 million, or 36.9% of net sales, for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 decreased 450 basis points from 41.4% of net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily driven by the unfavorable effects of higher raw material, packaging, and co-manufacturing costs and supply chain challenges in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 as previously discussed. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable effects of the price increase which became effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022.      Operating expenses . Operating expenses remained approximately flat at $58.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021 due to the following: • Selling and marketing.
Selling and marketing
expenses decreased $2.0 million, or 6.5%, for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, primarily related to the timing of marketing spend, which was partially offset by increased production costs related to television commercials. • General and administrative.
General and administrative expenses increased $1.9 million, or 8.2%, for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation and increased corporate and employee related expenses. These increases were partially offset by the discontinuation of costs related to business integration activities and restructuring charges in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to costs totaling $0.1 million in the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. • Depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization expenses were $4.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021.      Interest expense .
Interest expense increased $0.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, primarily due to the increase in interest rates on our Term Facility (as defined below) to 7.7% as of November 26, 2022 from 4.8% as of November 27, 2021. The increase was partially offset by the effect of principal payments reducing the outstanding balance of the Term Facility to $400.0 million as of November 26, 2022 from $431.5 million as of November 27, 2021. Additionally, interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount decreased $0.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the
thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021.      Loss in fair value change of warrant liability.
During thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, we recorded a non-cash loss of $17.3 million related to changes in valuation of our liability-classified warrants issued through a private placement (“Private Warrants”), which was primarily driven by movements in our stock price. On January 7, 2022, the Private Warrants were exercised on a cashless basis, resulting in a net issuance of 4,830,761 shares of common stock. As a result, there were no outstanding liability-classified Private Warrants during the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022.      Gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions.
Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of $0.1 million and a loss of $0.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021, respectively. The variance is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates related to our international operations.      Income tax expense.
Income tax expense decreased $3.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The decrease in our income tax expense was primarily driven by lower income from operations and changes in permanent differences .      Net income . Net income was $35.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022, an increase of $14.7 million compared to net income of $21.2 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by the $17.3 million non-cash fair value loss incurred in the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021 related to the measurement of our liability-classified Private Warrants. The increase in net income was partially offset by the decreased income from operations driven by the unfavorable effects of higher raw material and co-manufacturing costs and supply chain challenges in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022.
Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million, or 7.4% for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, driven primarily by the decrease in income from operations as a result of the unfavorable effects of higher raw material and co-manufacturing costs and supply chain challenges in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 as discussed above. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see “Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below. 21 Table of Contents
Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as alternatives to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). The Company defines EBITDA as net income or loss before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude the following items: stock-based compensation expense, integration costs, restructuring costs, gain or loss in fair value change of warrant liability, and other non-core expenses. The Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, when used in conjunction with net income, are useful to provide additional information to investors. Management of the Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to supplement net income because these measures reflect operating results of the on-going operations, eliminate items that are not directly attributable to the Company’s underlying operating performance, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics the Company’s management uses in its financial and operational decision making. The Company also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in the non-GAAP calculation.     The following unaudited table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 and November 27, 2021: (In thousands) Thirteen Weeks Ended November 26, 2022 November 27, 2021 Net income $ 35,860  $ 21,152  Interest income (7) (1) Interest expense 7,055  6,371  Income tax expense 9,696  12,823  Depreciation and amortization 4,952  4,741  EBITDA 57,556  45,086  Stock-based compensation expense 3,313  2,605  Integration of Quest —  55  Restructuring —  42  Loss in fair value change of warrant liability —  17,317  Other

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview     We have historically funded our operations with cash flow from operations and, when needed, with borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). Our principal uses of cash have been working capital, debt service, repurchases of our common stock, and acquisition opportunities.     We had $54.1 million in cash as of November 26, 2022. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. As circumstances warrant, we may issue debt and/or equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. We make no assurance that we can issue and sell such securities on acceptable terms or at all.     Our material future cash requirements from contractual and other obligations relate primarily to our principal and interest payments for our Term Facility, as defined and discussed below, and our operating and finance leases. Refer to Note 5, Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit, and Note 8, Leases, of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information related to the expected timing and amount of payments related to our contractual and other obligations. Debt and Credit Facilities     On July 7, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and other parties (as amended to date, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement at that time provided for (i) a term facility of $200.0 million (“Term Facility”) with a seven-year maturity and (ii) a revolving credit facility of up to $75.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a five-year maturity. Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the business combination which formed the Company between Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. and NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. on July 7, 2017, the full $200.0 million of the Term Facility (the “Term Loan”) was drawn.
On November 7, 2019, we entered into a second amendment (the “Incremental Facility Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to increase the principal borrowed on the Term Facility by $460.0 million. The Term Facility together with the incremental borrowing make up the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the Incremental Facility Amendment). The Incremental Facility Amendment was executed to partially finance the acquisition of Quest Nutrition, LLC on November 7, 2019. No amounts under the Term Facility were repaid as a result of the execution of the Incremental Facility Amendment.     Effective as of December 16, 2021, we entered into a third amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Extension Amendment provided for an extension of the stated maturity date of the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) from July 7, 2022 to the earlier of (i) 91 days prior to the then-effective maturity date of the Initial Term Loans and (ii) December 16, 2026.     On January 21, 2022, we entered into a repricing amendment (the “2022 Repricing Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The 2022 Repricing Amendment, among other things, (i) reduced the interest rate per annum applicable to the Initial Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of the 2022 Repricing Amendment, (ii) reset the prepayment premium for the existing Initial Term Loans to apply to Repricing Transactions (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that occur within six months after the effective date of the 2022 Repricing Amendment, and (iii) implemented the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and related replacement provisions for the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).     Effective as of the 2022 Repricing Amendment dated January 21, 2022, the interest rate per annum is based on either: i. A base rate equaling the higher of (a) the “prime rate,” (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, or (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) applicable for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% plus (x) 2.25% margin for the Term Loan or (y) 2.00% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility; or
ii. SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment equal to 0.10% for one-month SOFR, 0.15% for up to three-month SOFR and 0.25% for up to six-month SOFR, subject to a floor of 0.50%, plus (x) 3.25% margin for the Term Loan or (y) 3.00% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility.     The Simply Good Foods Company is not a borrower under the Credit Agreement and has not provided a guarantee of the Credit Agreement. Simply Good Foods USA, Inc., is the administrative borrower and certain other subsidiary holding companies are co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement. Each of our domestic subsidiaries that is not a named borrower under the Credit Agreement has provided a guarantee on a secured basis. As security for the payment or performance of the debt under the Credit Agreement, the borrowers and the guarantors have pledged certain equity interests in their respective subsidiaries and granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of their domestic assets. All guarantors other than Quest Nutrition, LLC are holding companies with no assets other than their investments in their respective subsidiaries. 23 Table of Contents
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders, and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 6.00:1.00 contingent on credit extensions in excess of 30% of the total amount of commitments available under the Revolving Credit Facility. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may result in an event of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of November 26, 2022 and August 27, 2022, respectively.
At November 26, 2022, the outstanding balance of the Term Facility was $400.0 million. We are not required to make principal payments on the Term Facility over the twelve months following the period ended November 26, 2022. The outstanding balance of the Term Facility is due upon its maturity in July 2024. As of November 26, 2022, there were no amounts drawn against the Revolving Credit Facility. Stock Repurchase Program     On October 21, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the addition of $50.0 million to our stock repurchase program, resulting in authorized stock repurchases of up to an aggregate of $150.0 million. During the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022, we repurchased 546,346 shares of common stock for $16.4 million, averaging a purchase price per share of $30.11. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021.     As of November 26, 2022, approximately $71.5 million remained available for repurchases under our $150.0 million stock repurchase program. Refer to Note 10, Stockholders’ Equity, of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information related to our stock repurchase program. Cash Flows     The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands): Thirteen Weeks Ended November 26, 2022 November 27, 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 8,718  $ (7,329) Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,238) $ (4,377) Net cash used in financing activities $ (20,761) $ (27,992)      Operating activities.
Our net cash provided by operating activities increased $16.0 million to $8.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to cash used in operating activities of $7.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to changes in working capital, comprised of changes in accounts receivable, net, inventories, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which are driven by the timing of payments and receipts and seasonal building of inventory. Changes in working capital consumed cash of $47.6 million in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to $61.4 million of cash consumed in the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. Additionally, cash paid for taxes decreased $8.8 million to an immaterial amount for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 as compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. These increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by the $5.5 million decrease in income from operations to $52.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 as compared to $58.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021, primarily attributable to the higher raw material and co-manufacturing costs and supply chain challenges as discussed in “Results of Operations” above. Additionally, cash paid for interest was $6.4 million in the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022, which was an increase of $0.7 million as compared to the $5.7 million paid for interest in the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021.      Investing activities . Our net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to $4.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. Our net cash used in investing activities for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 primarily comprised $1.2 million of purchases of property and equipment. The $4.4 million of net cash used in investing activities for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021 primarily comprised $2.7 million of purchases of property and equipment and the issuance of a $1.5 million note receivable. 24 Table of Contents
Financing activities . Our net cash used in financing activities was $20.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 compared to $28.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021. Net cash used in financing activities for the thirteen weeks ended November 26, 2022 primarily consisted of $16.4 million in repurchases in common stock, $6.5 million in principal payments on the Term Facility, and $2.3 million in tax payments related to issuance of restricted stock units and performance stock units, partially offset by $4.6 million of cash proceeds received from option exercises. Net cash used in financing activities for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2021 primarily consisted of $25.0 million in principal payments on the Term Facility and $3.2 million in tax payments related to issuance of restricted stock units and performance stock units.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
There were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the thirteen week period ended November 26, 2022. We continue to expect to experience logistics challenges in our supply chain as well as higher raw material costs, higher freight and logistics costs, and supply chain challenges in fiscal year 2023. In addition, current or future governmental policies may increase the risk of inflation and possible economic recession, which could further increase the costs of ingredients, packaging and finished goods for our business as well as negatively effect consumer behavior and demand for our products. As a result, we instituted price increases effective in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022. However, there can be no assurance that the price increases will fully offset the effects of higher raw material and supply and distribution costs on our results of operations and financial condition. For a discussion of our market risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report. Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosures.     Management, including the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of November 26, 2022, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 26, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 26 Table of Contents
PART II. Other Information Item 1.    Legal Proceedings     From time to time, we have been and may again become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any litigation that we believe to be material and we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors     Readers should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or future results. There have been no material changes in our risk factors included in our Annual Report. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.

million. As of November 26, 2022, approximately $ 71.5
million remained available under the stock repurchase program. Under the stock repurchase program, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specific period of time. We may suspend or discontinue the stock repurchase program at any time, and the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Item 3.    Defaults Upon Senior Securities
