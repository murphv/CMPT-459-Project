NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Basis of Presentation The financial information for Viavi Solutions Inc. (VIAVI also referred to as the Company) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 is unaudited, and includes all normal and recurring adjustments the Company’s management considers necessary for a fair statement of the financial information set forth herein. The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, such information does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements. For further information, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended July 2, 2022. There have been no material changes to the Company’s accounting policies during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the significant accounting policies presented in “Note 1. Basis of Presentation” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended July 2, 2022 on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on August 19, 2022. The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 2, 2022 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year ending July 1, 2023 or any future periods. Fiscal Years The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to June 30th. The Company’s fiscal 2023 is a 52-week year ending on July 1, 2023. The Company’s fiscal 2022 was a 52-week year ending on July 2, 2022.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 8 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amount of net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of commitments and contingencies during the reporting periods. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and assumptions about future periods that are believed to be reasonable based on available information. The Company’s reported financial positions or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to significant accounting policies. If estimates or assumptions differ from actual results, subsequent periods are adjusted to reflect readily available current information. We operate globally and sell our products in countries throughout the world. Recent escalation in regional conflicts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, resulting in ongoing economic sanctions, and the risk of increased tensions between China and Taiwan, could curtail or prohibit our ability to transfer certain technologies, to sell our products and solutions, or to continue to operate in certain locations. Moreover, international conflict has resulted in increased pressure on the supply chain and could further result in increased energy costs, which could increase the cost of manufacturing, selling and delivering products and solutions; inflation, which could result in increases in the cost of manufacturing products, reduced customer purchasing power, increased price pressure, and reduced or cancelled orders; increased risk of cybersecurity attacks; and general market instability, all of which could adversely impact our financial results. As a result of the restrictions on exports to Russia, we suspended transactions in the region effective February 2022, which has negatively impacted our business. While sales in this jurisdiction are not material to our total consolidated revenues or net income, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstances that would require an update to the estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, these estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates, assumptions or conditions due to risks and uncertainties, including the ongoing geopolitical instability as well as the potential for additional trade actions or retaliatory cyber-attacks aimed at infrastructure or supply chains, the impact on our future operations and results remains uncertain.
The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus and global slowdown of economic activity could continue to impact demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from the Company’s customers, while also continuing to disrupt sales channels and marketing activities for an unknown period of time. New and potentially more contagious variants of the virus have emerged over the course of the pandemic, along with a surge in cases in several regions across the globe, including Europe and Asia, resulting in renewed shutdown, mandatory quarantines and shelter in place orders in certain regions. The reopening of China and ending of its “zero-Covid” policy could have unforeseen impacts on our operations and facilities. These events have led, at times, to slowdowns in shipping and commercial activities. Through continued economic challenges, there continue to be periodic shipping and logistics challenges and continued supply chain constraints, shortages and delays, along with inflationary pricing pressures. While the Company expects that all of this could have a negative impact to its sales and its results of operations, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstances that would require an update to the estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates, assumptions or conditions.
9 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10
Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance . ASU 2021-10 requires annual disclosures about transactions with a government entity that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model including the disclosure of the types of assistance, an entity's accounting for the assistance, and the effect of the assistance on an entity's financial statements. ASU 2021-10 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted the ASU on July 3, 2022 with no material impact expected to disclosures in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2023.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815),
which clarifies guidance on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets. The amendments in this update expand the current last-of-layer method of hedge accounting that permits only one hedged layer to allow multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio. To reflect that expansion, the last-of-layer method is renamed the portfolio layer method. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),
which eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings for creditors in ASC 310 and amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination. The ASU also updates the requirements related to the accounting for credit losses under ASC 326 and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions , which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. This guidance also requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance is required to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption of the amendments recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04
Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which makes a number of changes meant to add certain disclosure requirements for a buyer in a supplier finance program. The amendments require a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program’s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period, and associated rollforward information. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period must be disclosed in interim periods. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 10 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC.

On October 5, 2022, the Company acquired all of the equity of Jackson Labs Technologies, LLC (Jackson Labs), a privately held company which specializes in Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) solutions for critical infrastructure serving both military and civilian applications. The acquisition enables the Company to broaden its solutions offering into the rapidly developing PNT landscape. The total purchase consideration includes approximately $ 49.9  million paid in cash at closing and additional contingent consideration of up to $ 117.0  million for which future cash payments are dependent on the achievement of certain operational and revenue targets over the course of a
three-year
period beginning in January 2023. The cash consideration paid at closing includes escrow payments of $ 5.0  million for indemnity holdback and $ 2.0  million subject to final cash and net working capital adjustments. The acquisition meets the definition of a business and has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance on business combinations; therefore, the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs incurred were approximately $ 0.8  million and have been recorded within SG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 12 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 7. Investments and Forward Contracts
Short-Term Investments As of December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022 the Company’s short-term investments of $ 1.4
million were comprised primarily of trading securities related to the deferred compensation plan, of which $ 1.0
million was invested in equity securities, $ 0.3
million was invested in debt securities and $ 0.1
million was invested in money market instruments.
Trading securities are reported at fair value, with the unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of Interest income and other income, net. Non-Designated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts The Company has foreign subsidiaries that operate and sell the Company’s products in various markets around the world. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risks. The Company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily certain short-term intercompany receivables and payables, and to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows related to foreign-currency transactions. The Company does not use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had forward contracts that were effectively closed but not settled with the counterparties as of the balance sheet date. Therefore, the fair value of these contracts of $ 8.4
million and $ 2.4
million is reflected as prepayments and other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively. As of July 2, 2022, the fair value of these contracts of $ 3.8
million and $ 8.4
million is reflected as prepayments and other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively. The forward contracts outstanding and not effectively closed, with a term of less than  120  days, were transacted near quarter end; therefore, the fair value of the contracts is not significant. As of December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022, the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase foreign currencies were $ 95.6
million and $ 119.1
million, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell foreign currencies were $ 26.2
million and $ 80.5
million, respectively.
The change in the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is recorded as gain or loss in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of Interest income and other income, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts are classified as operating activities. The foreign exchange forward contracts incurred a gain of $ 6.0
million and a loss of $ 0.7  million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and losses of $ 0.7  million and $ 2.5  million for the three and six months ended January 1, 2022, respectively. 17 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 8. Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. There is an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs which market participants would use in valuing an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs which reflect the assumptions market participants would use in valuing an asset or liability. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: • Level 1: includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active markets. Level 1 assets of the Company include money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities as they are traded with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.
• Level 2: includes financial instruments for which the valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 instruments of the Company generally include certain U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate and municipal bonds and notes, asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit, foreign currency forward contracts and debt. To estimate their fair value, the Company utilizes pricing models based on market data. The significant inputs for the valuation model usually include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker and dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data, and industry and economic events.
• Level 3: includes financial instruments for which fair value is derived from valuation-based inputs, that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Company’s Level 3 instruments consist of contingent purchase consideration liabilities related to business acquisitions. The fair value of such earn-out liabilities generally determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation that includes significant unobservable inputs such as the risk-adjusted discount rate, gross profit volatility, and projected financial forecast of acquired business over the earn-out period. The fair value of certain earn-out liabilities is derived using the estimated probability of success of achieving the earn-out milestones discounted to present value. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is remeasured at each reporting period at the estimated fair value based on the inputs on the date of remeasurement, with the change in fair value recognized in the Selling, general and administrative expense of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 18 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC.

The Company recorded a loss of $ 3.1  million in connection with the settlement transactions which is presented as Loss on convertible note settlement in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of the 2023 and 2024 Notes was $ 68.1  million and $ 223.9  million, respectively, in each case, with terms unchanged. Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility On December 30, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo) as administrative agent, and other lender related parties. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of $ 300
million, which matures on December 30, 2026. The Credit Agreement also provides that, under certain circumstances, the Company may increase the aggregate amount of revolving commitments thereunder by an aggregate amount of up to $ 100
million so long as certain conditions are met.
The proceeds from the credit facility established under the Credit Agreement will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and those of its subsidiaries that are borrowers and guarantors under the Credit Agreement. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrue interest as follows: (i) if the amounts outstanding are denominated in US Dollars, at a per annum rate equal to either, at the Company’s election, Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a margin of
1.35 % to
1.85 % per annum, or a specified base rate plus a margin of
0.25 % to
0.75 %, in each case, depending on the average excess availability under the facility, (ii) if the amounts outstanding are denominated in Sterling, at a per annum rate equal to the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (SONIA) plus a margin of
1.2825 % to
1.7825 %, depending on the average excess availability under the facility, (iii) if the amounts outstanding are denominated in Euros, at a per annum rate equal to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin of
1.25 % to
1.75 %, depending on the average excess availability under the facility, or (iv) if the amounts outstanding are denominated in Canadian Dollars, at a per annum rate equal to either, at the Company’s election, the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus a margin of
1.25 % to
1.75 %, or a specified base rate plus a margin of
0.25 % to
0.75 %, in each case, depending on the average excess availability under the facility. The covenants of the Credit Agreement include customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens and make certain acquisitions, investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments.
In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least
1.00
to 1.00 if excess availability under the facility is less than the greater of
10 % of the lesser of maximum revolver amount and borrowing base and $ 20
million. As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings under this facility and our available borrowing capacity was approximately $ 169.6
million. Revolving Credit Facility On May 5, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo as administrative agent, and other lender related parties. The Company borrowed $ 150
million and repaid $ 150
million under this Credit Agreement during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In connection with the entry into the Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility noted above, the Company terminated this facility. 23 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC.

Leases The Company is a lessee in several operating leases, primarily real estate facilities for office space. The Company's lease arrangements are comprised of operating leases with various expiration dates through March 31, 2042. The Company's leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the total operating lease costs were $ 3.2
million and $ 3.7  million, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the total operating lease costs were $ 6.5  million and $ 7.2  million, respectively. Total variable lease costs were immaterial during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022. The total operating costs were included in cost of revenues, research and development, and selling, general and administrative in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term was
7.1
years, and the weighted-average discount rate was
4.6 %. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities were $ 3.6
million and $ 3.5  million, respectively; and operating right-of-use (ROU) assets obtained in exchange of new operating lease liabilities were $ 2.3
million and $ 6.4  million, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities were $ 8.2  million and $ 8.7  million, respectively; and operating ROU assets obtained in exchange of new operating lease liabilities were $ 3.0  million and $ 6.5  million, respectively. The balance sheet information related to the Company’s operating leases is as follows ( in millions ): December 31, 2022 Other non-current assets $ 40.3   Total operating ROU assets $ 40.3   Other current liabilities $ 9.8   Other non-current liabilities 29.1   Total operating lease liabilities $ 38.9   24 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Future minimum operating lease payments as of December 31, 2022 are as follows ( in millions ): Fiscal Years Operating Leases Remainder of 2023 $ 4.2   2024 10.0   2025 7.8   2026 6.0   2027 4.7   Thereafter 13.0   Total lease payments 45.7   Less: Interest ( 6.8 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 38.9   Note 13. Income Taxes The Company recorded an income tax provision of $ 10.5
million and $ 22.7
million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $ 2.3
million and $ 15.9
million for the three and six months ended January 1, 2022, respectively.
The income tax provision for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 primarily relates to income tax in certain foreign and state jurisdictions based on the Company’s forecasted pre-tax income or loss.
The income tax provision recorded differs from the expected tax provision that would be calculated by applying the federal statutory rate to the Company’s income from continuing operations before taxes primarily due to the changes in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets attributable to the Company’s domestic and foreign income from continuing operations.
As of December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022, the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits totaled $ 50.3
million and $ 49.7
million, respectively, and are included in deferred taxes and other non-current tax liabilities, net. The Company had $ 2.6
million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022. The timing and resolution of income tax examinations is uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued for each year.
Although the Company does not expect that our balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next 12 months, given the uncertainty in the development of ongoing income tax examinations, the Company is unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to this balance. Note 14. Stockholders' Equity
Repurchase of Common Stock In September 2022 the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan (“2022 Repurchase Plan”) of up to $ 300  million effective October 1, 2022 which will remain in effect until the amount authorized has been fully repurchased or until suspension or termination of the program. Under the 2022 Repurchase Plan, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The timing of repurchases under the plan will depend upon business and financial market conditions. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased
2.2  million shares of its common stock for $ 25.2  million under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had remaining authorization of $ 274.8  million for future share repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. 25 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The 2022 Repurchase Plan replaces the $ 200  million stock repurchase plan that the Board previously authorized in September 2019 (“2019 Repurchase Plan”) and expired on September 30, 2022. During the three months ended October 1, 2022, the Company repurchased
1.3
million shares of its common stock for $ 18.7
million under the 2019 Repurchase Plan.
Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation The Company's stock-based compensation includes a combination of time-based restricted stock awards and performance-based awards. Restricted stock awards are granted without an exercise price and are converted to shares immediately upon vesting. When converted into shares upon vesting, shares equivalent in value to the minimum withholding taxes liability on the vested shares are withheld by the Company for the payment of such taxes. The Company generally estimates the fair value of stock-based awards based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock. In the case of performance-based awards that include a market condition, the Company will estimate the fair value of the award using a combination of the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date and the Monte Carlo simulation model. For performance-based awards, shares attained over target upon vesting are reflected as awards granted during the period. Time-based restricted stock awards granted to eligible employees will generally vest in annual installments over a period of
three
to
four years
subject to the employees’ continuing service to the Company and do not have an expiration date. The Company's performance-based awards may include performance conditions, market conditions, time-based service conditions or a combination thereof and are generally expected to vest over
one
to
four years . In addition, the actual number of shares awarded upon vesting of performance-based grants may vary from the target shares depending upon the achievement of the relevant performance or market-based conditions.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company granted
2.6  million and
2.1  million time-based restricted stock awards, respectively. The aggregate grant-date fair value of time-based restricted stock awards granted during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were estimated to be $ 36.7  million and $ 35.0  million, respectively.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company granted
0.7  million and
0.4  million, performance-based awards, respectively. In addition, during the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted an additional
0.1
million shares due to performance-based shares attained over target. There were
no
performance-based shares attained over target during the six months ended January 1, 2022. The aggregate grant-date fair value of performance-based awards granted during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were estimated to be $ 11.5  million and $ 7.9  million, respectively. The majority of performance-based awards vest in equal annual installments over
four years
based on the attainment of certain performance measures and the employee’s continued service through the vest date.
As of December 31, 2022, $ 81.3  million of unrecognized stock-based compensation costs remain to be amortized. 26 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The impact on the Company’s results of operations of recording stock-based compensation by function for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Cost of revenues $ 1.2   $ 1.2   $ 2.4   $ 2.8   Research and development $ 2.0   2.1   4.3   4.3   Selling, general and administrative $ 9.8   10.0   19.3   19.8   Total stock-based compensation expense $ 13.0   $ 13.3   $ 26.0   $ 26.9   Approximately $ 1.2  million of stock-based compensation was capitalized to inventory as of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022. Note 16. Employee Pension and Other Benefit Plans The Company sponsors significant qualified and non-qualified pension plans for certain past and present employees in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Germany. The Company also is responsible for the non-pension post-retirement benefit obligation assumed from a past acquisition. Most of the plans have been closed to new participants and no additional service costs are being accrued, except for certain plans in Germany assumed in connection with an acquisition in fiscal 2010. Benefits are generally based upon years of service and compensation or stated amounts for each year of service. As of December 31, 2022, the U.K. plan was fully funded while the other plans were unfunded. The Company’s policy for funded plans is to make contributions equal to or greater than the requirements prescribed by law or regulation. For unfunded plans, the Company pays the post-retirement benefits when due. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company contributed $ 0.6
million to the U.K. plan and $ 1.7
million to the other plans. The funded plan assets consist primarily of managed investments. The following table presents the components of net periodic cost for the pension and benefits plans ( in millions ):   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Service cost $ —   $ —   $ —   $ 0.1   Interest cost 0.7   0.4   1.4   0.8   Expected return on plan assets ( 0.4 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 0.9 ) Amortization of net actuarial losses —   0.7   —   1.5   Net periodic benefit cost $ 0.3   $ 0.7   $ 0.6   $ 1.5   Both the calculation of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic cost are based upon actuarial valuations. These valuations use participant-specific information such as salary, age, years of service, and assumptions about interest rates, compensation increases and other factors. At a minimum, the Company evaluates these assumptions annually and makes changes as necessary. The Company expects to incur cash outlays of approximately $ 7.9
million related to its defined benefit pension plans during fiscal 2023 to make current benefit payments and fund future obligations. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 2.3
million had been incurred. These payments have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s projected benefit obligation at July 2, 2022. 27 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings In June 2016, the Company received a court decision regarding the validity of an amendment to a pension deed of trust related to one of its foreign subsidiaries which the Company contends contained an error requiring the Company to increase the pension plan’s benefit. The Company had subsequently further amended the deed to rectify the error. The court ruled that the amendment increasing the pension plan benefit was valid until the subsequent amendment. The Company estimated the liability to range from (amounts represented as £ denote GBP) £ 5.7
million to £ 8.4
million. The Company determined the likelihood of loss to be probable and accrued £ 5.7
million as of July 2, 2016 in accordance with authoritative guidance on contingencies.
The Company pursued an appeal of the court decision. In March 2018, the appellate court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The Company pursued a motion for summary judgement on the deed of rectification claim and continues to pursue a claim against the U.K. law firm responsible for the error. As of July 2, 2022, the related accrued pension liability of £ 5.4
million or $ 6.5
million was included in pension and post-employment benefits within other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In September 2022, the Company received a favorable court decision which removed completely and definitively the obligation to fund the increased pension benefit with retrospective effect to 1999. As a result of the judgment, and in accordance with authoritative guidance on contingencies, the Company reversed the liability and recorded a gain (reduction to Selling, general and administrative expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations) of £ 5.7
million or $ 6.7
million during the three months ended October 1, 2022. The Company is subject to a variety of claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against the Company, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. Guarantees Outstanding Letters of Credit, Performance Bonds and Other Claims As of December 31, 2022, the Company had standby letters of credit of $ 11.9
million, performance bonds and other claims of $ 0.9
million collateralized by restricted cash.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 18. Operating Segments and Geographic Information
The Company evaluates its reportable segments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on segment reporting. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), uses operating segment financial information to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. The Company’s reportable segments are: (i) Network Enablement: NE provides an integrated portfolio of testing solutions that access the network to perform build-out and maintenance tasks. These solutions include instruments, software and services to design, build, turn-up, certify, troubleshoot and optimize networks. The Company also offers a range of product support and professional services such as repair, calibration, software support and technical assistance for its products. NE’s avionics products provide test and measuring solutions for aviation, aerospace, government, defense, communications and public safety. (ii) Service Enablement: SE provides embedded systems and enterprise performance management solutions that give global communications service providers, enterprises and cloud operators visibility into network, service and application data. These solutions—including instruments, microprobes and software—monitor, collect and analyze network data to reveal the actual customer experience and to identify opportunities for new revenue streams and network optimization. (iii) Optical Security and Performance Products: OSP leverages its core optical coating technologies and volume manufacturing capability to design, manufacture, and sell technologies for the anti-counterfeiting, consumer electronics, industrial, government and automotive markets. Segment Reporting The CODM manages the Company in
two
broad business categories: NSE and OSP. The CODM evaluates segment performance of the NSE business based on the combined segment gross and operating margins. Operating expenses associated with the NSE business are not allocated to the individual segments within NSE, as they are managed centrally at the business unit level. The CODM evaluates segment performance of the OSP business based on segment operating margin. The Company allocates corporate-level operating expenses to its segment results, except for certain non-core operating and non-operating activities as discussed below. The Company does not allocate stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangibles, restructuring and related charges, impairment of goodwill, non-operating income and expenses, changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, or other charges unrelated to core operating performance to its segments because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. These items are presented as “Other Items” in the table below. Additionally, the Company does not specifically identify and allocate all assets by operating segment. 29 Table of Contents VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC.

three
geographic regions: Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Net revenue is assigned to the geographic region and country where the Company’s product is initially shipped. For example, certain customers may request shipment of the Company’s product to a contract manufacturer in one country, which may differ from the location of their end customers.

Subsequent Events Restructuring plan On February 1, 2023, the Company approved a restructuring and workforce reduction plan (the Plan) intended to improve operational efficiencies and better align the Company’s workforce with current business needs and strategic growth opportunities. The Company expects approximately
5 % of its global workforce to be affected and estimates it will incur charges of approximately $ 15  million in connection with the Plan. The Company anticipates the Plan to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2023.

Overview VIAVI is a global provider of network test, monitoring, and assurance solutions for communications service providers, hyperscalers, equipment manufacturers, enterprises, government and avionics. We help customers harness the power of instruments, automation, intelligence, and virtualization. VIAVI is also a leader in light management technologies for 3D sensing, anti-counterfeiting, consumer electronics, industrial, automotive, government and aerospace applications.
Together with our customers and partners we are United in Possibility, finding innovative ways to solve real-world problems. To serve our markets we operate the following business segments: • Network Enablement (NE); • Service Enablement (SE); and, • Optical Security and Performance Products (OSP).
During the second quarter, we continued to experience a constrained demand outlook, currency headwinds, and inflationary pressures.
Any prolonged disruption of manufacturing of our products, commerce and related activity or significant decrease in demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our results of business, operations, and financial conditions.
Our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by revenue growth, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow from operations. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Restructuring plan On February 1, 2023, the Company approved a restructuring and workforce reduction plan (the Plan) intended to improve operational efficiencies and better align the Company’s workforce with current business needs and strategic growth opportunities. The Company expects approximately 5% of its global workforce to be affected and estimates it will incur charges of approximately $15 million in connection with the Plan. The Company anticipates the Plan to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2023. Looking Ahead As we look ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect the macroeconomic headwinds and end market demand volatility to persist into the near future. We remain positive on our long-term growth drivers in 5G Wireless, Fiber, 3D Sensing and Resilient PNT.
We will continue to focus on executing against our strategic priorities highlighted during our September 2022 Analyst Day Event such as: • Defend and consolidate leadership in core business segments; • Invest in secular trends to drive growth and expand Total Addressable Market (TAM); • Extend VIAVI technologies and platforms into lucrative adjacent markets and applications; and, • Continuous productivity improvement in Operations, Research & Development (R&D) and Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A). 35 Table of Contents Recent Global Events We operate globally and sell our products in countries throughout the world. Recent escalation in regional conflicts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, resulting in ongoing economic sanctions, and the risk of increased tensions between China and Taiwan, could curtail or prohibit our ability to transfer certain technologies, to sell our products and solutions, or to continue to operate in certain locations. Moreover, international conflict has resulted in increased pressure on the supply chain and could further result in increased energy costs, which could increase the cost of manufacturing, selling and delivering products and solutions; inflation, which could result in increases in the cost of manufacturing products, reduced customer purchasing power, increased price pressure, and reduced or cancelled orders; increased risk of cybersecurity attacks; and general market instability, all of which could adversely impact our financial results. As a result of the restrictions on exports to Russia, we suspended transactions in the region effective February 2022, which has negatively impacted our business. While sales in this jurisdiction are not material to our total consolidated revenues or net income, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstances that would require an update to the estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, these estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates, assumptions or conditions due to risks and uncertainties, including the ongoing geopolitical instability as well as the potential for additional trade actions or retaliatory cyber-attacks aimed at infrastructure or supply chains, the impact on our future operations and results remains uncertain.
COVID-19 Pandemic Update The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus and global slowdown of economic activity could continue to impact demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from the Company’s customers, while also continuing to disrupt sales channels and marketing activities for an unknown period of time. New and potentially more contagious variants of the virus have emerged over the course of the pandemic, along with a surge in cases in several regions across the globe, including Europe and Asia, resulting in renewed shutdown, mandatory quarantines and shelter in place orders in certain regions. The reopening of China and ending of its “zero-Covid” policy could have unforeseen impacts on our operations and facilities. These events have led, at times, to slowdowns in shipping and commercial activities. Through continued economic challenges, there continue to be periodic shipping and logistics challenges and continued supply chain constraints, shortages and delays, along with inflationary pricing pressures. While the Company expects that all of this could have a negative impact to its sales and its results of operations, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstances that would require an update to the estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates, assumptions or conditions.

(2)     The Company incurred a loss of $6.4M and $92.3M for the three and six months ended January 1, 2022 in connection with the repurchase of certain 1.00% and 1.75% Senior Convertible Notes. The Company eliminates this in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, because it believes that in so doing, it can provide investors a clearer and more consistent view of the Company’s core operating performance. 37 Table of Contents Use of Non-GAAP (Adjusted) Financial Measures The Company provides non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share financial measures as supplemental information regarding the Company’s operational performance. The Company uses the measures disclosed in this Report to evaluate the Company’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as its performance relative to its competitors. Specifically, management uses these items to further its own understanding of the Company’s core operating performance, which the Company believes represent its performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance items such as those relating to certain purchase price accounting adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation, legal settlements, restructuring, separation costs, changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and certain investing expenses and other activities that management believes are not reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and core operating activities. The Company believes excluding these items enables investors to evaluate more clearly and consistently the Company’s core operational performance.
The Company believes providing this additional information allows investors to see Company results through the eyes of management. The Company further believes that providing this information allows investors to better understand the Company’s financial performance and, importantly, to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.  The non-GAAP adjustments described in this release are excluded by the Company from its GAAP financial measures because the Company believes excluding these items enables investors to evaluate more clearly and consistently the Company’s core operational performance. The non-GAAP adjustments are outlined below. Cost of revenues, costs of research and development and costs of selling, general and administrative: The Company’s GAAP presentation of operating expenses may include (i) additional depreciation and amortization from changes in estimated useful life and the write-down of certain property, equipment and intangibles that have been identified for disposal but remained in use until the date of disposal, (ii) workforce related charges such as severance, retention bonuses and employee relocation costs related to formal restructuring plans, (iii) costs for facilities not required for ongoing operations, and costs related to the relocation of certain equipment from these facilities and/or contract manufacturer facilities, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) amortization expense related to acquired intangibles, (vi) changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and (vii) other charges unrelated to our core operating performance comprised mainly of acquisition related transaction costs, integration costs related to acquired entities, litigation and legal settlements and other costs and contingencies unrelated to current and future operations, including transformational initiatives such as the implementation of simplified automated processes, site consolidations, and reorganizations. The Company excludes these items in calculating non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share. Non-cash interest expense and other expense: The Company excludes certain investing expenses and non-cash activities that management believes are not reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and core operating activities, in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share. Income tax expense or benefit: The Company excludes certain non-cash tax expense or benefit items, such as the utilization of net operating losses where valuation allowances were released, intra-period tax allocation benefit and the tax effect for amortization of non-tax deductible intangible assets, in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, preferable to, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net income is net income. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net income per share is net income per share. The Company believes these GAAP measures alone are not fully indicative of its core operating expenses and performance and that providing non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures provides valuable supplemental information regarding the Company’s overall performance. 38 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The results of operations for the current period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for future periods.

Revenue from our service offerings exceeds 10% of our total consolidated net revenue and is presented separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Service revenue primarily consists of maintenance and support, extended warranty, professional services and post-contract support in addition to other services such as calibration and repair services. When evaluating the performance of our segments, management focuses on total net revenue, gross profit and operating income and not the product or service categories. Consequently, the following discussion of business segment performance focuses on total net revenue, gross profit, and operating income consistent with our approach for managing the business. Three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022
Net revenue decreased by $30.3 million, or 9.6%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease was due to revenue decrease from our NE and SE segments, partially offset by revenue increase in our OSP segment. Product revenues decreased by $35.9 million, or 12.9%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago, driven by revenue decreases from our NE and SE segments, partially offset by revenue increase in our OSP segment. Service revenues increased by $5.6 million, or 15.0%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was due to revenue increase from our NE and SE segments.
NE net revenue decreased by $34.7 million, or 16.2%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes in Field Instruments, Wireless and Lab & Production products compared to the prior year partially offset by Jackson Labs revenues not included in the same period a year ago. SE net revenue decreased by $2.4 million, or 8.1%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago, due to lower volumes. OSP net revenue increased by $6.8 million, or 9.6%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher volume in Anti-Counterfeiting and consumer and industrial compared to the same period a year ago. Going forward, we expect to continue to encounter a number of industry and market risks and uncertainties that may limit our visibility, and consequently, our ability to predict future revenue, seasonality, profitability, and general financial performance, which could create period over period variability in our financial measures and present foreign exchange rate risks. Additionally, we have seen demand for our NE and SE products affected by macroeconomic uncertainty. We cannot predict when or to what extent these uncertainties will be resolved. Our revenues, profitability, and general financial performance may also be affected by: (a) pricing pressures due to, among other things, a highly concentrated customer base, increasing competition, particularly from Asia-based competitors, and a general commoditization trend for certain products; (b) product mix variability in our NE and SE markets, which affects revenue and gross margin; (c) fluctuations in customer buying patterns, which cause demand, revenue and profitability volatility; (d) the current trend of communication industry consolidation, which is expected to continue, that directly affects our NE and SE customer bases and adds additional risk and uncertainty to our financial and business projections; (e) chip component shortages, supply chain and shipping logistic constraints; (f) the impact of ongoing global trade policies, tariffs and sanctions; and (g) regulatory or economic developments and/or technology challenges that slow or change the rate of adoption of 5G, 3D Sensing and other emerging secular technologies and platforms. 40 Table of Contents Revenue by Region We operate in three geographic regions: Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Net revenue is assigned to the geographic region and country where our product is initially shipped. For example, certain customers may request shipment of our product to a contract manufacturer in one country, which may differ from the location of their end customers. The following table presents net revenue by the three geographic regions we operate in and net revenue from countries that exceeded 10% of our total net revenue ( in millions ): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Americas:      United States $ 92.5  32.5  % $ 100.2  31.8  % $ 189.1  31.8  % $ 193.5  30.2  %      Other Americas 13.8  4.9  % 25.5  8.1  % 40.2  6.8  % 53.7  8.3  %           Total Americas $ 106.3  37.4  % $ 125.7  39.9  % $ 229.3  38.6  % $ 247.2  38.5  % Asia-Pacific:      Greater China $ 60.7  21.3  % $ 56.5  17.9  % $ 126.3  21.2  % $ 129.1  20.1  %      Other Asia-Pacific 44.4  15.6  % 34.5  11.0  % 90.4  15.2  % 88.2  13.8  %           Total Asia-Pacific $ 105.1  36.9  % $ 91.0  28.9  % $ 216.7  36.4  % $ 217.3  33.9  % EMEA:      Switzerland $ 11.5  4.0  % $ 11.7  3.7  % $ 29.0  4.9  % $ 24.9  3.9  %      Other EMEA 61.6  21.7  % 86.4  27.5  % 119.7  20.1  % 152.2  23.7  %           Total EMEA $ 73.1  25.7  % $ 98.1  31.2  % $ 148.7  25.0  % $ 177.1  27.6  % Total net revenue $ 284.5  100.0  % $ 314.8  100.0  % $ 594.7  100.0  % $ 641.6  100.0  % Net revenue from customers outside the Americas during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 represented 62.6% and 61.4% of net revenue, respectively. Net revenue from customers outside the Americas during the three and six months ended January 1, 2022 represented 60.1% and 61.5% of net revenue, respectively.
We expect revenue from customers outside of the United States to continue to be an important part of our overall net revenue and an increasing focus for net revenue growth opportunities. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased by 1.8 percentage points during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 60.5% in the same period a year ago to 58.7% in the current period. The decrease was primarily driven by gross margin reduction in all segments as discussed below in the Operating Segment Information section.
Gross margin decreased by 0.9 percentage points during the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 60.1% in the same period a year ago to 59.2% in the current period. The decrease was primarily driven by gross margin reduction in all segments as discussed below in the Operating Segment Information section.
As discussed in more detail under “Net Revenue” above, we sell products in certain markets that are consolidating, undergoing product, architectural and business model transitions, have high customer concentrations, are highly competitive (increasingly due to Asia-Pacific-based competition), are price sensitive and/or are affected by customer seasonal and mix variant buying patterns. We expect these factors to continue to result in variability of our gross margin. Amortization of Acquired Technologies and Other Intangibles Amortization of acquired technologies and other intangibles decreased $2.1M or 21.0% during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease is primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2022. 41 Table of Contents Amortization of acquired technologies and other intangibles decreased $3.4M or 16.5% during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease is primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2022. Research and Development R&D expense increased by $1.4 million, or 2.8%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was driven primarily by higher contractor and travel expenses. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D expense increased by 2.2 percentage points during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. R&D expense increased by $0.4 million or 0.4%, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was driven primarily by higher contractor expenses. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D expense increased by 1.4 percentage points during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. We believe that continuing our investments in R&D is critical to attaining our strategic objectives. We plan to continue to invest in R&D and new products that will further differentiate us in the marketplace. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expense increased by $1.8 million, or 2.0%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily due to fair value adjustment of contingent consideration related to acquisitions and outside service expenses.
As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A increased 3.6 percentage points during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. SG&A expense decreased by $9.8 million, or 5.4%, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of the U.K. pension accrued liability, lower commission expense and foreign exchange impacts offset by fair value adjustment of contingent consideration related to acquisitions and outside service expenses.
As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A increased 0.5 percentage points during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. Loss on convertible note exchange During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not enter into any convertible note exchange agreements.
During the three months ended January 1, 2022, the Company entered into separate privately-negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 1.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 and 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company paid $59.0 million in cash in exchange for $20.6 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes and $25.0 million principal amount of the 2024 Notes. The Company recorded a loss of $6.4 million in connection with the settlement transactions. During the six months ended January 1, 2022, the Company entered into separate privately-negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 1.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 and 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024. The Company paid an aggregate 10.6 million shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and $255.5 million in cash in exchange for $114.3 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes and $206.3 million principal amount of the 2024 Notes. The Company recorded a loss of $92.3 million in connection with the settlement transactions. Interest income and other income, net Interest income and other income, net, was $2.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1.1 million during the same period a year ago. This $1.1 million increase was primarily driven by higher interest income during the current period. 42 Table of Contents Interest income and other income, net, was $3.3 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $2.5 million during the same period a year ago. This $0.8 million increase was primarily driven by higher interest income offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact as the balance sheet hedging program provided a less favorable offset to the remeasurement of underlying foreign exchange exposures during the current period.
Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by $0.9 million, or 12.7%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense and amortization of issuance cost on our convertible notes as a result of convertible notes exchange transactions during November 2021, March 2022 and June 2022. Interest expense increased by $1.6 million, or 15.0%, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by full six month interest expense on the Senior Notes due 2029 in the current period as a result of the issuance in September 2021. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $10.5 million and $22.7 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. We recorded an income tax provision of $2.3 million and $15.9 million for the three and six months ended January 1, 2022, respectively.
The income tax provision for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 primarily relates to income tax in certain foreign and state jurisdictions based on our forecasted pre-tax income or loss.
The income tax provision recorded differs from the expected tax provision that would be calculated by applying the federal statutory rate to our income from continuing operations before taxes primarily due to the changes in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets attributable to our domestic and foreign income from continuing operations. As
of December 31, 2022, and July 2, 2022, our unrecognized tax benefits totaling $50.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively, are included in deferred taxes and other non-current tax liabilities, net. We had $2.6 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022. The timing and resolution of income tax examinations is uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised by the taxing authorities may
differ from the amounts accrued for each year. Although we do not expect that our balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next 12 months, given the uncertainty in the development of ongoing income tax examinations, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to this balance.   43 Table of Contents Operating Segment Information Information related to our operating segments were as follows, (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended   December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Percentage Change December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Percentage Change Network Enablement Net revenue $ 179.7  $ 214.4  $ (34.7) (16.2) % $ 374.6  $ 419.3  $ (44.7) (10.7) % Gross profit 115.1  138.0  (22.9) (16.6) % 240.7  270.7  (30.0) (11.1) % Gross margin 64.1  % 64.4  % 64.3  % 64.6  % Service Enablement Net revenue $ 27.4  $ 29.8  $ (2.4) (8.1) % $ 51.4  $ 52.8  $ (1.4) (2.7) % Gross profit 18.3  21.4  (3.1) (14.5) % 34.3  36.1  (1.8) (5.0) % Gross margin 66.8  % 71.8  % 66.7  % 68.4  % Network and Service Enablement Net revenue $ 207.1  $ 244.2  $ (37.1) (15.2) % $ 426.0  $ 472.1  $ (46.1) (9.8) % Operating income 18.5  45.6  (27.1) (59.4) % 47.3  76.3  (29.0) (38.0) % Operating margin 8.9  % 18.7  % 11.1  % 16.2  % Optical Security and Performance Net revenue $ 77.4  $ 70.6  $ 6.8  9.6  % $ 168.7  $ 169.5  $ (0.8) (0.5) % Gross profit 40.5  39.7  0.8  2.0  % 92.3  96.8  (4.5) (4.6) % Gross margin 52.3  % 56.2  % 54.7  % 57.1  % Operating income 27.5  27.7  (0.2) (0.7) % 66.1  71.3  (5.2) (7.3) % Operating margin 35.5  % 39.2  % 39.2  % 42.1  % Network Enablement During the three months ended December 31, 2022, NE gross margin decreased by 0.3 percentage points from 64.4% in the same period a year ago to 64.1% in the current period, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable product mix. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, NE gross margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points from 64.6% in the same period a year ago to 64.2% in the current period, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable product mix. Service Enablement During the three months ended December 31, 2022, SE gross margin decreased by 5.0 percentage points from 71.8% in the same period a year ago to 66.8% in the current period. This decrease was primarily due to
unfavorable product mix. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, SE gross margin decreased by 1.6 percentage points from 68.4% in the same period a year ago to 66.8% in the current period. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable product mix. Network and Service Enablement During the three months ended December 31, 2022, NSE operating margin decreased by 9.8 percentage points from 18.7% in the same period a year ago to 8.9% in the current period. This decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by lower volumes and unfavorable product mix. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, NSE operating margin decreased by 5.1 percentage points from 16.2% in the same period a year ago to 11.1% in the current period. This decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by lower volumes and unfavorable product mix. 44 Table of Contents Optical Security and Performance Products During the three months ended December 31, 2022, OSP gross margin decreased by 3.9 percentage points from 56.2% in the same period a year ago to 52.3% in the current period. This decrease was primarily due to
unfavorable manufacturing variances and startup costs at our Chandler facility partially offset by higher revenue. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, OSP gross margin decreased by 2.4 percentage points from 57.1% in the same period a year ago to 54.7% in the current period. This decrease was primarily due to
unfavorable manufacturing variances and startup costs at our Chandler facility. OSP operating margin decreased by 3.7 percentage points during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 39.2% in the same period a year ago to 35.5% in the current period. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to the aforementioned reduction in gross margin. OSP operating margin decreased by 2.9 percentage points during the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 42.1% in the same period a year ago to 39.2% in the current period. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to the aforementioned reduction in gross margin. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our existing liquidity and sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to be adequate to meet our liquidity needs, including but not limited to, contractual obligations, working capital and capital expenditure requirements, financing strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program over the next twelve months and beyond. However, there are a number of factors that could positively or negatively impact our liquidity position, including: • Global economic conditions which affect demand for our products and services and impact the financial stability of our suppliers and customers; • Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition; • Changes in accounts receivable, inventory or other operating assets and liabilities which affect our working capital; • Increase in capital expenditure to support the revenue growth opportunity of our business; • Changes in customer payment terms and patterns, which typically results in customers delaying payments or negotiating favorable payment terms to manage their own liquidity positions; • Timing of payments to our suppliers; • Factoring or sale of accounts receivable; • Volatility in fixed income and credit markets which impact the liquidity and valuation of our investment portfolios; • Volatility in credit markets which would impact our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all; • Volatility in foreign exchange markets which impacts our financial results; • Possible investments or acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies; • While the principal payment obligations of our 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024, our 1.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, and our 3.75% Senior Notes due 2029 (together the “Notes”) are substantial and there are covenants that restrict our debt level and credit facility capacity, we may be able to incur substantially more debt; • Issuance or repurchase of debt or equity securities, which may include open market purchases of our 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes and/or 2029 Notes prior to their maturity or of our common stock; 45 Table of Contents • Potential funding of pension liabilities either voluntarily or as required by law or regulation; • Compliance with covenants and other terms and conditions related to our financing arrangements; and • The risks and uncertainties detailed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” section of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments Our cash and cash equivalents consist mainly of investments in institutional money market funds, short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions, and similar short duration instruments. Our strategy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our investments in debt securities and marketable equity securities are primarily classified as available for sale or trading assets and are recorded at fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are recorded as other comprehensive (loss) income and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2022, U.S. subsidiaries owned approximately 40.7% of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of our cash investments have maturities of 90 days or less and are of high credit quality. Nonetheless we could realize investment losses under adverse market conditions. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we have not realized material investment losses but can provide no assurance that the value or the liquidity of our investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. In addition, we maintain cash balances in operating accounts that are with third-party financial institutions. These balances in the U.S. may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits. While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail. Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility On December 30, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo) as administrative agent, and other lender related parties. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of $300 million, which matures on December 30, 2026. The Credit Agreement also provides that, under certain circumstances, we may increase the aggregate amount of revolving commitments thereunder by an aggregate amount of up to $100 million so long as certain conditions are met. As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings under this facility and our available borrowing capacity was approximately $169.6 million. Refer to “Note 11. Debt” for more information. Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2022, our combined balance of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by $75.9 million to $496.9 million from $572.8 million as of July 2, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, Cash provided by operating activities was $72.8 million, consisting of net income of $41.0 million adjusted for non-cash charges (e.g. depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and other non-cash items) which totaled $62.8 million, including changes in deferred tax balances, and changes in operating assets and liabilities that used $31.0 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a decrease in accrued expenses and other current and non-current liabilities of $25.0 million, a decrease in accrued payroll and related expenses of $21.6 million, an increase in inventory of $14.4 million, a decrease in income taxes payable of $9.0 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $8.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $6.9 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $42.2 million and a decrease in other current and non-current assets of $12.0 million. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, Cash used in investing activities was $95.9 million, primarily related to $64.4 million of cash used for acquisitions,$32.9 million of cash used for capital expenditures and $1.0 million for a purchase price adjustment related to business acquisition, offset by $2.4 million proceeds from sales of assets. 46 Table of Contents During the six months ended December 31, 2022, Cash used in financing activities was $52.7 million, primarily resulting from $43.9 million cash paid to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, $11.2 million in withholding tax payments on the vesting of restricted stock awards and $1.3 million in other payments, primarily acquisition related. These were partially offset by $3.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.
Share Repurchase Program In September 2022 the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan (“2022 Repurchase Plan”) of up to $300 million effective October 1, 2022 which will remain in effect until the amount authorized has been fully repurchased or until suspension or termination of the program. Under the 2022 Repurchase Plan, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The timing of repurchases under the plan will depend upon business and financial market conditions. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock for $25.2 million under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had remaining authorization of $274.8 million for future share repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. The 2022 Repurchase Plan replaces the $200 million stock repurchase plan that the Board previously authorized in September 2019 (“2019 Repurchase Plan”) and expired on September 30, 2022. During the three months ended October 1, 2022, the Company repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $18.7 million under the 2019 Repurchase Plan. Refer to “Note 14. Stockholders Equity” for more information. Contractual Obligations There were no material changes to our existing contractual commitments during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in rules promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors, other than the guarantees discussed in “Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies.” Employee Equity Incentive Plan Our stock-based benefit plans are a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Refer to “Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation” for more details. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits We sponsor significant pension plans for certain past and present employees in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Germany. We are also responsible for the non-pension post-retirement benefit obligation (PBO) assumed from a past acquisition. All of these plans have been closed to new participants and no additional service costs are being accrued, except for certain plans in Germany assumed in connection with an acquisition in fiscal 2010. The U.K. plan is fully funded, and the other Germany plans, which were initially established as “pay-as-you-go” plans, are unfunded. As of December 31, 2022, our pension plans were under-funded by $58.4 million since the PBO exceeded the fair value of plan assets. Similarly, we had a liability of $0.4 million related to our non-pension post-retirement benefit plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external third parties and we monitor the performance of our investment managers. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of plan assets had decreased approximately 4.6% since July 2, 2022, our most recent fiscal year end. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions and the impact of active management of the plan’s invested assets. While it is not possible to accurately predict future rate movements, we believe our current assumptions are appropriate. Refer to “Note 16. Employee Pension and Other Benefit Plans” for more details. 47 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” regarding the effect of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (U.S. GAAP),
which require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. A key actuarial assumption in calculating the net periodic cost and the PBO is the discount rate. Changes in the discount rate impact the interest cost component of the net periodic benefit cost calculation and PBO due to the fact that the PBO is calculated on a net present value basis. Decreases in the discount rate will generally increase pre-tax cost, recognized expense and the PBO. Increases in the discount rate tend to have the opposite effect. We estimate a 50-basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate would cause a corresponding increase or decrease, respectively, in the PBO of approximately $5.0 million based upon data as of July 2, 2022. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks The Company’s market risk has not changed materially from the foreign exchange and interest rate risks disclosed in Item 7A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2022. Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures of our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems will be achieved. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company, have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective. 48 Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are subject to a variety of claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, it may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS  Global Risks Geopolitical conditions, including political turmoil and volatility, regional conflicts, terrorism and war could result in market instability, which could negatively impact our business results. We operate globally and sell our products in countries throughout the world. Recent escalation in regional conflicts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, resulting in ongoing economic sanctions, and the risk of increased tensions between China and Taiwan, could curtail or prohibit our ability to transfer certain technologies, to sell our products and solutions, or to continue to operate in certain locations. Moreover, international conflict has resulted in (i) increased pressure on the supply chain and could further result in increased energy costs, which could increase the cost of manufacturing, selling and delivering products and solutions (ii) inflation, which could result in increases in the cost of manufacturing products, reduced customer purchasing power, increased price pressure, and reduced or cancelled orders (iii) increased risk of cybersecurity attacks and (iv) general market instability, all of which could adversely impact our financial results. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect how we and our customers are operating our businesses.
The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity which could continue to impact demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from the Company’s customers, while also continuing to disrupt sales channels and marketing activities for an unknown period of time. New and potentially more contagious variants of the virus have emerged over the course of the pandemic, along with a surge in cases in several regions across the globe, including Europe and Asia, resulting in renewed shutdown, mandatory quarantines and shelter in place orders in certain regions. These events have led, at times, to slowdowns in shipping and commercial activities.
Through continued economic challenges, there continue to be periodic shipping and logistics challenges and continued supply chain constraints, shortages and delays, along with inflationary pricing pressures.
As normal business operations resume and we transition to a hybrid work model, we continue to practice enhanced sanitation procedures, health checks and social distancing protocols, however, none of these measures can completely eliminate the risk of exposure or spread of COVID-19. There could be additional waves or spikes in infection, again causing widespread social, economic and operational impacts. The reopening of China and ending of its “zero-Covid” policy could have unforeseen impacts on our operations, facilities and supply chain.
Further, the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets in many countries. In December 2021, we entered into a $300 million asset-based secured credit facility. If there is a long-term economic downturn or a prolonged recession, we could face additional liquidity needs and challenges. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all.
Any prolonged disruption of manufacturing or shipment of our products caused by the pandemic or significant decrease in demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. Surges in infection rate, new shutdowns or quarantines, emergence of new and potentially more contagious variants of the virus and staffing and labor supply challenges may impact our suppliers and our ability to source materials in a timely manner. Further, ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressure could have a negative impact on our results.
Risks Related to Our Business Strategy and Industry Our future profitability is not assured. Our profitability in a particular period will be impacted by revenue, product mix and operational costs that vary significantly across our product portfolio and business segments. 50 Table of Contents Specific factors that may undermine our profit and financial objectives include, among others: • Uncertain future telecom carrier and cable operator capital and R&D spending levels, which particularly affects our NE and SE segments;
• Adverse changes to our product mix, both fundamentally (resulting from new product transitions, the declining profitability of certain legacy products and the termination of certain products with declining margins, among other things) and due to quarterly demand fluctuations;
• Pricing pressure across our NSE product lines due to competitive forces, advanced chip component shortages, and a highly concentrated customer base for many of our product lines, which may offset some of the cost improvements;
• Our OSP operating margin may experience some downward pressure as a result of a higher mix of 3D sensing products and increased operating expenses; • Limited availability of components and resources for our products which leads to higher component prices; • Resource rationing, including rationing of utilities like electricity by governments and/or service providers;
• Increasing commoditization of previously differentiated products, and the attendant negative effect on average selling prices and profit margins; • Execution challenges, which limit revenue opportunities and harm profitability, market opportunities and customer relations; • Decreased revenue associated with terminated or divested product lines;
• Redundant costs related to periodic transitioning of manufacturing and other functions to lower-cost locations; • Ongoing costs associated with organizational transitions, consolidations and restructurings, which are expected to continue in the nearer term;
• Cyclical demand for our currency products; • Changing market and economic conditions, including the impacts due to tariffs, the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, supply chain constraints, pricing and inflationary pressures; • Ability of our customers, partners, manufacturers and suppliers to purchase, market, sell, manufacture and/or supply our products and services, including as a result of disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic;
• Financial stability of our customers, including the solvency of private sector customers and statutory authority for government customers to purchase goods and services; and
• Factors beyond our control resulting from pandemics and similar outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturing restrictions, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders to control the spread of a disease regionally and globally, and limitations on the ability of our employees and our suppliers’ and customers’ employees to work and travel.
Taken together, these factors limit our ability to predict future profitability levels and to achieve our long-term profitability objectives. If we fail to achieve profitability expectations, the price of our debt and equity securities, as well as our business and financial condition, may be materially adversely impacted. 51 Table of Contents Rapid technological change in our industry presents us with significant risks and challenges, and if we are unable to keep up with the rapid changes, our customers may purchase less of our products. The manufacture, quality and distribution of our products, as well as our customer relations, may be affected by several factors, including the rapidly changing market for our products, supply chain issues and internal restructuring efforts. We expect the impact of these issues will become more pronounced as we continue to introduce new product offerings and when overall demand increases. Our success depends upon our ability to deliver both our current product offerings and new products and technologies on time and at an acceptable cost to our customers. The markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, substantial capital investment, changes in customer requirements and a constantly evolving industry. Our future performance will depend on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address these issues and provide solutions that meet our customers’ current and future needs. As a technology company, we also constantly encounter quality, volume and cost concerns such as: • Our continuing cost reduction programs which include site and organization consolidations, asset divestitures, outsourcing the manufacture of certain products to contract manufacturers, other outsourcing initiatives, and reductions in employee headcount, requirements related to re-establishment and re-qualification by our customers of complex manufacturing lines, and modifications to systems, planning and operational infrastructure. During this process, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, additional costs, delays in re-establishing volume production levels, planning difficulties, inventory issues, factory absorption concerns and systems integration problems. • We have experienced variability of manufacturing yields caused by difficulties in the manufacturing process, the effects from a shift in product mix, changes in product specifications and the introduction of new product lines. These difficulties can reduce yields or disrupt production and thereby increase our manufacturing costs and adversely affect our margin. • We may incur significant costs to correct defective products (despite rigorous testing for quality both by our customers and by us), which could include lost future sales of the affected product and other products, and potentially severe customer relations problems, litigation and damage to our reputation.
• We are dependent on a limited number of vendors, who are often small and specialized, for raw materials, packages and standard components. We also rely on contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture certain products. Our business could continue to be adversely affected by this dependency. Specific concerns we periodically encounter with our suppliers include stoppages or delays of supply, insufficient vendor resources to supply our requirements, substitution of more expensive or less reliable products, receipt of defective parts or contaminated materials, increases in the price of supplies and an inability to obtain reduced pricing from our suppliers in response to competitive pressures. Additionally, the ability of our contract manufacturers to fulfill their obligations may be affected by economic, political or other forces that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such failure could have a material impact on our ability to meet customers’ expectations and may materially impact our operating results.
• New product programs and introductions involve changing product specifications and customer requirements, unanticipated engineering complexities, difficulties in reallocating resources and overcoming resource limitations and increased complexity, which expose us to yield and product risk internally and with our suppliers. 52 Table of Contents These factors have caused considerable strain on our execution capabilities and customer relations. We have and could continue to see periodic difficulty responding to customer delivery expectations for some of our products, and yield and quality problems, particularly with some of our new products and higher volume products which could require additional funds and other resources required to respond to these execution challenges. From time to time, we have had to divert resources from new product R&D and other functions to assist with resolving these matters. If we do not improve our performance in all of these areas, our operating results will be harmed, the commercial viability of new products may be challenged, and our customers may choose to reduce or terminate their purchases of our products and purchase additional products from our competitors. Unfavorable, uncertain or unexpected conditions in the transition to new technologies may cause our growth forecasts to be inaccurate and/or cause fluctuations in our financial results.
Growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may not prove to be accurate.
Our estimates of the market opportunities related to 5G infrastructure, 3D sensing and other developing technologies are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, including our internal analysis, industry experience and third-party data.
Accordingly, these markets may not develop in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate and our estimated market opportunities may prove to be materially inaccurate. If domestic and global economic conditions worsen, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, pricing and inflationary pressures, overall spending on 5G infrastructure, 3D sensing and other developing technologies may be reduced, which would adversely impact demand for our products in these markets. In addition, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to such technologies may limit or slow the rate of global adoption, impede our strategy, and negatively impact our long-term expectations in these markets.
Our growth and ability to serve a significant portion of these markets is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy and market adoption and expansion of 5G infrastructure, 3D sensing and other applications for consumer electronics. We cannot assure you that we will be able to serve a significant portion of these markets and the growth forecasts should not be taken as indicative of our future growth. Even if the markets and rates of adoption develop in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate, if we do not have timely, competitively priced, market-accepted products available to meet our customers’ planned roll-out of 5G platforms and systems, 3D sensing products and other technologies, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may experience increased pressure on our pricing and contract terms due to our reliance on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales. We believe that we will continue to rely upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Any failure by us to continue capturing a significant share of key customer sales could materially harm our business. Dependence on a limited number of customers exposes us to the risk that order reductions from any one customer can have a material adverse effect on periodic revenue. Further, to the extent that there is consolidation among communications equipment manufacturers and service providers, we will have increased dependence on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms. Customer consolidation activity and periodic manufacturing and inventory initiatives could also create the potential for disruptions in demand for our products as a consequence of such customers streamlining, reducing or delaying purchasing decisions.
We have a strategic alliance with SICPA to market and sell our OVP and OVMP product lines for banknote anti-counterfeiting applications worldwide. A material reduction in sales, or loss of the relationship with SICPA, may harm our business and operating results as we may be unable to find a substitute marketing and sales partner or develop these capabilities ourselves in a timely manner.
53 Table of Contents Movement towards virtualized networks and software solutions may result in lower demand for our hardware products and increased competition. The markets for our NE and SE segments are increasingly looking towards virtualized networks and software solutions. While we are devoting substantial resources to meet these needs, this trend may result in lower demand for our legacy hardware products. Additionally, barriers to entry are generally lower for software solutions, which may lead to increased competition for our products and services. We face a number of risks related to our strategic transactions. Our strategy continues to include periodic acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and technologies. Strategic transactions of this nature involve numerous risks, including the following: • Diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;
• Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process R&D;
• Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions;
• Difficulties in obtaining or providing sufficient transition services and accurately projecting the time and cost associated with providing these services;
• An acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments;
• Expected earn-outs may not be achieved in the time frame or at the level expected or at all; • We may not be able to recognize or capitalize on expected growth, synergies or cost savings; • Insufficient net revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;
• Potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;
• Difficulty in forecasting revenues and margins; • The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any other adverse public health developments, epidemic disease or other pandemic in the countries in which we operate or our customers are located, including regional quarantines restricting the movement of people or goods, reductions in labor supply or staffing, the closure of facilities to protect employees, including those of our customers, disruptions to global supply chains and both our and our suppliers’ ability to deliver materials and products on a timely or cost-effective basis, shipment, acceptance or verification delays, the resulting overall significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and economic instability affecting customer spending patterns; and • Inadequate internal control procedures and disclosure controls to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or poor integration of a target company’s or business’s procedures and controls. Acquisitions may also cause us to: • Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership and may decrease earnings per share;
• Assume liabilities, some of which may be unknown at the time of the acquisitions;
54 Table of Contents • Record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;
• Incur additional debt to finance such acquisitions;
• Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; or • Acquire, assume, or become subject to litigation related to the acquired businesses or assets. We may not generate positive returns on our research and development strategy. Developing our products is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. We expect to continue to invest heavily in R&D in order to expand the capabilities of 3D sensing and smart phone sensors, handheld spectrometer solution and portable test instruments, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology. We expect that our results of operations may be impacted by the timing and size of these investments. In addition, these investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.
Operational Risks Restructuring We have from time to time engaged in restructuring activities to realign our cost base with current and anticipated future market conditions, including one recently announced for fiscal 2023. Significant risks associated with these types of actions that may impair our ability to achieve the anticipated cost reductions or disrupt our business include delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the U.S. and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of key employees. In addition, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We face risks related to our international operations and revenue. Our customers are located throughout the world. In addition, we have significant operations outside North America, including product development, manufacturing, sales and customer support operations. Our international presence exposes us to certain risks, including the following: • Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and among the currencies of the countries in which we do business may adversely affect our operating results
by negatively impacting our revenues or increasing our expenses; • Our ability to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business, including, among other things, customs, import/export, anti-bribery, anti-competition, tax and data privacy laws, which may be subject to sudden and unexpected changes;
• Difficulties in establishing and enforcing our intellectual property rights;
• Tariffs and other trade barriers;
• Political, legal and economic instability in foreign markets, particularly in those markets in which we maintain manufacturing and product development facilities;
• Strained or worsening relations between the United States, Russia and China and related impacts on other countries; 55 Table of Contents • Difficulties in staffing and management; • Language and cultural barriers;
• Seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located;
• Integration of foreign operations;
• Longer payment cycles;
• Difficulties in management of foreign distributors; and
• Potential adverse tax consequences. The spread of COVID-19 has affected the manufacturing and shipment of goods globally. Any delay in production or delivery of our products due to an extended closure of our suppliers’ plants could adversely impact our business, along with delays in shipment of our products as well as increased logistics costs. We expect that net revenue from customers outside North America will continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue. Lower sales levels that typically occur during the summer months in Europe and some other overseas markets may materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, the revenues we derive from many of our customers depend on international sales and further expose us to the risks associated with such international sales. Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks Certain of our products are subject to governmental and industry regulations, certifications and approvals. The commercialization of certain of the products we design, manufacture and distribute through our OSP segment may be more costly due to required government approval and industry acceptance processes. Development of applications for our anti-counterfeiting and special effects pigments may require significant testing that could delay our sales. For example, durability testing by the automobile industry of our special effects pigments used with automotive paints can take up to three years. If we change a product for any reason, including technological changes or changes in the manufacturing process, prior approvals or certifications may be invalid and we may need to go through the approval process again. If we are unable to obtain these or other government or industry certifications in a timely manner, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected.
U.S. Government trade actions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, and results of operation. The United States and China have been engaged in protracted negotiations over the Chinese government’s acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. For example, the United States has increased tariffs on certain categories of high-tech and consumer goods imported from China pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, including a current 25% tariff on List 1, List 2 and List 3 goods, which lists cover certain materials and/or products that we import from China.
On May 16, 2019, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and 68 designated non-U.S. affiliates (collectively, Huawei) were added to the Entity List of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), which imposes limitations on the supply of certain U.S. items and product support to Huawei. On August 17, 2020, BIS issued final rules that further restrict access by Huawei to items produced domestically and abroad from U.S. technology and software. Products that VIAVI sells to Huawei have been affected by the restrictions, however the impact is not expected to be material to our overall operations. 56 Table of Contents These measures, along with any additional tariffs or other trade actions that may be implemented, may increase the cost of certain materials and/or products that we import from China, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. These actions could require us to raise our prices, which could decrease demand for our products. As a result, these actions, including potential retaliatory measures by China and further escalation into a potential “trade war”, may adversely impact our business. While recent US export controls on China’s semiconductor and artificial intelligence industries may have an indirect impact on VIAVI, the implications of such controls are still being evaluated and are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated annual revenues. Furthermore, the geopolitical and economic uncertainty and/or instability that may result from changes in the relationship among the United States, Taiwan and China, may, directly or indirectly, materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, certain of our suppliers are dependent on products sourced from Taiwan which has been distinguished in its prevalence in certain global markets, most specifically semiconductor manufacturing. Hence, greater restrictions and/or disruptions of our suppliers’ ability to operate facilities and/or do business in these jurisdictions may increase the cost of certain materials and/or limit the supply of products and may result in deterioration of our profit margins, a potential need to increase our pricing and, in so doing, may decrease demand for our products and thereby adversely impact our revenue or profitability.
Due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S., E.U. and U.K. have broadened restrictions on exports to Russia, thereby blocking shipments of technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics products to Russia. This caused us to suspend transactions in the region effective February 2022 and has negatively impacted our business in the region. Sales in the region are not material to our total consolidated revenues or net income and we are not aware of any specific event or circumstances that would require an update to the estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities at this time. However, these estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates assumptions or conditions due to risks and uncertainties, including the ongoing situation in Ukraine as well as the potential for additional trade actions or retaliatory cyber-attacks aimed at infrastructure or supply chains, and the impact on our future operations and results in the region remains uncertain. Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may harm our business.
Complex local, state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These privacy laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, California enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and allow such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal data. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, there are five new state privacy laws that will go into effect in 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, expanding the CCPA to provide for certain obligations with respect to California employee’s sensitive personal data and an expansion of rights, including the right to limit, correct and request deletion of certain sensitive personal data, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, the Colorado Privacy Act and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, and a number of other states are considering similar laws. In addition, a federal privacy bill, called the American Data Privacy and Protection Act was recently published. The new state privacy laws and proposed federal law will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. The new and proposed privacy laws may result in further uncertainty and would require us to incur additional expenditures to comply. These regulations and legislative developments have potentially far-reaching consequences and may require us to modify our data management practices and incur substantial compliance expense.
57 Table of Contents Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business.
Certain provisions in our charter and under Delaware laws could hinder a takeover attempt. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibiting, under some circumstances, publicly-held Delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations with some stockholders for a specified period of time without the approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting stock. Such provisions could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, even if such events could be beneficial, in the short-term, to the interests of the stockholders. In addition, such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions providing for the limitations of liability and indemnification of our directors and officers, allowing vacancies on our Board of Directors to be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, granting our Board of Directors the authority to establish additional series of preferred stock and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares (commonly known as “blank check preferred”) and providing that our stockholders can take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders, which may only be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors. These provisions may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or change in our management. Information Security, Technology and Intellectual Property Risks Our business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. In some cases, we rely upon third-party hosting and support services to meet these needs. The internet has experienced an increase in cyber threats in the form of phishing emails, malware attachments and malicious websites. The growing and evolving cyber-risk environment means that individuals, companies, and organizations of all sizes, including ourselves and our hosting and support partners, are increasingly vulnerable to attacks and disruptions on their networks and systems by a wide range of actors on an ongoing and regular basis.
58 Table of Contents We maintain information security tools and technologies, staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our networks and information systems, and conduct employee training on cyber-security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber-security threats. Our network security controls are comprised of administrative, physical and technical controls, which include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, anti-virus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, off-site storage, network audits and other routine updates and modifications.
We also routinely monitor and develop our internal information technology systems to address risks to our information systems. Despite our implementation of these and other security measures and those of our third-party vendors, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other similar disruptions and attacks that continue to emerge and evolve. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our business processes, network degradation, and system down time, along with the potential that a third-party will gain unauthorized access to, or acquire intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to our employees, customers, suppliers, and business partners, including personal data. To the extent that any disruption, degradation, downtime or other security event results in a loss or damage to our data or systems, or in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or personal information, it could adversely impact us and our clients, potentially resulting in, among other things, financial losses, loss of customers or business, our inability to transact business on behalf of our clients, adverse impact on our brand and reputation, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, litigation, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs. We may also incur additional costs related to cyber-security risk management and remediation. There can be no assurance that we or our service providers, if applicable, will not suffer losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all the costs resulting from such events. No assurances can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful.
If we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those we have, our business would be materially harmed.
We seek to protect our products and our product roadmaps in part by developing and/or securing proprietary rights relating to those products, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. The steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or products. Other companies may be investigating or developing other technologies that are similar to our own. It is possible that patents may not be issued from any of our pending applications or those we may file in the future and, if patents are issued, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to deter or prohibit others from making, using or selling products that are similar to ours. We do not own patents in every country in which we sell or distribute our products, and thus others may be able to offer identical products in countries where we do not have intellectual property protection. In addition, the laws of some territories in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including Europe, Asia-Pacific or Latin America, may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
Any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Additionally, we are currently a licensee in all of our operating segments for a number of third-party technologies, software and intellectual property rights from academic institutions, our competitors and others, and are required to pay royalties to these licensors for the use thereof. Unless we are able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, patents or other intellectual property held by others could inhibit our development of new products, impede the sale of some of our current products, substantially increase the cost to provide these products to our customers, and could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. In the past, licenses generally have been available to us where third-party technology was necessary or useful for the development or production of our products. In the future licenses to third-party technology may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
59 Table of Contents Our products may be subject to claims that they infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Lawsuits and allegations of patent infringement and violation of other intellectual property rights occur in our industry on a regular basis. We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, notices from third parties claiming that our products infringe their proprietary rights. Over the past several years there has been a marked increase in the number and potential severity of third-party patent infringement claims, primarily from two distinct sources. First, large technology companies, including some of our customers and competitors, are seeking to monetize their patent portfolios and have developed large internal organizations that have approached us with demands to enter into license agreements. Second, patent-holding companies, entities that do not make or sell products (often referred to as “patent trolls”), have claimed that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights. We will continue to respond to these claims in the course of our business operations. In the past, the resolution of these disputes has not had a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition; however, this may not be the case in the future. Further, the litigation or settlement of these matters, regardless of the merit of the claims, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not we are successful. If we are unsuccessful, we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation. We may not be successful in such development, or such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Without such a license, we could be enjoined from future sales of the infringing product or products, which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. The use of open-source software in our products, as well as those of our suppliers, manufacturers and customers, may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property position. Certain of the software and/or firmware that we use and distribute (as well as that of our suppliers, manufacturers and customers) may be, be derived from, or contain, “open source” software, which is software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Such open-source software is often made available under licenses which impose obligations in the event the software or derivative works thereof are distributed or re-distributed. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public, and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license customarily used to protect our own software products. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open-source software, in the event that a court rules that these licenses are unenforceable, or in the event the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work. Additionally, open-source licenses are subject to occasional revision. In the event future iterations of open-source software are made available under a revised license, such license revisions may adversely affect our ability to use such future iterations.
Environmental, Social and Governance Risks
We may be subject to environmental liabilities which could increase our expenses and harm our operating results. We are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the environment, including those governing pollution and protection of human health and the environment and, recently, those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and holding producers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate, are often complex and are subject to frequent changes. We will need to ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted, as well as all environmental laws and regulations, and as appropriate or required, that our component suppliers also comply with such laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with such laws, we could face sanctions for such noncompliance, and our customers may refuse to purchase our products, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
60 Table of Contents With respect to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in general, we have incurred, and in the future could incur, substantial costs for the cleanup of contaminated properties, either those we own or operate or to which we have sent wastes in the past, or to comply with such environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, we could be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics as a result of such clean-up or compliance obligations. If we were found to be in violation of these laws, we could be subject to governmental fines and liability for damages resulting from such violations. If we have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws, or if we are subject to significant expenditures in connection with a violation of these laws, our financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely impacted.
Our disclosures, initiatives and goals related to ESG matters expose us to numerous risks. There is an increasing focus from U.S. and foreign government agencies, certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. We may communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG matters, in our ESG Report, on our website, in our SEC filings, and elsewhere. These initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure of our ESG initiatives. Further, statements about our ESG initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. It is anticipated that the SEC will finalize rules in 2023 related to climate disclosures, human capital management and cybersecurity disclosures. Compliance with these complex regulations could be costly, burdensome and will require significant internal and external resources to achieve. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected and we could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny. We may be subject to risks related to climate change, natural disasters and catastrophic events. We operate in geographic regions which face a number of climate and environmental challenges. Our new corporate headquarters are located in Chandler, Arizona, a desert climate, subject to extreme heat and drought. The geographic location of our Northern California offices and production facilities subject them to drought, earthquake and wildfire risks. It is impossible to predict the timing, magnitude or location of such natural disasters or their impacts on the local economy and on our operations. If a major earthquake, wildfire or other natural disaster were to damage or destroy our facilities or manufacturing equipment, we may experience potential impacts ranging from production and shipping delays to lost profits and revenues. In October 2017 and again in October 2019, we temporarily closed our Santa Rosa, California facility resulting in production stoppage, due to wildfires in the region and the facility’s close proximity to the wildfire evacuation zone. The location of our production facility could subject us to production delays and/or equipment and property damage. Moreover, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), the public electric utility in our Northern California region, has previously implemented and may continue to implement widespread blackouts during the peak wildfire season to avoid and contain wildfires sparked during strong wind events by downed power lines or equipment failure. While we have not experienced damage to our facilities or a material disruption to operations as a result of these power outages, ongoing blackouts, particularly if prolonged or frequent, could impact our operations going forward. Management transitions and talent retention create uncertainties and could harm our business. Management changes could adversely impact our results of operations and our customer relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. Our executives and other key personnel are at-will employees and we generally do not have employment or non-compete agreements with our other employees, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them. We have recently and could continue to experience changes in our leadership team. Competition for people with the specific technical and other skills we require is significant. Moreover, we may face new and unanticipated difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees in connection with the change of our headquarters to Chandler, Arizona. As remote work has become more available the competition for highly qualified talent has intensified. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified executives and employees, or to successfully integrate any newly hired personnel within our organization, we may be unable to achieve our operating objectives, which could negatively impact our financial performance and results of operations.
61 Table of Contents Risks Related to our Liquidity and Indebtedness Any deterioration or disruption of the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding. Global economic conditions have caused and may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. When the capital or credit markets deteriorate or are disrupted, our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund a portion of our working capital needs and other general corporate purposes, or to refinance maturing obligations as they become due, may be constrained. In the event that we were to seek to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time, if at all. We may seek to access the capital or credit markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. For example, in December 2021, we entered into a $300 million asset-based secured credit facility which has certain limitations based on our borrowing capacity. Our access to the financial markets and the pricing and terms we receive in the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including changes in financial markets and interest rates. In addition, if we do access the capital or credit markets, agreements governing any borrowing arrangement could contain covenants restricting our operations. Our notes increased our overall leverage and our convertible notes could dilute our existing stockholders and lower our reported earnings per share.
The issuance of our 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024, our 1.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, and our 3.75% Senior Notes due 2029 (together the “Notes”) substantially increased our principal payment obligations. The degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully obtain financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures. In addition, the holders of the 2023 and 2024 Notes are entitled to convert the Notes into shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock under certain circumstances which would dilute our existing stockholders and lower our reported per share earnings.
Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.
Our outstanding indebtedness may limit our operational and financial flexibility.
Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:
• Impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;
• Requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations;
• Limiting our ability to grow and make capital expenditures due to the financial covenants contained in our debt arrangements;
• Impairing our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, invest in new or developing technologies, or take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise; • Making us more vulnerable if a general economic downturn occurs or if our business experiences difficulties; and
62 Table of Contents • Resulting in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under the Notes or our other debt or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing the Notes, or any other debt instruments, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt. We may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.
We may not successfully implement our business strategy, and even if we do, we may not realize the anticipated results of our strategy and generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and working capital needs. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, including the notes, is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control.
In the event our cash flow is inadequate to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required, to the extent permitted under the indentures covering the Notes and any other debt agreements, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Any insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
Despite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt.
We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indentures that govern the Notes and the agreement that governs our secured credit facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the agreements governing our existing debt. The terms of the indentures that govern the Notes and the agreement that governs our secured credit facility restrict our current and future operations.
The indentures governing the Notes and the agreement governing the secured credit facility contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:
• Incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;
• Incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness;
• Make investments;
• Consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;
• Sell assets;
• Pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock;
• Enter into transactions with affiliates;
• Amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness;
• Enter into certain restrictive agreements;
• Engage in a new line of business;
• Amend certain material agreements, including material leases and debt agreements; and
63 Table of Contents • Enter into sale leaseback transactions.
Tax Risks Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations and/or changes in regulations. Changes in U.S. federal income or other tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, as recently passed by Congress, may impact our tax liabilities. Utilization of our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation if the ownership change limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions are triggered by changes in the ownership of our capital stock. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Accordingly, purchases of our capital stock by others could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards in the future.
Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards before they expire. Due to uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of our future profitability, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset our U.S. and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets because of uncertainty related to our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards before they expire.
If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards.
