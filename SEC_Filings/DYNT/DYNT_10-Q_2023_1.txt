December 31, 2022   Note 1. Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Business   Dynatronics Corporation (“Company,” “Dynatronics”) is a leading medical device company committed to providing high-quality restorative products designed to accelerate achieving optimal health. The Company designs, manufactures, and sells a broad range of products for clinical use in physical therapy, rehabilitation, orthopedics, pain management, and athletic training. Through its distribution channels, Dynatronics markets and sells to orthopedists, physical therapists, chiropractors, athletic trainers, sports medicine practitioners, clinics, and hospitals.   Reverse Stock Split   On November 17, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved Articles of Amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of Amendment”) to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-5, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion. Thereafter, the Company’s Board of Directors set the split ratio in the reverse stock split at 1-for-5 and approved and authorized the filing of the Articles of Amendment to effect the reverse stock split with the Utah Department of Commerce, Division of Corporations and Commercial Code. The Articles of Amendment and reverse stock split became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 1, 2023. At the effective time, every five issued and outstanding shares of common stock were converted into one share of common stock, with any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split rounded up to the nearest whole share. The reverse stock split did not affect the Company’s authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock, which remained at
100,000,000
and
50,000,000
shares, respectively. The par value of each share of common stock remained unchanged. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options, restricted stock and warrants outstanding at February 1, 2023, which resulted in a proportional decrease in the number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants. Additionally, the reverse stock split had no impact on the number of shares of the Company’s preferred stock issued and outstanding. However, the conversion price of the outstanding preferred stock increased and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of such preferred stock decreased in proportion to the 1-for-5 split ratio.
Unless noted, all common shares and per share amounts contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a one-for-five reverse stock split.
Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (the “Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”) have been prepared by the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. As such, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (the “Annual Report”) filed with the SEC on September 22, 2022. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2022, has been derived from the Annual Report.   The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report. In the opinion of management, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2022 and its results of operations and its cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the first six months of the fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year or any future periods.   The Company’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 and references made to “fiscal year 2023” and “fiscal year 2022” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, respectively.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented.   The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjusts those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions.   Employee Retention Credit   The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) provided an employee retention credit which was a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act extended and expanded the availability of the employee retention credit through June 30, 2021. Subsequently, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 extended the availability of the employee retention credit through December 31, 2021.
This new legislation amended the employee retention credit to be equal to 70 of qualified wages paid to employees after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2022. During calendar year 2021, a maximum of $10,000 in qualified wages for each employee per qualifying calendar quarter may be counted in determining the 70% credit . Therefore, the maximum tax credit that can be claimed by an eligible employer is $ 7,000
per employee per qualifying calendar quarter of 2021. The Company qualifies for the employee retention credit for quarters that experience a significant decline in gross receipts, defined as quarterly gross receipts that are less than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act retroactively ended the employee retention credit as of September 30, 2021. The Company qualified for the credit beginning on January 1, 2021 and received credits for qualified wages through September 30, 2021. During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded an employee retention credit totaling $ 1,143,000 , of which, $ 97,000 , $ 103,000 , and $ 943,000
was recorded within cost of sales, selling, general, and administrative, and other income, respectively, on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.
7 Table of Contents   Other Receivables   Other receivables consist of amounts due from our contract manufacturer for raw materials components provided for use in the production of our products. Payments are due from our contract manufacturer based on the usage of raw material components.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt— Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which is intended to simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The guidance allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.   Note 2. Net Loss per Common Share   Net loss per common share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and, when appropriate, dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Stock options, convertible preferred stock and warrants are considered to be potential common stock. The computation of diluted net loss per common share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect.   Basic net loss per common share is the amount of net loss for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net loss per common share is the amount of net loss for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share of potential common stock outstanding during the period, unless inclusion of potential common stock would have an anti-dilutive effect.   All outstanding options, warrants and convertible preferred stock for common shares are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share because they are anti-dilutive, which for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, totaled  1,555,615  and  1,559,900 , respectively, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, totaled  1,562,900  and  1,551,400 , respectively.   Note 3. Convertible Preferred Stock   As of December 31, 2022, the Company had issued and outstanding a total of
1,992,000
shares of Series A 8% Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) and
1,359,000
shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred"). The Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred are convertible into a total of
3,351,000
shares of common stock. Dividends payable on these preferred shares accrue at the rate of
8 % per year and are payable quarterly in stock or cash at the option of the Company. The Company generally pays the dividends on the preferred stock by issuing shares of its common stock. The formula for paying these dividends using common stock in lieu of cash can change the effective yield on the dividend to more or less than 8% depending on the market price of the common stock at the time of issuance.   In January 2023, the Company paid $ 173,128
of preferred stock dividends with respect to the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred that accrued during the three months ended December 31, 2022, by issuing
68,838
shares of common stock.     8 Table of Contents   Note 4. Inventories   Inventories consisted of the following:

In the following MD&A, we have rounded many numbers to the nearest one thousand dollars. These numbers should be read as approximate. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Our fiscal year ends on June 30. For example, reference to fiscal year 2023 refers to the year ending June 30, 2023. This report covers the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.

Net sales increased $105,000, or 0.5%, to $22,936,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net sales of $22,831,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to an increase in customer demand compared to the prior year period in which we experienced the impact of COVID-19 precautions and associated deferral on elective procedures which reduced demand for our products.     11 Table of Contents   Gross Profit   Gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 increased $981,000, or about 47.1%, to $3,062,000, or 28.1% of net sales. By comparison, gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 was $2,081,000, or 19.8% of net sales. Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $960,000, or about 16.7%, to $6,705,000, or 29.2% of net sales. By comparison, gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was $5,745,000, or 25.2% of net sales. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by net price realization and overall product mix. The year-over-year increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to a reduction in freight-in expenses, stabilized raw material costs, and changes in product mix.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $380,000, or 10.9%, to $3,862,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to $3,482,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Selling expenses increased $459,000 compared to the prior year period, due primarily to higher marketing program expenses and higher salaries. The increase in selling expenses was offset by a decrease in general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses of $79,000 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in G&A was driven primarily by a reduction in professional services and salaries.
SG&A expenses increased $402,000, or 5.3%, to $7,980,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $7,578,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Selling expenses increased $669,000 compared to the prior year period, due primarily to higher marketing program expenses and higher salaries. The increase in selling expenses was offset by a decrease in G&A expenses of $267,000 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in G&A was driven primarily by a reduction in professional services and salaries.
Net Other Income (Expense)   Net other expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, was $37,000 compared to net other expense of $40,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net other expense is primarily due to a $2,000 decrease in interest expense as a result of lower average borrowings on long-term debt. Net other expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022, was $68,000 compared to net other income of $875,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net other expense is primarily due to a $943,000 employee retention credit for funds received or receivable from the U.S. federal government under the CARES Act in the prior year.
12 Table of Contents   Income Tax Provision   Income tax provision was $4,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and $0 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Deferred Income Tax Assets  below for more information.    Net Loss   Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $841,000 compared to a net loss of $1,441,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The $600,000 decrease in net loss was attributable to an increase of $981,000 in gross profit, a decrease of $3,000 in other expense, and offset by an increase of $380,000 in SG&A. Net loss was $1,347,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of $959,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The $388,000 increase in net loss was attributable to an increase of $954,000 in other expense, increase of $401,000 in SG&A, and offset by an increase of $960,000 in gross profit.
Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders   Net loss attributable to common stockholders decreased $609,000 to $1,014,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,623,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter is due primarily to a $600,000 decrease in net loss. On a per share basis, basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders was $0.27 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to $0.46 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
Net loss attributable to common stockholders increased $362,000 to $1,690,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,328,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. On a per share basis, basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders was $0.45 per share for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $0.38 per share for the six months ended December 31, 2021.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   We have historically financed operations through cash from operating activities, available cash reserves, and proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. As of December 31, 2022, we had $685,000 in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, compared to $701,000 as of June 30, 2022.   Working capital was $8,287,000 as of December 31, 2022, compared to working capital of $9,291,000 as of June 30, 2022. The current ratio was 1.9 to 1 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. Current assets were 50.3% of total assets as of December 31, 2022, and 54.3% of total assets as of June 30, 2022.   We believe that our cash generated from operations, current capital resources, and equity proceeds provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the next 12 months. However, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global supply chain, higher personnel costs, and changes to product mix, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and cash and we continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can continue to operate during these uncertain times.   In March 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Canaccord Genuity LLC and Roth Capital Partners LLC, pursuant to which we arranged to offer and sell shares of our common stock in an at-the-market offering (“ATM”) under a registration statement previously filed by us on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On March 13, 2020, we filed a Prospectus Supplement amending the registration statement (as amended, the "Original Registration Statement") and commenced the ATM. Under the terms of the equity distribution agreement, we may sell shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $10,000,000, with Canaccord Genuity LLC and Roth Capital Partners LLC acting as our sales agents at the market prices prevailing on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the time of the sale of such shares. We will pay Canaccord Genuity LLC and Roth Capital Partners, LLC a fixed commission rate equal to 3.0% of the gross sale price per share of common stock sold.
In May 2021, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 together with a Prospectus Supplement, for the purpose of replacing the Original Registration Statement, which expired after three years, pursuant to applicable SEC rules. The replacement registration statement provides for potential futures sales in conjunction with a prospectus supplement for up to $2,677,997 in common stock in the ATM.   Reverse Stock Split   On November 17, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved Articles of Amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of Amendment”) to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-5, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion. Thereafter, the Company’s Board of Directors set the split ratio in the reverse stock split at 1-for-5 and approved and authorized the filing of the Articles of Amendment to effect the reverse stock split with the Utah Department of Commerce, Division of Corporations and Commercial Code. The Articles of Amendment and reverse stock split became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 1, 2023. At the effective time, every five issued and outstanding shares of common stock were converted into one share of common stock, with any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split rounded up to the nearest whole share. The reverse stock split did not affect the Company’s authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock, which remained at 100,000,000 and 50,000,000 shares, respectively. The par value of each share of common stock remained unchanged. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options, restricted stock and warrants outstanding at February 1, 2023, which resulted in a proportional decrease in the number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants. Additionally, the reverse stock split had no impact on the number of shares of the Company’s preferred stock issued and outstanding. However, the conversion price of the outstanding preferred stock increased and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of such preferred stock decreased in proportion to the 1-for-5 split ratio.
Unless noted, all common shares and per share amounts contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a one-for-five reverse stock split.
13 Table of Contents   Cash and Cash Equivalents   Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash position decreased $16,000 to $685,000 as of December 31, 2022, compared to $701,000 as of June 30, 2022. The primary use of cash for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was to pay down existing vendor payables.   Accounts Receivable   Trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, decreased approximately $185,000, or 3.4%, to $5,231,000 as of December 31, 2022, from $5,416,000 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by differences in the timing of collections around the end date of each respective quarter. Trade accounts receivable represents amounts due from our customers including dealers and distributors that purchase our products for redistribution, medical practitioners, clinics, hospitals, colleges, universities, and sports teams. We believe that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on our historical experience and relationships with our customers. Accounts receivable are generally collected within approximately 40 days of invoicing.   Inventories   Inventories, net of reserves, decreased $1,325,000 or 11.0%, to $10,746,000 as of December 31, 2022, compared to $12,071,000 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to steps taken to adjust inventory management in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the global supply chain and right-size incoming material purchases to demand. We believe that our allowance for inventory obsolescence is adequate based on our analysis of inventory, sales trends, and historical experience.   Accounts Payable   Accounts payable decreased approximately $123,000 or 2.0%, to $6,046,000 as of December 31, 2022, from $6,169,000 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in inventory purchases and timing of payments.   Debt   Long-term debt decreased $5,118 to $244 as of December 31, 2022, compared to $5,362 as of June 30, 2022. Our long-term debt is primarily comprised of loans related to equipment.   Finance Lease Liability   Finance lease liability as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 totaled approximately $2,170,000 and $2,260,000, respectively. Our finance lease liability consists primarily of our Utah building lease. In conjunction with the sale and leaseback of our Utah building in August 2014, we entered into a 15-year lease, classified as a finance lease, originally valued at $3,800,000. The building lease asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years at approximately $252,000 per year. Total accumulated amortization related to the leased building is approximately $2,120,000 at December 31, 2022. The sale generated a profit of $2,300,000, which is being recognized straight-line over the life of the lease at approximately $150,000 per year as an offset to amortization expense. The balance of the deferred gain as of December 31, 2022, is $1,003,000. Lease payments, currently approximately $32,000, are payable monthly and increase annually by approximately 2% per year over the life of the lease. Imputed interest for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $30,000 and 60,000, respectively. In addition to the Utah building, we have certain equipment leases that we have determined are finance leases.     14 Table of Contents   Operating Lease Liability   Operating lease liability as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 totaled approximately $3,256,000 and $1,574,000, respectively. Our operating lease liability consists primarily of building leases for office, manufacturing, and warehouse space. The increase was primarily due to the Company’s decision to exercise its third option and extend its operating lease for an additional five years in New Jersey.   Deferred Income Tax Assets   A valuation allowance is required when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of deferred income tax assets. The ability to realize deferred income tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each tax jurisdiction. We have determined that we do not meet the “more likely than not” threshold that deferred income tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is required. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will favorably impact our results of operations in the period of reversal. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. This resulted in no reported income tax expense associated with the operating profit reported during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.   Stock Repurchase Plans   We have a stock repurchase plan available to us at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Approximately $449,000 remained of this authorization as of December 31, 2022. No purchases have been made under this plan since September 2011.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   As of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.   Critical Accounting Policies   The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that report.     15 Table of Contents   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   There have been no material changes from the information presented for the year ended June 30, 2022.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures.   Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level, to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     16 Table of Contents   PART II.
