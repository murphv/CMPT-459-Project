ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Coda
Octopus Group, Inc. (“Coda,”
“the Company,” or “we”) operates two distinct operating business units. These are the Marine Technology Business
(also referred to in this Form 10-Q as “Products Business,” or “Products Segment”) and the Marine Engineering
Business (also referred to in this Form 10-Q as “Services Business”, “Engineering Business” or “Services
Segment”). The Marine Technology Business sells technology solutions to the subsea and underwater markets. These solutions are designed,
developed, manufactured and supported by the Company. Its main revenue generating product is the Echoscope ®
and Echoscope
PIPE ®
(Parallel Intelligent Processing Engine). In 2021, the Products Business launched a new diver management system (Diver
Augmented Vision Display ( “ DAVD ” )) for use in the global defense and commercial diving markets and which
is a significant part
of our growth
plans for the Company.
The requirements for the DAVD system emanated from the Office of Naval Research as part of its Future Naval Requirements
Program. The DAVD embeds inside of the diver Head up Display (HUD) a pair of transparent glasses which is used as the data hub for displaying
real time data to the diver. The concept of using a pair of transparent glasses in the Head up Display (HUD) underwater for this purpose
is protected by patent and licensed to the Company by the United States Department of the Navy at Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama
City Division. The Marine Engineering Business is an established sub-contractor to prime defense contractors and generally supplies proprietary
sub-assemblies for incorporation into broader mission critical defense systems. These sub - assemblies typically are supplied for the life
of the program. The Marine Engineering Business scope typically includes concept, design, prototype and manufacture. The manufacturing
contracts for these
sub- assemblies can run over many
years.
The
consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Coda Octopus Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements.
The preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues including unbilled and deferred revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates related to the percentage of completion method used to account
for contracts including costs and earnings in excess of billings, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and the valuation
of goodwill.
NOTE

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with
Customers
(“Topic 606”).
Topic
606 has established a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to record from contracts with customers. The five steps are:
●
Identify
the contract with the customer;
●
Identify
the performance obligations in the contract with customer;
●
Determine
the transaction price;
●
Allocate
the transaction price to performance obligations; and
●
Recognize
revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied.
Our
revenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers. These are derived from both sales and rental of underwater technologies
and equipment for real time 3D imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications by the Marine Technology Business and from engineering
services which the Company’s Services Business provide via sub-contracts primarily with prime defense contractors. Our contracts
do not include the possibility for additional contingent consideration so that our determination of the contract price does not involve
having to consider potential additional variable consideration. Our sales do not include a right of return by the customer.

NOTE
2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION (Continued)
Regarding
our Marine Technology Business (“Products Business”), all our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market
prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we also provide services (e.g., installation, training, post-sales
technical support, customization of our technology for bespoke application, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product
or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized
when those services have been performed and evidence of the provision of those services exist.
Revenue
derived from either our subscription package offerings or rental of our equipment is recognized when performance obligations are met,
in particular, on a daily basis during the subscription or rental period.
For
arrangements
with multiple performance obligations, we recognize product revenue by allocating the transaction revenue to each performance
obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis and recognize revenue when performance obligations are met including
when equipment is delivered, and for rental of equipment, when installation , training
and other services
prescribed by the contract
are
performed.
Our
contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These are recognized as revenue when the Company has
fulfilled its obligations under the respective contracts. Until such time, we recognize these prepayments as deferred revenue.
For
software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered distinct to the functionality of the software, we recognize
revenue upon delivery of the software by the provision of the activation codes to the software.
With
respect to revenues related to our Services Business, there are contracts in place that specify the fixed hourly rate and other
reimbursable costs to be billed based on material and direct labor hours incurred and revenue is recognized on these contracts based
on material and the direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion
method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total services
(materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as we consider expenditures for direct materials and labor
hours to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts.
On
a quarterly basis, we examine all our fixed-price contracts to determine if there are any losses to be recognized during the period.
Any such loss is recorded in the quarter in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated
costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in
adjustments to operating results.
Recoverability
of Deferred Costs
In
accordance with Topic 606, we defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of incremental direct costs
to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from
third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties. The pricing of these service contracts is intended to provide
for the recovery of these types of deferred costs over the life of the contract.

NOTE
2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION (Continued)
We
recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion
method, costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation.
For revenue recognized over time, costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition.
At each quarterly balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable.
Any
anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its
estimated total revenue.
Other
Revenue Disclosures
See
Notes 14 and 15 – Segment Analysis and
Disaggregation of Revenue. These
Notes provide disclosure of our revenue by segment (Products Business versus Services Business); revenues from external customers and
cost of those revenues; and split of revenue by geography including within and outside the USA .
NOTE 3 –
COST OF GOODS SOLD
Our Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials
and related direct costs. With respect to sales made through the Company’s sales agents distribution network, we include in our
costs of goods sold commissions paid to agents for the specific sales they make. Without using agents, we would not be eligible to participate
in the Request for Proposals (“RFP”) for these sales on which we incur commission costs. All other sales-related expenses,
including those related to unsuccessful bids, are included in selling, general and administrative costs. As a component of Cost of Goods
Sold, commission in the 3 months period ended January 31, 2023 was $ 505,376
compared to $ 138,372
for the 3 months period ended January
31, 2022.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The
Company’s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts
of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair values because of the short-term nature of these
instruments.

SEGMENT ANALYSIS
Based
on the fundamental difference in the types of offering, products and solutions versus services, we operate two distinct reportable
segments which are managed separately. Coda Octopus Products (“Marine Technology Business” or “Products
Business” or “Products Segment”) operations are comprised primarily of sale and/or rental of underwater technology
sonar solutions, products for underwater operations including hardware and software and support services and our diver management
system. Coda Octopus Martech and Coda Octopus Colmek (“Marine Engineering Business” or “Services Segment”)
provide engineering services primarily as sub-contractors to prime defense contractors.
Segment
operating income is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses identifiable with the business segment. Corporate includes general
corporate administrative costs (“Overhead”).
The
Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon segment operating income. The accounting policies of the reportable
segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies.
There
are inter-segment sales which have been eliminated in our financial statements but are disclosed in the tables below for information
purposes.
The
following tables summarize segment asset and operating balances by reportable segment for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively.
The
Company’s reportable business segments sell their goods and services in four geographic locations:
●
Americas
●
Europe
●
Australia/Asia
●
Middle East/Africa

2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking
Statements
The
information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward
looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believes,” “estimates,”
“could,” “possibly,” “probably,” anticipates,” “projects,” “expects,”
“may,” “will,” or “should” or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that
the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s
current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management’s expectations.
The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith and the audited financial
statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 30, 2023. This discussion
should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion
reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present
assessment of our management.
General
Overview
Throughout
these discussions “ Current Quarter ” means the Three-month period ended January 31, 2023 and “ Previous
Quarter ” means the Three-month period ended January 31, 2022.
The Company operates two distinct businesses. These are:
●
the
Marine Technology Business (also referred to in this Form 10-Q as “Products Business”, or “Products Segment”); and
●
the
Marine Engineering Business (also referred to in this Form 10-Q as “Engineering Business”, or “Services
Business” or “Services Segment”).
Our
Marine Technology Business is an established technology solution provider to the subsea and underwater imaging, surveying and diving
market. It has been operating as a supplier of solutions comprising both hardware and software products for over 25 years to this
market and it owns key proprietary technology including real time volumetric 3D imaging sonar technology and cutting-edge diving
technology, that are used in both the underwater defense and commercial markets. All design, development and manufacturing of our
technology and solutions are performed within the Company.
Our
imaging sonar technology products and solutions marketed under the name of Echoscope ®
and Echoscope PIPE ®
are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore wind energy industry (offshore renewables), offshore oil and gas,
forward looking obstacle avoidance, complex underwater mapping, salvage operations, dredging, bridge inspection, underwater hazard detection,
port security, mining, fisheries, commercial and defense diving, and marine sciences sectors.
Our
novel diving technology is distributed under the name “CodaOctopus ®
DAVD” (Diver Augmented Vision
Display) to the global defense and commercial diving markets and is new to the market.
The DAVD embeds inside of the diver Head up Display (HUD) a pair of transparent glasses which is used as the data hub for displaying real
time data to the diver. We believe that the DAVD system has the potential to radically transform how diving operations are performed globally
because it provides a fully integrated singular system for topside control and a fully connected HUD system for the diver allowing both
the topside and diver to share a range of critical information including depth (pressure and temperature), compass and head tracking,
real time dive timers and alerts, diver position and navigation, ultra-low light enhanced video system and enhanced digital voice communications.
Limitations of current diving operations are that the diver only shares analog voice communications with the topside and there is no real
time information including real time navigation, tracking and mapping of the dive area. The topside must also manage several independent
systems for video, communications, and positioning. The Company’s solution addresses these deficiencies. Importantly also, using
our sonar technology, diving can be performed in zero visibility conditions, a common problem which besets these operations.
20
Although
we generate most of our revenues from our real time 3D sonar which includes both proprietary hardware and software, we have a number
of other products which we supply to the marine offshore market such as our inertial navigation systems (F280 Series ® ) and our
geophysical hardware (DA4G) and software solutions (GeoSurvey and Survey Engine®, which include artificial intelligence based automatic
detection systems). Our customers include offshore service providers to major oil and gas companies, renewable energy companies, underwater
construction companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, prime defense contractors, navies, research
institutes and universities and diving companies.
The Services Business has operations in the USA
and UK. Its central business model is working with Prime Defense Contractors to design and manufacture sub-assemblies for utilization
into larger defense mission critical integrated systems (“MCIS”). An example of such MCIS is the US Close-In-Weapons Support
(CIWS) Program for the Phalanx radar-guided cannon used on combat ships. These proprietary sub-assemblies, once approved within the MCIS
program, afford the Services Business the status of preferred supplier. Such status permits it to supply these sub-assemblies and upgrades
in the event of obsolescence or advancement of technology for the life of the MCIS program. Clients include prime defense contractors
such as Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Thales Underwater and BAE Systems. The scope of services provided by the Services Business encompasses
concept, design, prototype and manufacturing.
Key
Pillars for our Growth Plans
Our
volumetric real time imaging sonar technology and our DAVD are our most promising products for the Company’s near-term growth.
Our
real time 3D/4D/5D/6D Imaging sonars are the only underwater imaging sonars which are capable of providing complex seabed mapping, real time inspection and monitoring and providing 3D/4D/5D/6D data of moving underwater objects irrespective of water conditions including
in zero visibility (which is a common and costly problem in underwater operations). Competing products such as the multibeam sonar can perform
mapping (but not complex mapping) without the ability to perform real time inspection and monitoring of moving objects underwater. We
also believe our Echoscope PIPE ®
is the only technology that can generate multiple real time 3D/4D/5D/6D acoustic images
using different acoustic parameters such as frequency, field of view, pulse length, and filters.
In
the industry in which we operate, we are widely considered the leading solution providers for underwater real time 3D visualization.
We
also believe that the DAVD system is poised to radically change the way diving operations are performed globally by providing a
fully integrated suite of sensor data shared in real time by the dive supervisor on the surface and the diver. Current diving is
done largely by voice command missions from the topside using disparate suite of systems for video data, communications and
positioning.
The
DAVD is now in early-stage adoption by different teams within the US Navy such as the underwater construction and salvage teams and has
been moved from R&D phase to operational phase. Operational phase means that this is now a standard item available for purchase and for which budget lines are established
within the various user commands within the Navy.
The
concept of utilizing a pair of transparent glasses in the Head Up Display
(HUD) underwater, is protected by patent. All component parts of the DAVD system are proprietary to the Company and include software (4G
USE ® ), Diver Processing Pack – telemetry system (DPP), Top Side Controller and real time 3D Sonar. The Company
benefits from the exclusive license from the United States Department of the Navy at Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division
to exploit the utility patent covering the concept of using the pair of transparent glasses as a data hub underwater. The DAVD is an “Approved
Navy Use” item.
Both
the Marine Technology Business and Engineering Business have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering
skill sets (hardware, firmware and software) encompassing capturing, computing, processing and displaying data in harsh environments.
Both businesses jointly bid for projects for which their common joint skills provide competitive advantage and make them eligible for
such projects.
Factors
Affecting our Business in the Current Quarter
Following
is a short description of some of the most critical and pressing factors that affect our business. For a more detailed discussion of
these and additional factors, refer to our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
21
Cumulative
Supply Chain Issues
We
continue to experience shortage of key electronic components in the market
and suppliers are still quoting lead times as long as 12 months out for routine components, including FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays).
The unavailability of components affects our business in a number of ways, including:
Ø
Our ability to progress ongoing projects including customer projects, particularly on the Engineering Segment.
Ø
Significant increase in prices because demand exceeds supply for these components.
Ø
Our ability to manufacture systems in our Products Business.
Ø
Our ability to fully utilize our Production staff, as critical parts are unavailable.
Ø
Our ability to perform outstanding contractual obligations in the Engineering Business.
Inflation
Inflation
measured as the Consumer Price Index is significant in the countries in which we operate. For the 12-month period preceding January 2023, this was:
Ø
Denmark
7.7% - source: Statistics Denmark,
Ø
UK
10.1% - source: Office of National Statistics; and
Ø
USA
6.4% - source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Inflation
affects our business in a number of areas including increasing our cost of operations and our bill of material costs for the
products we sell and therefore our overall financial results. See the MD&A section which concerns “Inflation and Foreign
Currency”.
Currency
Fluctuations
The Company has operations in the UK, USA, Denmark, Australia and India. Our
consolidated results include the Company’s foreign subsidiaries results which are translated into USD, our reporting currency. Revenue and expenses are translated using the weighted average exchange
rates in effect during the reporting period. In the Current
Quarter the USD has strengthened against major currencies including the British Pound, Euro, Danish Kroner and Indian Rupees (the functional
currencies of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries). A significant part of our consolidated results is transacted in British Pounds
and Danish Kroner and translated into USD for reporting purposes. In the Current Quarter, for the purposes of reporting revenues and expenses,
the value of the Pound and Euro (the Danish Kroner is pegged to the Euro) respectively fell 9.5% and 5.8%, against the USD, when compared
to the Previous Quarter. For the reporting of assets and liabilities, the Pound fell 8.3% when compared to the Previous Quarter and the
Danish Kroner fell 3.1% over the same period. The impact of currency fluctuations is discussed more fully below under “Inflation
and Foreign Currency”. See also Note 5 (Foreign Currency Translation) to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the
section of this report which concerns “Inflation and Foreign Currency”.
Skills/Resource
Shortages and Pressure on Salaries and Wages
We
are experiencing skill shortages in areas that are critical to our growth strategy including experienced sales and marketing personnel,
software developers and skilled electronic technicians. The inflationary conditions in the countries in which we operate (US, the UK,
Denmark and India) make it difficult for us to compete for these skills as there is extreme pressure on wages.
Concentration
of Business Opportunities Where the Sales Cycle is Long and Unpredictable
The Services Business revenues are highly concentrated
and are generated from sub-contracts with Prime Defense Contractors. The sales cycle is generally protracted and this may affect quarterly
revenues. It is also dependent on the federal government appropriating budget for defense projects and where the federal government is
unable to find consensus in the US Congress, this affects the timely award of sub-contract from Prime Defense Contractors to our Services
Business, which is reliant on these awards. Furthermore, the Products Business key opportunities which are critical to its growth strategy
are in the Defense Market for both its imaging sonars and the DAVD both of which are key pillars
of the Company’s growth strategy. Due to the protracted nature of the government procurement process and cycle for defense spending
under federal and/or state budgets, the sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, thus affecting timing of orders and thus quarterly
revenues.
Impact
on Revenues and Earnings
We
are uncertain as to the extent of the impact the factors disclosed above and in our Form 10-K covering fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 will have
on our future financial results.
22
Impact
on Liquidity, Balance Sheet and Assets
These
factors may adversely impact on our availability of free cash flow, working capital and business prospects. As of January 31, 2023, we
had cash and cash equivalents of $24,522,383 and in the Current Quarter we generated $984,886 of cash from
operations. Based on our outstanding obligations and our cash balances, we believe we have sufficient working capital to effectively
continue our business operations for the foreseeable future.
Critical
Accounting Policies
This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have
been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
Below
is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating
results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently
uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described
below, can be found in Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2022.
Revenue
Recognition
Our
revenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers and are derived from both sales and rental of underwater solutions for
imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services that we provide. Our contracts do not include the
possibility for additional contingent consideration so that our determination of the contract price does not involve having to consider
potential variable additional consideration. Our product sales do not include a right of return by the customer.
Regarding
our Products Business, all of our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products.
To the extent that we also provide services (e.g., installation, training, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product
or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized
when those services have been provided to the customer and evidence of the provision of those services exist.
For
further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies, refer to Note 2 – “Revenue Recognition” in
these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 2 “Summary of Accounting Policies” in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
Recoverability
of Deferred Costs
We
defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install
systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll
costs for our employees and other third parties.
We
recognize such costs on a contract by contract basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. For revenue recognized under
the completed contract method, costs are deferred until the products are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where applicable,
customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as products are delivered
or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized ratably over the term of
the contract, costs are also recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each
balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts
are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.
23
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company’s differences arise principally from the
use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used
for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company’s future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences
as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly,
deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse.
For
income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent
with the Company’s financial reporting under GAAP.
Intangible
Assets
Intangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill),
customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase
price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment
may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods
of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period
of benefit. Annually, or sooner if there is indication of a loss in value, we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and consider
events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. There were no impairment
charges during the periods presented.
The
first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with
its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill
is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill is reduced by the excess of the carrying amount of
the reporting unit over that reporting unit’s fair value. Goodwill can never be reduced below zero, if any. At the end of each
year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings.
Consolidated
Results of Operations
Our consolidated financial results include the
results of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. Foreign subsidiaries results are translated from their functional currencies to
USD for reporting purposes. Fluctuations in currency can therefore impact our translated revenue. One factor in the Current Quarter
is that the translated revenue of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was impacted by currency fluctuations as a result of the
strengthening of the USD against the Pound and the Danish Kroner. During the Current Quarter our consolidated revenue was $5,596,284
compared to $5,838,208 in the Previous Quarter, representing a decrease of 4.1%. However, applying the same exchange rate as the
Previous Quarter, revenue of our foreign subsidiaries would have increased by $342,146 resulting in an increase in consolidated
revenue in the Current Quarter by 1.7% over the Previous Quarter. During the Current Quarter total operating expenses fell by 13.5%
and Income from operations fell by 2.2%. This was affected by the high percentage of agents’ commissions incurred on sales of
our technology in Asia in the Current Quarter – which were $486,341 compared to $138,372 in the Previous Quarter, representing
an increase on commission recorded of 251% over the Previous Quarter (see Notes 14 and 15 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information on Segment reporting and Disaggregation of Revenue by Segment and geography). Net income before
taxes fell by 5.7% and was $1,361,861 compared to $1,444,648 and net income after taxes was $1,397,857 compared to $1,217,248,
representing an increase of 14.8%.
Segment
Summary
Products
Business
In the Current Quarter, the Products Business generated
$3,824,159 or 68.3% of our consolidated revenues compared to $3,823,748 or 65.5% in the Previous Quarter and was broadly in line with
the Previous Quarter. Although in its native currency the foreign subsidiaries revenue increased over the Previous Quarter, the USD equivalent
was reduced due to the sharp depreciation of the British Pound and Danish Kroner against the USD. Gross Profit Margin fell by 15% and
was 72% in the Current Quarter compared to 85% in Previous Quarter due to the significant agents’ commissions we incurred on sales.
A significant proportion of the Products Business’ sales in the Current Quarter was conducted through sales agents due to geographic
location of sales (Asia) and we recorded commission of $486,341 in the Current Quarter compared to $138,372 in the Previous Quarter, representing
a 251% increase in this area. In the Current Quarter Total Operating Expenses fell in the Products Business by 14.3% and was $1,100,067
compared to $1,282,989 in the Previous Quarter.
Services
Business
In the Current Quarter, the Services Business generated
$1,772,125 or 31.7% of our consolidated revenues compared to $2,014,460 or 34.5% in the Previous Quarter, representing a fall in sales
of 12%. The main factor in the fall in sales in the Services Business is that it is experiencing delays in both closing
contracts and progressing existing contracts with its prime defense contractor customers due to supply chain issues. A number of projects
have stalled due to component shortage and also several of its key opportunities have stalled in the Current Quarter due to ongoing supply
chain issues. This has resulted in a fall in the revenues of this segment in the Current Quarter. Gross Profit Margin was 56%
compared to 45%, reflecting the types of engineering projects performed during the reporting period. Total Operating Expenses
fell by 17.9% and was $652,460 compared to $794,664.

Results
of Operations for the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter
Revenue :
Total consolidated revenues for the Current Quarter and the Previous Quarter were $5,596,284 and $5,838,208 respectively,
representing a decrease of 4.1%. This is caused by the Services Business revenue decreasing by 12.0% due to order take slowing
because of supply chain issues on broader defense programs. This has resulted in delays in our customers placing orders.
Additionally, the Company’s foreign subsidiaries revenues were impacted by currency fluctuations caused by the sharp
depreciation of the Pound, Euro and Danish Kroner against the USD. A significant part of our revenues is derived from our foreign
subsidiaries in the UK and Denmark and therefore for the purpose of our financial reporting, the functional currencies of these
subsidiaries are translated into USD. Applying the same exchange rate as the Previous Quarter, revenue of our foreign subsidiaries
would have increased by $342,146 and be largely in line with the Previous Quarter
Gross
Profit Margins :
Margin percentage was weaker in the Current Quarter at 67.1% (gross profit of
$3,753,005) compared to 71.3% (gross profit of $4,159,934) in the Previous Quarter. The main factor which affected Gross Profit Margins
in the Current Quarter was the level of sales commission incurred. A significant percentage of recorded sales generated by the Products
Business emanated from Asia and these were conducted through sales agents, resulting in increased commission level. For the Products Business
we recorded $486,341 in commission in the Current Quarter compared to $138,372 in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 251%.
Gross
profit margins reported in our financial results may vary according to several factors. These include:
●
The percentage
of consolidated sales attributed to the Marine Technology Business versus the Services Business. The gross profit margin yielded
by the Marine Technology Business is generally higher than that of the Services Business.
●
The
percentage of consolidated sales attributed to the Services Business. The Services Business yields a lower gross profit margin on
generated sales which are largely based on time and materials for our Department of Defense contracts (DoD sub-contracts).
●
The mix of
sales within the Marine Technology Business during the reporting period:
●
Outright Sale versus Rentals.
●
Hardware Sale versus Software,
software is generally higher margin.
●
Mix of Services rendered
in the period – Offshore Engineering Services versus paid Customer Research and Development Projects.
●
Level
of commissions on products which may vary according to volume. Both the Services and Marine Technology Businesses work with sales/distribution
agents. Most of the Marine Technology Business sales in Asia is via agents or distributors. See Note 3 “Cost of Goods Sold” for more discussion on this.
●
Level
of Rental Assets in the Marine Technology Business’ Rental Pool and therefore the depreciation expenses may vary accordingly.
●
The mix of engineering projects performed by our Services Business (Design
prototyping versus manufacturing), may also affect Gross Profit Margins.
In
the Current Quarter, gross profit margins for the Products Business were 72.2% compared to 85.0% in the Previous Quarter. For the Services
Business these were 56.0% in the Current Quarter compared to 45.1% in the Previous Quarter.
Since
there are more variable factors affecting gross profit margins in the Marine Technology Business (Products Business), a table showing a summary of
break-out of sales generated by the this business in the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter is set out
below:

In
the Current Quarter the Marine Technology Business incurred commission costs of $486,341
compared to $138,372 in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 251%, resulting in gross profit margins being lower. A significant
percentage of our sales in foreign territories such as South Korea, Japan and China are conducted through our sales agents and distributors.
Further
information on the performance in the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter of each business segment including revenues by type
and geography can be found in Notes 14 and Note 15 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.
Research
and Development (R&D) : R&D expenditures in the Current Quarter were $444,458 compared to $672,890 in the Previous Quarter,
representing a decrease of 33.9%.

The
decrease in R&D expenditures is a reflection that we had less R&D projects ongoing in the Current Quarter.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) :
SG&A expenses for the Current Quarter fell by 7.0% to $1,962,451 from $2,111,112
in the Previous Quarter.
The
fall in SG&A in the Current Quarter is largely due recording of a significantly lower non-cash charge relating to stock compensation,
which was $182,153 as compared to $325,175 in the Previous Quarter, representing a 44.0% reduction.
Within
the category of SG&A we have transactions which are cash charges and non-cash charges. The non-cash charges comprise Depreciation,
Amortization and Stock-based compensation charges. In the Current Quarter non-cash items as a percentage of SG&A expenses was 14.5% compared
to 22.0% in the Previous Quarter.
Key
Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Company for the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter are:

Increase of 48.5%
Although
in the Current Quarter “Wages and Salaries” have fallen, we believe on the full year basis this category will increase due
to inflation and potential new hires to fill open positions. Our revision of salaries for the Fiscal Year 2023 will start to be recorded in our second quarter,
due to the date when these increases became effective.
The
increase in “Legal and Professional” reflects an increase in audit fees.
The
increase in marketing is anticipated within our plans. This is an area of expenditures which we anticipate will increase materially in
this fiscal year and subsequent years. As we shift our focus from R&D to business development and marketing, including undertaking
efforts to build our brands, we anticipate a significant increase in this area of expenditure.
Operating
Income : In the Current Quarter Operating Income marginally fell by 2.2% and was $1,346,096 as compared to $1,375,932 in the
Previous Quarter. The slight decrease in Operating Income is due to the fall in our consolidated revenues and gross profit margins
realized in the Current Quarter.
Other
Income : In the Current Quarter, we had Other Income of $15,765 compared to $68,716, representing a decrease of 77.1% from
the Previous Quarter. In the Current Quarter $12,861 of this amount represents interest earned on our deposits. We have established certified
deposit accounts with our bankers and would expect that interest earned will be material in the future. See Note 17 (“Subsequent
Events”) where we discuss this further.
Net
Income before income taxes : In the Current Quarter, we had income before income taxes of $1,361,861 as compared to
$1,444,648 in the Previous Quarter, representing a decrease of 5.7%. Net income before income taxes fell due to the decrease in our
consolidated revenues compounded by the decrease in Gross Profit Margins in the Current Quarter.
26
Net Income:
In the Current Quarter
we had Net Income of $1,397,857 compared to $1,217,248 in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 14.8%. In the Previous
Quarter we recorded Current Tax Expense of $285,609 and in the Current Quarter we recorded Current Tax Benefit of $35,996. The
Company has utilized all its net operating losses carryforwards. Our tax liability included in our consolidated financial results
will depend on the composition of our consolidated income, whether they relate to the Company’s foreign subsidiaries or US
subsidiaries and similarly the percentage of consolidated income from US and Foreign subsidiaries. In the Current Quarter, the
Company and its US subsidiaries had no taxable income. The UK companies have carryforward losses which will be applied to defray
income tax liability and therefore no provision has been made for tax liability for the foreign subsidiaries in our consolidated
results for the Current Quarter.
Comprehensive Income .
In the
Current Quarter Comprehensive income was $3,005,507 compared to Comprehensive Income of $1,458,398 for the Previous Quarter reflecting
adjustments resulting from foreign currency translations. This category is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange transactions
both relating to our profit and loss expenses and valuation of our assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. In the Previous Quarter
we had a gain of $241,150 on foreign currency translation adjustment transactions compared to a gain of $1,607,650 in the Current Quarter.
A significant part of the Company’s operations is based in the UK and Denmark, and therefore a major part of our assets and liabilities
recorded in our consolidated balance sheet and financial transactions are translated from the functional currencies of these subsidiaries
into USD for reporting purposes. See Table 2 under the section which concerns “Inflation & Foreign Currency” which shows
the impact of the currency adjustments on our Income Statement and Balance Sheet in the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of $12,778,779, working capital of $36,474,417, cash of $24,522,383 and stockholders’ equity of $46,570,469. For the Current
Quarter, the Company’s operating activities provided cash of $984,866.
The Company entered into a $4,000,000 revolving line
of credit with HSBC NA on November 27, 2019, at prime. The outstanding balance on the line of credit was $0 as of January 31, 2023. This
revolving credit line will expire on November 26, 2023, unless renewed.

Inflation
and Foreign Currency
The
Company maintains its books in functional currency, as follows:
●
US
Dollars for US Operations.
●
British
Pound for United Kingdom Operations.
●
Danish
Kroner for our Danish Operations.
●
Australian
Dollars for our Australian Operations.
●
Indian
Rupees for our Indian Operations.

Fluctuations
in currency exchange rates can affect the Company’s sales, profitability and financial position when the foreign currencies of
its international operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting. In addition, we are also subject to currency fluctuation
risk with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. The Company cannot predict the extent to which currency
fluctuations may affect the Company’s business and financial position, and there is a risk that such fluctuations will have an
adverse impact on the Company’s sales, profits and financial position. Also, because differing portions of our revenues and costs
are denominated in foreign currency, movements can impact our margins by, for example, decreasing our foreign revenues when the dollar
strengthens without correspondingly decreasing our expenses. The Company does not currently hedge its currency exposure.
Applying
the Constant Rate, the impact of currency fluctuations on the three months ended January 31, 2023, is shown below. In this context
“Constant Rates” is defined as:

Item
4. Controls and Procedures
a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The
Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial (and principal accounting) Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of January 31, 2023. Based upon
that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to the material weakness previously identified in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed on with the SEC on January 30, 2023.
The
material weakness concerned a lack of adequate processes and procedures regarding the review of the elimination entries pertaining to
the consolidation process.
We
have implemented new controls and procedures that we believe will address the material weakness described above and will carefully
monitor the effectiveness of these controls and procedures over the next several quarterly consolidations to determine their
effectiveness in addressing the material weakness.
We
have implemented additional qualitative and quantitative controls over eliminations including implementing metrics that will be
compared to each quarter’s results and deviations from those metrics will be investigated before the consolidation is
considered complete. We have also expanded the review of the quarterly and annual consolidation process.
28
(b)
Changes in Internal Controls.
During
the period covered by this report, except as disclosed above, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item
1. Legal Proceedings
From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate,
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
