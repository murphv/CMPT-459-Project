CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future
events that are intended as “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. All statements included or incorporated by reference in this report, other than statements of historical fact, that address
activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.
These statements appear in a number of places, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.” These statements represent our reasonable judgment about the future based on various factors and using
numerous assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results
and financial position to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. You can identify these statements by the fact
that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
“could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “may,” “should,”
“plan,” “potential,” “project,” “will,” “would” and other words of similar
meaning, or the negatives of such terms or other variations. These include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following:
●
projected
operating or financial results, including anticipated cash flows used in operations;
●
expectations
regarding capital expenditures, research and development expenses and other payments;
●
our
beliefs and assumptions relating to our liquidity position, including our ability to obtain additional financing; and
●
our
beliefs, assumptions and expectations about the regulatory approval for our technology including, but not limited to our ability
to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all.
Any
or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They may be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors including, among others:
●
our
ability to continue as a going concern;
●
our
ability to remain current in filing all reports required to be filed by us under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934;
●
our
ability to maintain pricing;
●
our
ability to employ skilled and qualified workers;
●
the
fact that we have incurred significant losses since inception, expect to incur net losses for at least the next several years and
may never achieve or sustain profitability;
●
the
loss of key management personnel upon whom we depend;
●
our
ability to fund our operations;
●
inadequate
insurance coverage for certain losses or liabilities;
●
our
ability to navigate the regulatory approval process in the U.S. and other countries, and our success in obtaining required regulatory
approvals on a timely basis;
●
commercial
development of technologies that compete with our technology;
●
the
actual and perceived effectiveness of our technology, and how the technology compares to competitive technologies;
●
the
rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our technology;
●
adverse
effects of the recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;
●
the
strength of our intellectual property protection, and our success in avoiding infringement of the intellectual property rights of
others;
●
regulations
affecting the health care industry;
●
adverse
developments in our research and development activities;
●
potential
liability if our technology causes illness, injury or death, or adverse publicity from any such events;
●
our
ability to operate our business efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs (including general and administrative expenses)
and obtain financing when required; and
●
our
expectations with respect to future licensing, partnering or acquisition activity.
In
addition, there may be other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the results referenced in the
forward-looking statements, some of which are included elsewhere in this report, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on December 29, 2022 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), particularly in the ‘Risk Factors” section of such reports, that could cause results or events
to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make herein. Many of these factors will be important in determining
our actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement should be relied upon. Our actual future results may vary materially
from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are qualified
in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements apply only as of the date they are made, and we disclaim any
obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as otherwise
required by applicable law.

CONDENSED
NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER

(UNAUDITED)
NOTE
1 -
ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Theralink
Technologies, Inc., formerly OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”), was a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company
engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a proprietary vaccine technology. On June 5, 2020, the Company
acquired the assets (the “Asset Sale Transaction”) of Avant Diagnostics, Inc., a Nevada corporation established in 2009 (“Avant”)
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated May 12, 2020, between the Company and Avant (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”).
Avant is a commercial-stage precision medicine and molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization
of a series of patented, proprietary data-generating assays that may provide important actionable information for physicians and patients,
as well as biopharmaceutical companies, in the area of oncology.
Pursuant
to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Avant and assumed certain of its liabilities.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Avant sold to the Company, all of Avant’s title and
interest in all the assets, properties and rights of every kind and nature, whether real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible (including
goodwill), wherever located and whether existing or hereafter acquired, except for the specific excluded assets, which relate to, or
are used or held for use in connection with, Avant’s business. The Company also hired Avant’s employees upon consummation
of the Asset Sale Transaction. As consideration for the Asset Sale Transaction, the Company issued to Avant
1,000
shares of a newly created
Series D-1 Preferred Stock which held
54.55 % of all voting rights on an as-converted basis with the common stock. Upon the effectiveness
of an increase of the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from
6,666,667
shares to
12,000,000,000
shares, all such shares
of Series D-1 Preferred Stock issued to Avant automatically converted into
5,081,549,184
shares of the Company’s common stock.
Avant possessed majority voting control of the Company immediately following the Asset Sale Transaction and controlled the Company’s
Board of Directors after the termination of the ten-day waiting period required by Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the
Asset Sale Transaction was accounted for, in substance, as an asset acquisition of the Company’s net asset by Avant and a recapitalization
of Avant .
Avant is considered the historical registrant and the historical operations presented are those of Avant since Avant
obtained
54.55 % majority voting control of the Company. All share and per share data in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes
has been retrospectively adjusted for the recapitalization.
On
July 11, 2021, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OncBioMune, LLC, was administratively dissolved by the Louisiana Secretary
of State for failing to meet its filing requirements and pay the associated fees.
In
connection with the Asset Sale Transaction, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement, effective June 5, 2020, by and among OncBioMune
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the investors named therein, whereby the Company agreed to exchange certain convertible promissory notes and
warrants outstanding for shares of Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company and options to purchase shares of the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary, OncBioMune Sub Inc. OncBioMune Sub Inc. holds the patents used in the prior business of OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. In July 2021, certain of those investors exercised their options to purchase the shares of OncBioMune Sub Inc. On July 26, 2021,
the Company transferred all
10,000
shares of OncBioMune Sub Inc. held by the Company to the various investors for gross proceeds of $ 1,000
(see Note 3).
On
February 25, 2022, FINRA recognized the Company’s name change to Theralink Technologies, Inc. and the related ticker symbol change
from “OBMP” to “THER” went into effect.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
for interim financial information, which present the unaudited financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2022. The interim
unaudited financial statements do not include all the information and notes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position
and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the September 30, 2022 audited financial statements on Form 10-K filed
on December 29, 2022. It is management’s opinion that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and
non-recurring adjustments) have been made for the fair presentation of the unaudited financial statements. The results for the interim
period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending September 30, 2023.

Going
Concern
These
unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the
Company had net loss and net cash used in operations of $ 36,456,347
and $ 1,776,349 , respectively, for the three months ended December
31, 2022. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit, stockholders’ deficit and working capital deficit of $ 99,303,616 ,
$ 44,302,919
and $ 44,998,742
on December 31, 2022. Management believes that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report.
The
Company cannot provide assurance that it will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional
debt or equity capital. Additionally, the current capital resources are not adequate to continue operating and maintaining the business
strategy for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The Company will seek to raise capital through additional
debt and equity financings to fund its operations in the future.
Although
the Company has historically raised capital from sales of equity and the issuance of promissory notes, convertible notes and convertible
debentures, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or
secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail or cease operations. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that
affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management
bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable
under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Significant estimates during the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include, but are not necessarily limited to, estimates of contingent
liabilities, valuation of marketable securities, useful life of property and equipment, valuation of right-of-use ROU assets and lease liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, allowances for accounts receivable, estimates
of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the fair value of derivative liabilities, and the fair value
of non-cash equity transactions.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
FASB
ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures
about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the
fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to the Company on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the
estimates presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on the disposition
of the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation
techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable
inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of
the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level
1—Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
Level
2—Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level
3—Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, contract liabilities, and accrued compensation approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity
of these instruments.

ASC
825-10 “Financial Instruments” allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless
a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should
be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding
equity instruments.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company’s investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. The Company periodically monitors its positions with,
and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests.
Prepaid
Assets
Prepaid
assets are carried at amortized cost. Significant prepaid assets as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 include, but are not
necessarily limited to, prepaid insurance, prepaid consulting fees, prepaid equipment maintenance fees and retainers for professional
services.
Laboratory
Supplies
Laboratory
supplies are normally consumed within a year from purchase and any unused laboratory supplies are classified as current assets and reflected
in the accompanying balance sheets as laboratory supplies.
Property
and Equipment
Fixed
assets are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from
three
to
five years . Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term including scheduled renewal
terms. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. The Company examines
the possibility of decreases in the value of these assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded
value may not be recoverable.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
In
accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss
when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured
as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value.

Stock-Based
Compensation
Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 –
“Compensation –Stock Compensation ”,
which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange
for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee
services received in exchange for an award be based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures
as they occur as permitted under the FASB’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09
Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment .
Revenue
Recognition and Contract Assets and Liabilities
In
accordance with ASU Topic 606 -
Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that
core principle by applying the following steps:
Step
1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Step
3: Determine the transaction price.
Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
Step
5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The
Company provides research and development support to biopharmaceutical companies to assist their drug development programs. In January
2021, the Company began performing tumor profiling to support clinical patient therapeutic intervention. The services provided by the
Company are performance obligations under services contracts. These contracts are completed over time and may lead to deferred revenue
for services not completed at the end of a period which is reflected as contract liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. The Company
may include, in accounts receivable, amounts billed to customers in advance of services being initiated or completed. If the Company
has a right to such consideration that is unconditional such as for contractually allowed billings under non-cancellable contracts, such
amounts billed in advance would be offset by a contract liability. Management reviews the completion status of all jobs monthly to determine
the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize. The Company offers these services to biopharmaceutical companies and to private individuals.
The Company uses various output methods to recognize revenues. The revenue recognized from services provided to private individuals during
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were minimal and therefore were not disaggregated for disclosure purposes.
Contract
Liabilities
Contract
liabilities are cash deposits received from customers and advance billing included in accounts receivable on uncompleted contracts for
which revenues have not been recognized as of the balance sheet date.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, contract liabilities activity is as follows:

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade
receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Trade credit is generally extended on a short-term basis and does not
bear interest. Trade accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers and
their current financial condition.
Any
charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the
allowance for uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate to cover any probable losses. Management determines the
adequacy of the allowance based on historical write-off percentages and the current status of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable
are charged off against the allowance when collectability is determined to be permanently impaired.
Research
and Development
In
fiscal 2022, the Company joined and made an investment in an investigator-initiated study. As part of that investment, the Company obtained
rights/access to various retrospective biobank clinical samples for research and product development purposes. In addition, the Company
received active patient clinical samples for the following disease sites: ovarian, endometrial, and head & neck cancers. These samples
were tested to provide RUO (Research Use Only) results reports for research and product validation efforts.
The transaction term is for
5-years, starting in September 2021 . During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had spent $ 50,000
and $ 25,000
on this research and development project, which is included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying unaudited statements
of operations.
Derivative
Liabilities
The
Company has certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. The Company evaluates all its
financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives
to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10
- Derivative and Hedging - Contract in Entity’s Own Equity .
This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market
at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change
in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective
derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is
reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on debt extinguishment.
Concentrations
Concentration
of Credit Risk
The
Company maintains its cash in banks and financial institutions that at times may exceed the federally insured limit of $ 250,000 . As of

Concentration
of Vendors
Historically,
the Company relied on one vendor to perform the Company’s patient reporting and contract research (formerly called sample analysis)
which is an integral part of the Company’s operation and revenue stream. Any disruption in this service could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company discontinued using this vendor in
June 2022 as the patient reporting function has been moved in-house.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $ 0
and $ 113,295 , respectively, or 100%, of its patient reporting
and contract research (formerly called sample analysis) expense from one vendor.
Basic
and Diluted Loss Per Share
Pursuant
to ASC 260-10-45, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive
common shares consist of common stock issuable for stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method), convertible notes, conversion
of preferred stock, and common stock issuable. These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future. The following potentially
dilutive equity securities outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not included in the computation of dilutive loss per common
share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive:

Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income tax using the liability method prescribed by ASC 740 - Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation
allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or
all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or
loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
The
Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740
“Income Taxes ”.
Using that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position
will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had
no
uncertain tax positions
that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related
to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. However,
no
such interest and penalties were recorded as of December 31, 2022 and
2021.
Related
Parties
Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management,
members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may
deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one
of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.

Leases
The
Company accounts for its leases using the method prescribed by ASC 842 –
Lease Accounting . The Company assess whether a
contract is, or contains, a lease at the inception of the contract which is based on (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct
identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout
the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company allocates the consideration in the
contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. The Company has elected not
to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less.
Operating
and financing lease ROU assets represent the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. Operating and financing lease liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As most
leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption
date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited statements of operations.

under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any indebtedness for borrowed money or money due under
any long term leasing or factoring arrangement that (a) involves an obligation greater than $ 250,000 , whether such indebtedness now exists
or shall hereafter be created, and (b) results in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which
it would otherwise become due and payable, the New Related Party Debenture shall be deemed in default and the default provisions shall

Analysis
of Exchange Agreements, Related Party Debenture and New Debentures, and Related Warrants
In
accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments, the Company performed an assessment of whether the Exchange Agreement
transactions with related parties and investors was deemed to be new debt, a modification of existing debt, or an extinguishment of existing
debt. The Company evaluated the November 29, 2022 Exchange Agreements for debt modification and concluded that the debt exchanges qualified
for debt extinguishment. The Company determined the transactions were considered a debt extinguishment because the change in debt, the
inducement premiums (related parties and third parties) discussed previously totaling $ 1,724,489 , and the issuance of new warrants was
substantial. Upon extinguishment, the Company had an aggregate of $ 3,718,288
of unamortized initial debt discount recorded which was
written off and included in loss on debt extinguishment on the accompanying unaudited statement of operations during the three months
ended December 31, 2022.
Derivative
Liabilities Pursuant to Related Party Debentures and New Debentures and Related Warrants
Pursuant
to the provisions of ASC 815-40 –
Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in an Entity’s Own Stock , the New Related
Party Debentures, the New Debenture, and the New warrants issued in connection with the Exchange Agreements were analyzed and it was
determined that the terms of the New Related Party Debentures, New Debentures and the related warrants contained terms that were considered
derivatives due to the variable conversion of the Debentures and exercise price of the warrants, and other provisions which includes
events not within the control of the Company. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the embedded conversion option contained in the Notes and
the Warrants were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through earnings
at each reporting date. The fair value of the embedded conversion options and warrants was determined using the Binomial Lattice valuation
model. At the end of each period and on the date notes convert or are repaid, the Company revalues the derivative liabilities resulting
from the embedded options and warrants.
In
connection with the issuance of the New Related Party Debentures and the New Debentures and related warrants, on November 29, 2022, the
initial measurement date, the aggregate fair values of the embedded conversion option derivatives and warrant derivatives of $ 41,961,095
was recorded as derivative liabilities and was attributable to the following: 1) $ 21,986,653
of derivative liabilities was attributable
to the New Related Party Debentures and related warrants which was allocated to debt discount up to the net principal amount of the New
Related Party Debentures of $ 8,837,284 , with the remainder of $ 13,149,369
charged to current period operations as initial derivative
expense, and 2) $ 19,974,442
of derivative liabilities was attributable to the New Debentures and related warrants which was allocated
to debt discount up to the net principal amount of the New Debentures of $ 7,231,894 , with the remainder of $ 12,742,548
charged to current
period operations as initial derivative expense. At the end of the period, the Company revalued the embedded conversion option derivative
liabilities and warrant derivative liabilities and recorded a derivative expense of $ 505,158 . In connection with the revaluation and
the initial derivative expense, the Company recorded an aggregate derivative expense of $ 26,397,075
during the three months ended December
31, 2022.
The
Company uses the Binomial Valuation Model to determine the fair value of its conversion options and new stock warrants which requires
the Company to make several key judgments including:
●
the
value of the Company’s common stock;
●
the
expected life of issued stock warrants;
●
the
expected volatility of the Company’s stock price;
●
the
expected dividend yield to be realized over the life of the stock warrants; and
●
the
risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the stock warrants.

Holders
of Series E Preferred Stock have no voting rights.
On
September 16, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with an affiliated investor, who
is a beneficial shareholder, to purchase an aggregate amount of
1,000
shares of the newly created Series E Convertible Preferred Stock
of the Company (the “Series E Preferred”) for an aggregate investment amount of $ 2,000,000 .
Pursuant
to the Series E Certificate of Designation, Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the holder in the event that the
Company is prohibited from issuing shares of common stock to a holder upon any conversion due to insufficient shares of common stock
available (“Authorized Failure Shares”) and therefore meets the criteria of a contingently redeemable instrument in accordance
with ASC 480-10-25-7 –
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The Series E Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable upon
the occurrence of an event that is outside of the issuer’s control and is classified as temporary equity pursuant to ASC 480-10-S99.
Further
the Series E Preferred Stock is an equity host instrument since it has more features that align with an equity instrument than a debt
instrument pursuant to ASC 815-15-25-17A –
Derivatives and Hedging , which states in part that “ the nature of the
host contract depends on the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument.”
All of the contractual
and implied terms of the preferred share, such as the existence of a redemption feature or conversion option, should be considered when
determining the nature of the host instrument as debt or equity. The Series E Preferred Stock embedded conversion feature (call option)
is considered clearly and closely related to the equity host. Accordingly, further analysis under ASC 815-40-15 is not necessary and
the embedded conversion feature should not be bifurcated from the host instrument. The Series E Preferred Stock redemption feature (put
option) does not meet all the criteria under ASC 815-10-15-83, therefore it does not qualify as a derivative.
To
determine whether the Series E Preferred Stock contains a BCF, we compared the effective conversion price and the Company’s stock
price on the commitment date. The effective conversion price was calculated by dividing the proceeds from Series E Preferred Stock by
the number of common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock. The BCF is measured as the difference between the
commitment date stock price and the effective conversion price multiplied by the number of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series
E. The BCF is limited to the total cash proceeds received if the amount of the BCF exceeds the cash proceeds received. In connection
with the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, during the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized a beneficial conversion
feature in the amount of $ 2,000,000
which was accounted for as a deemed dividend.
During
the year ended September 30, 2021, the issuance of Series F Preferred Stock triggered the price protection clause in the Series E Preferred
Stock. Thus, the conversion price of the Series E Preferred Stock was reduced from $ 0.00375
to $ 0.00313
on that date.
On
November 29, 2022, the Company entered into Securities Exchange Agreements with related party preferred stockholders, whereby related party holders of
1,000
shares of Series E preferred stock
with a stated value of $ 2,000,000

0
and
1,000
shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued and outstanding classified
as temporary equity in the accompanying unaudited balance sheets, respectively.
Series
F Preferred Stock
On
July 30, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series F Preferred Stock (the “Series
F Certificate of Designation”), with the Nevada Secretary of State to designate
1,000
shares of its previously authorized preferred
stock as Series F Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share and a stated value of $ 2,000
per share. The Series F Certificate of Designation
and its filing were approved by the Company’s Board of Directors without stockholder approval as provided for in the Company’s
Articles of Incorporation and under Nevada law. The holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock have the following preferences and
rights:
●
From
the Initial Issuance Date, cumulative dividends on each share of Series F shall accrue, on a monthly basis in arrears (with any partial
month being made on a pro-rata basis), at the rate of
8 % per annum on the stated value, plus any additional amount thereon. Dividends
shall be paid within 15 days after the end of each month (“Dividend Payment Date”), at the option of the Holder in cash
or through the issuance of shares of common stock. In the event that the Holder elects to receive its dividends in shares of common
stock the number of shares of common stock to be issued to each applicable Holder shall be determined by dividing the total dividend
payable to such Holder by the average closing price of the common stock during the five trading days on the principal market prior
to the dividend payment date.
●
Holders
of shares of Series F Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends or distributions on each share on an “as converted” into
common stock basis, if, as and when declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.
●
Each
share of Series F Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock any time after the initial issuance date at the conversion
price which is the lesser of: (i) $0.00313 or (ii) 75% of the average closing price of the common stock during the prior five trading
days on the principal market, subject to adjustment as provided in the Series F Certificate of Designation including a price protection
provision for offerings below the conversion price, provided, however, the conversion price shall never be less than $0.0016. The
number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by
the stated value per share of $2,000 plus additional amount by the conversion price.
●
In
connection with, (i) a Change of Control of the Company or (ii) on the closing of, a Qualified Public Offering by the Company, all
of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock (including any fraction of a share) shall automatically convert along with
the additional amount into an aggregate number of shares of common stock (including any fraction of a share) as is determined by
dividing the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock (including any fraction of a share) by the automatic conversion price then
in effect. If a closing of a Change of Control transaction or a Qualified Public Offering occurs, such automatic conversion of all
of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of common stock immediately
prior to the closing of such transaction or Qualified Public Offering.
●
In
the event the Company issues or sells any securities including options or convertible securities, except for any Exempt Issuance
(as defined in the Series F Certificate of Designation), at a price, an exercise price or conversion price of less than the conversion
price, then upon such issuance or sale, the Series F Preferred Stock conversion price shall be reduced to the sale price, or the
exercise price or conversion price of the securities sold.
●
Series
F Preferred Stock shall rank pari passu with respect to the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation,
dissolution and winding up of the Company with the Series C-1 Preferred Stock of the Company, the Series C-2 Preferred Stock of the
Company, and the Series E Preferred Stock of the Corporation (the “Parity Stock”), and all other shares of capital stock
of the Company shall be junior in rank to all Series F shares with respect to the preferences as to dividends (except for the common
stock, which shall be pari passu as provided in the Series F Certificate of Designation), distributions and payments upon the liquidation,
dissolution and winding up of the Company (such junior stock is referred to herein collectively as “Junior Stock”). The
rights of all such Junior Stock shall be subject to the rights, powers, preferences and privileges of the Series F Preferred Stock.
Without limiting any other provision of the Series F Certificate of Designation, without the prior express consent of the Required
Holder, the Company shall not hereafter authorize or issue any additional or other shares of capital stock that is (i) of senior
rank to the Series F Preferred Stock in respect of the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation,
dissolution and winding up of the Company (collectively, the “Senior Preferred Stock”), or (ii) Parity Stock. Except
as provided for in the Certificate of Designation, in the event of the merger or consolidation of the Company into another corporation,
the Series F Preferred Stock shall maintain their relative rights, powers, designations, privileges and preferences provided for
in the Certificate of Designation for a period of at least two years following such merger or consolidation and no such merger or
consolidation shall cause result inconsistent therewith.

(UNAUDITED)
On
July 30, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with an affiliated investor, who is a
beneficial shareholder, to purchase an aggregate amount of
500
shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series F Preferred”)
with accompanying warrant for
63,897,764
of common stock (the “Warrant”), for total proceeds of $ 1,000,000
(see Note 9).
The Series F Preferred Stock has a stated value of $ 2,000
per share and shall accrue monthly in arrears, dividends at the rate of
8 %
per annum on the stated value. The dividends shall be paid monthly at the option of the holder of the Series F Preferred in either cash
or shares of common stock of the Company.
The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred is
determined by dividing the stated value of the number of shares being converted, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, by the lesser
of: (i) $0.00313 and (ii) 75% of the average closing price of the Company’s common stock during the prior five trading days; provided,
however, the conversion price shall never be less than $0.0016. In addition, the investor was issued a Warrant to purchase an amount
of common stock equal to 20% of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred at an exercise price of
$0.00313 per share (subject to adjustment as provided therein) until July 30, 2026. The Warrants are exercisable for cash at any time.
The 63,897,764 Warrant was valued using the relative fair value method at $957,192 and the Series F Preferred stock had a grant date
fair value $42,808 which was recorded as a BCF.
In
accordance with ASC 470 – Debt, the proceeds of $ 1,000,000
was allocated based on the relative fair values of the Series F preferred
stock and the Warrant of $ 42,808
and $ 957,192 , respectively. Although ASC 470 is for debt instruments issued with warrants, preferred
shares issued with warrants should be accounted for in a similar manner.
Pursuant
to the Series F Certificate of Designation, Series F Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the holder in the event that the
Company is prohibited from issuing shares of common stock to a holder upon any conversion due to insufficient shares of common stock
available (“Authorized Failure Shares”) and therefore meets the criteria of a contingently redeemable instrument in accordance
with ASC 480-10-25-7 –
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The Series F Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable upon
the occurrence of an event that is outside of the issuer’s control and should be classified as temporary equity pursuant to ASC
480-10-S99. Further the Series F Preferred Stock is an equity host instrument since it has more features that align with an equity instrument
than a debt instrument pursuant to ASC 815-15-25-17A –
Derivatives and Hedging , which states in part that “ the
nature of the host contract depends on the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument.”
All
of the contractual and implied terms of the preferred share, such as the existence of a redemption feature or conversion option, should
be considered when determining the nature of the host instrument as debt or equity. The Series F Preferred Stock embedded conversion
feature (call option) is considered clearly and closely related to the equity host. Accordingly, further analysis under ASC 815-40-15
is not necessary and the embedded conversion feature should not be bifurcated from the host instrument. The Series F Preferred Stock
redemption feature (put option) does not meet all the criteria under ASC 815-10-15-83, therefore it does not qualify as a derivative.
To
determine whether the Series F Preferred Stock contains a BCF, we compared the effective conversion price and the Company’s stock
price on the commitment date. The effective conversion price was calculated by dividing the proceeds from Series F Preferred Stock by
the number of common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock. The BCF is measured as the difference between the
commitment date stock price and the effective conversion price multiplied by the number of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series
F. The BCF is limited to the total cash proceeds received if the amount of the BCF exceeds the cash proceeds received. In connection
with the issuance of Series F Preferred Stock, during the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized a BCF in the amount of
$ 42,808
which was accounted for as a deemed dividend.
The
relative fair value of the warrant of $ 957,192
was recorded as a discount associated with the Series F preferred stock and was fully
amortized immediately because the Series F preferred stock was convertible on the date of issuance. The Company recorded the $ 957,192
as deemed dividend.
On
November 29, 2022, the Company entered into Securities Exchange Agreements with related party preferred stockholders, whereby
related party holders of
500
shares of Series F preferred stock with a stated value of $ 1,000,000
and accrued dividends payable of $ 33,315
were exchanged for the New Related Party Debentures (See Note 6).

2022, the Board terminated the 2020 Plan and any shares reserved thereunder are no longer subject to reservation and the Company had
no options issued and outstanding under the 2020 Plan.
On
April 18, 2022, the Company’s Board and the shareholders approved the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (“2022 Plan”) at which
time the plan became effective. Upon the effective date of the 2022 Plan,
1,915,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock were
reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan (“Reserved Share Amount”), subject to the adjustments described in the 2022 Plan,
and such Reserved Share Amount, when issued in accordance with the 2022 Plan, shall be validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable.
Pursuant to the 2022 Plan, the option price of each incentive stock option (except those that constitute substitute awards) shall be
at least the fair market value of a share on the grant date; provided, however, that in the event that a grantee is a ten percent stockholder
as of the grant date, the option price of an incentive stock option shall be not less than
110 % of the fair market value of a share on
the grant date, in no case shall the option price of any option be less than the par value of a share.
On
May 26, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) approved the future granting of stock options under the 2022
Equity Incentive Plan, to various employees and consultants. On August 16, 2022, the Company granted stock options to purchase

common shares of the Company to various employees and consultants with an exercise price of $ 0.0036
per share. The options expire on
August 15, 2032 and vest over varying vesting terms through August 2026. The fair value of these option grants was estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: dividend yield of
0 %; expected
volatility of
365.1 %; risk-free interest rate of
2.82 %; and an estimated holding period of 10 years. The Company valued these stock option
at a fair value of $ 7,985,924
and will record stock-based compensation expense over the vesting periods.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, in connection with the accretion of stock-based option expense over the vesting period, the
Company recorded stock option expense of $ 612,173 . As of December 31, 2022, there were
1,901,410,519
options outstanding and
1,380,407,725
options vested, subject to the filing of a registration on Form S-8 for the registration

of unvested stock-based compensation expense to be recognized through August
2026. The aggregate intrinsic value on December 31, 2022 was $ 0

Legal
Action
On
December 10, 2021, YPH LLC filed a complaint against the Company in the District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging
that Theralink breached its Certificate of Designation for Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock by failing to honor a conversion notice
submitted to it by YPH. Based on these and other allegations, Plaintiff asserted a breach of contract claim claiming that it has damages
in excess of $ 100
million. The case continues to be in the pleadings stage with Theralink filing its last response on March 30, 2022.
The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend plaintiffs’ lawsuits vigorously. The Company currently
believes the likelihood of a loss contingency related to these matters is remote and, therefore, no provision for a loss contingency
is required.
On
August 16, 2022, Erika Singleton filed a complaint against the Company in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, Case
No. A-22-857038-C. Plaintiff alleges that the Company did not provide her with physical stock certificates for
200,000
shares of common
stock Plaintiff purchased for $ 2,000
in 2017. Based on these and other allegations, Plaintiff asserts claims against the Company for
breach of contract, violation of Florida securities law, fraud, and unjust enrichment. The court has set the hearing on our motion to
dismiss for
March 23, 2022.
The Plaintiff has until March 2, 2023 to file her opposition to our motion to dismiss and we will
then have until March 16, 2023 to file our reply.

and conditions of that certain Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2022, by and among the Company, certain accredited investors
(the “Second Closing Purchasers”) and Cavalry Fund I Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in its capacity
as Collateral Agent. At the Second Closing, the Company sold the Purchasers (i) New Debentures in an aggregate principal amount
of $ 1,045,000
and (ii) Warrants to purchase up to
298,571,429
shares of Common

100 %
warrant coverage. The Company received a total of $ 950,000
in gross proceeds at the Second Offering, taking
into account the 10% original issue discount, before deducting offering expenses and commissions.
The
Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company, including, among other things and subject

to incur additional indebtedness, and repay outstanding indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, redeem its Common Stock, settle
outstanding litigation, or enter into transactions with affiliates.
Pursuant
to the terms of the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company agreed to (i) pay Gunnar a cash placement fee of 10% of the gross cash

in the Second Offering in an amount equal to 10% of the New Debentures sold to Second Closing Purchasers . As a result of the

The
New Debentures mature on
November
29, 2023 , subject to a three-month extension
at the sole discretion of the Company. The New Debentures bear interest at
10 %
per annum payable upon conversion or maturity. The Debentures are convertible into shares of Common Stock at any time after the maturity
date and prior to Mandatory Conversion (as defined below) at the conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) $ 0.003
per share and (ii)
70%
of the average of the VWAP (as defined in the Debentures) (or 50% of the average of such VWAP if an event of default has occurred and
has not been cured) of the Common Stock during the ten Trading Day (as defined in the New Debentures) period immediately prior to the
applicable conversion date . The New Debentures
are subject to Mandatory Conversion in the event the Company closes a Qualified Offering. The conversion price per share of Common Stock
in the case of a Mandatory Conversion shall be the Qualified Offering Price. Alternatively, upon a Mandatory Conversion, the
holders of the New Debentures may elect to exchange their Debentures for newly issued convertible preferred securities at a price per
share equal to the Qualified Offering Price or the five-day VWAP of the Common Stock prior to the date that is 181 days after the closing
of the Qualified Offering.
Notwithstanding
the preceding, holders of New Debentures shall have the right to require satisfaction of up to 40% of all amounts outstanding under the
New Debentures, in cash, at the time of a Qualified Financing. Investors that are exchanging shareholders shall have the right to require
satisfaction of up to 10% of all amounts outstanding under the Debentures, in cash, at the time of a Qualified Financing.
The New Debentures
also contain certain price protection provisions providing for adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of the Debentures in case of certain future dilutive events or stock-splits and dividends.
The
Company’s obligations under the Purchase Agreement and the New Debentures are secured by a first priority lien on all of the assets
of the Company pursuant to that certain Security Agreement, dated November 29, 2022 (the “Security Agreement”) by and among
the Company, the Purchasers and the Collateral Agent.
In
connection with the issuance of the Underlying Securities discussed above, the Company determined that the terms of the Debentures and
Warrants contain an embedded conversion option to be accounted for as derivative liabilities due to the holder having the potential to
gain value upon conversion and provisions which includes events not within the control of the Company. In accordance with ASC 815-40
- Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity’s Own Stock , the embedded conversion option contained in the Debentures
and the Warrants shall be accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through
earnings at each reporting date. The fair value of the embedded conversion options will be determined using the Binomial Lattice valuation
model. At the end of each period and on Debenture conversion date or repayment, the Company revalues the derivative liabilities resulting
from the embedded option.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This
discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements. The following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
For additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please see Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
“Risk Factors,” and the risk factors included in our September 30, 2022, Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
The
Company is a commercial-stage, precision medicine, molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization
of a series of proprietary data-generating assays that may provide important actionable information for physicians, patients and biopharmaceutical
companies, in the area of oncology. The Company’s objective is to commercialize the technology originally developed by Theranostics
Health, Inc. This technology is differentiated due to:
●
An
exclusive license agreement with George Mason University (“GMU”).
●
A
patent portfolio licensed from GMU and the National Institute of Health (“NIH”).
●
Access
to GMU’s well-published subject matter experts and their pioneering work in phosphoproteomic-based biomarker diagnostics.
●
Expertise
in cancer biomarker and data-generating laboratory testing data.
●
Development
of proprietary, cutting-edge assays focused on precision oncology care.
●
Building
revenue streams based on our proprietary technology.
Theralink
is advancing proprietary technology in the field of phosphoproteomic research, a sector which has emerged as one of the most
exciting new components in the high-growth field of precision molecular diagnostics. This technology is intended to make it possible
to generate an accurate and comprehensive portrait of protein pathway activation in diseased cells from each patient, which may
enable providers to identify and match individuals with optimal targeted molecular therapies. This technology enables the
quantitative measurement of the active protein(s) in cancer cells and their level of activation. We believe the technology’s
measurement sensitivity is many times greater than conventional mass spectrometry and other protein immunoassays. Initially spun-out
from GMU in 2006, and subsequently elevated to the federal government’s Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services’
(“CMS”) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) standards, Theralink’s assay may prove
highly useful for oncology patient management by improving (i) chemotherapy drug selection; (ii) immunotherapy drug selection; and
(iii) optimizing combination therapy selection.
The
biomarker and data-generating tests provide biopharmaceutical companies, clinical scientists and physicians with molecular-based guidance
as to which patients may benefit from new molecular targeted therapeutics being developed for use in treating various life-threatening
oncology diseases. These tests may also provide guidance to physicians on existing treatment standards that are recognized as the standard
of care in the oncology treatment community. This addresses the core aspect of precision oncology treatment by identifying which individuals
are more likely to respond to specific targeted molecular therapies, thus forming the basis for personalized medicine.
The
technology is based upon the pioneering work of three noted scientists, Drs. Lance Liotta, Emanuel Petricoin and Virginia Espina, in
proteomic-based precision medicine. Theralink benefits from a portfolio of intellectual property derived from licensing agreements with:
●
The
US Public Health Service (“PHS”), the federal agency that supervises the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”),
which provides the Company with broad protection around its technology platform; and
●
GMU,
which provides access to additional intellectual property around improvements to the technology platform and biomarker signatures
that form the basis for future phosphoproteomics products.
46
Theralink
is committed to advancing the technology from GMU and the NIH as a platform for the development of new clinical biomarkers. These biomarkers
and monitoring products may have the ability to provide biopharmaceutical companies and doctors with critical molecular-based knowledge
to potentially make the best therapeutic decisions based on a patient’s unique, individual medical needs.
Our
plan of operation over the next 12 months is to:
●
Hiring
additional lab techs and sales consultants;
●
Choosing
members to sit on our Clinical and Scientific Advisory Boards;
●
Continuing
to validate additional Theralink cancer biomarker technology under CAP/CLIA standards for a pan tumor assay to provide personalized
medicine regarding treatment options for biopharmaceutical companies, clinical oncologists and their cancer patients;
●
Continuing
to partner with pharmaceutical companies to perform oncology-related data-generating testing services which may generate additional
revenues and
●
Continuing
to seek financing to grow the Company.

Results
of Operations
Comparison
for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Revenue
●
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated revenues of $55,295 and $78,975, respectively, a decrease of
$23,680, or 30%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in services performed under research and development
contracts for pharmaceutical companies.
Costs
of Revenues
●
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred cost
of revenue of $10,818 and $43,565, respectively, a decrease of $32,747, or 75%. The decrease in the fiscal 2023 period cost of revenue
as a percentage of revenue over the fiscal 2022 period was because in the fiscal 2022 period, the Company was required to purchase expensive
third-party samples for certain pharmaceutical contracts. This increased cost significantly decreased the gross profit for the fiscal
2022 period.
Gross
Margin
●
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, gross profit was
$44,477 and $35,410, respectively, an increase of $9,067, or 26% which represents a gross margin of 80% in the fiscal 2023 period versus
45% in the fiscal 2022 period. The increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue and decrease in cost of revenue discussed
above.

fees:
●
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, professional fees increased by $169,615, or 78%, as compared to the three months ended
December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based consulting fees of $64,946 related to accretion
of stock option expense from the issuance of stock options to consultants in August 2022, an increase in legal fees of $31,073, an
increase in accounting fees of $10,162, an increase in consulting fees of $54,129, and an increase in other professional fees of
$9,305.
Compensation
expense:
●
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, compensation expense increased by $1,126,844, or 180%, as compared to the three months
ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation of $547,227 related to
accretion of stock option expense from the issuance of stock options to employees in August 2022, and an increase in administrative
compensation and related employee benefits and expenses resulting from additional employees being hired and a bonus paid to our CFO.
Licensing
fees:
●
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, licensing fees decreased by $4,455, or 12%, as compared to the three months ended December
31, 2021. Licensing fees are mainly for the lab software, the GMU license and state licenses. During 2022, the Company obtained licenses
from numerous states to conduct business as a certified lab. The expanded national footprint is the driving force behind the fluctuations
in licensing fees.
General
and administrative expenses:
●
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses decreased by $89,163, or 17%, as compared to the three
months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in laboratory and biological supplies expense of approximately
$20,900 due to a decrease in breast cancer research and development, and a decrease in sample analysis services expense of approximately
$113,295 due to the termination of our relationship with our service provider and bringing this function in-house. These decreases
were offset by an increase in samples expense of $25,000 for research and development, an increase in travel expense of $13,979,
and increases in other general and administrative expenses.
Loss
from Operations
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, loss from operations amounted to $2,575,790 as compared to $1,382,016 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,193,774, or 86%. The increase was primarily a result of the increase in operating expenses
discussed above.
Other
Income (Expenses), net
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, total other expenses, net amounted to $33,880,557 and $130,251, respectively, an increase
of $33,750,306. The change was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $1,713,534 resulting from additional debt incurred
in 2023 and an increase in amortization of debt discount, an increase in unrealized loss on market securities of $7,400, an increase
in loss on debt extinguishment of $5,434,447 resulting from the exchange of convertible notes and preferred stock to new debentures on
November 29, 2022, an increase in settlement expense of $200,000, and an increase in derivative expense of $26,397,075 resulting from
the treatment of the new debentures and warrants as derivative liabilities.

Preferred
Stock Dividend and Deemed Dividend
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded dividends for the Series E Preferred stock and Series F Preferred stock in the
amount of $26,301 and $13,151, respectively, for a total of $39,452 of preferred stock dividends.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded dividends for the Series E Preferred stock and Series F Preferred stock in the
amount of $40,329 and $20,164, respectively, for a total of $60,493 of preferred stock dividends.
Net
Loss Attributed to Common Stockholders
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net loss attributed to common stockholders amounted to $36,495,799, or $(0.01) per share (basic
and diluted) compared to net loss attributed to common stockholders of to $1,572,760, or $(0.00) per share (basic and diluted), for the
three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $34,923,039. The increase was a result of the changes in operating expenses and
other expenses, net discussed above.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working capital
deficit of $44,998,742 and $1,130,902 in cash as of December 31, 2022 and a working capital deficit of $2,808,736 and $393,460 in cash

Cash
Requirements
Our
management does not believe that our current capital resources will be adequate to continue operating our Company and maintaining our
business strategy for more than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in the
near future to meet our working capital requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when
needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing
on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business.
Going
Concern
These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the Company
had net loss and net cash used in operations of $36,456,347 and $1,776,349, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit, stockholders’ deficit and working capital deficit of $99,303,616, $44,302,919
and $44,998,742 on December 31, 2022. Management believes that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report.
The
Company cannot provide assurance that it will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional
debt or equity capital. Additionally, the current capital resources are not adequate to continue operating and maintaining the business
strategy for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The Company will seek to raise capital through additional
debt and equity financings to fund its operations in the future.
Although
the Company has historically raised capital from sales of equity and from the issuance of promissory notes, convertible notes and convertible
debentures, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or
secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail or cease operations. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

future dilutive events or stock-splits and dividends.
The Company’s
obligations under the New Related Party Debentures are secured by a first priority lien on all of the assets of the Company pursuant
to the Security Agreement.
The
Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company, including, among other things and subject
to certain exceptions, covenants that restrict the ability of the Company without the prior written consent of the Debenture holders,
to incur additional indebtedness, and repay outstanding indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, redeem its Common Stock, settle

52
On October 22, 2022, the Company issued the “Settlement Note. In
connection with issuance of the Settlement Note, the Company recorded settlement expense of $200,000. On November 29, 2022, the Settlement
Note was exchanged for a new convertible debenture (see below).
On November 29, 2022, the Company consummated the Initial Closing of the
Offering pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, by and among the Company, the Purchasers and the Collateral Agent.
At the Initial Closing, the Company sold the Purchasers the Underlying Securities. The Company received a total of $2,095,288 in net proceeds
at the Initial Offering, net of the Original Issue Discount of $255,000, commissions of $296,800 and other offering costs of $157,912.
The
Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company, including, among other things and subject
to certain exceptions, covenants that restrict the ability of the Company without the prior written consent of the Debenture holders,
to incur additional indebtedness, and repay outstanding indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, redeem its Common Stock, settle
outstanding litigation, or enter into transactions with affiliates.
On November 29, 2022, the Company entered into Securities Exchange Agreements
with the above investors, whereby the Exchanged Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2,675,000 and accrued interest
payable of $173,375 were exchanged for New Debentures. Additionally, on November 29, 2022, in order to induce the investors to exchange
their respective convertible notes into the New Debentures, the aggregate principal amount and accrued interest payable was increased
by 15%, or $427,256, for the New Debentures with an aggregate principal amount of $3,275,631.
On November 29, 2022, the Company entered into Securities Exchange Agreements
with preferred stockholders, whereby holders of 902 shares of Series C-1 preferred stock with a stated value of $372,303, and holders
of 3,037 shares of Series C-2 preferred stock with a stated value of $1,245,935 were exchanged for the New Debentures. Additionally, on
November 29, 2022, in order to induce the preferred stockholders to exchange their respective preferred shares into the New Debentures,
the aggregate stated value of the preferred shares was increased by 15%, or $242,736, for New Debentures with an aggregate principal amount
of $1,860,974.
The New Debentures mature on November 29, 2023, subject to a three-month
extension at the sole discretion of the Company. The New Debentures bear interest at 10% per annum payable upon conversion or maturity.
The New Debentures are convertible into shares of Common Stock at any time after the maturity date and prior to Mandatory Conversion (as
defined below) at the conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) $0.003 per share and (ii) 70% of the average of the VWAP (as defined
in the Debentures) (or 50% of the average of such VWAP if an event of default has occurred and has not been cured) of the Common Stock
during the ten Trading Day (as defined in the Debentures) period immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. The New Debentures
are subject to Mandatory Conversion in the event the Company closes a Qualified Offering. The conversion price per share of Common Stock
in the case of a Mandatory Conversion shall be the Qualified Offering Price. Alternatively, upon a Mandatory Conversion, the holders of
the New Debentures may elect to exchange their Debentures for newly issued convertible preferred securities at a price per share equal
to the Qualified Offering Price or the five-day VWAP of the Common Stock prior to the date that is 181 days after the closing of the Qualified
Offering.
Notwithstanding
the preceding, holders of New Debentures shall have the right to require satisfaction of up to 40% of all amounts outstanding under the
Debentures, in cash, at the time of a Qualified Financing. The New Debentures also contain certain price protection provisions providing
for adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the New Debentures in case of certain future dilutive
events or stock-splits and dividends.
The
Company’s obligations under the New Debentures are secured by a first priority lien on all of the assets of the Company pursuant
to the Security Agreement.
If
the Company or any Subsidiary shall default on any of its obligations under any mortgage credit agreement or other facility indenture
agreement, factoring agreement or other instrument under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any
indebtedness for borrowed money or money due under any long term leasing or factoring arrangement that (a) involves an obligation greater
than $250,000, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, and (b) results in such indebtedness becoming or being
declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise become due and payable, the New Debenture shall be deemed in default
and the default provisions shall apply.
The
Company may hold one or more subsequent closings at any time prior to December 31, 2022, unless otherwise extended, to sell additional
Underlying Securities in an aggregate principal amount up to $6,600,000, which may be adjusted upward to mean an aggregate principal
amount of $8,000,000 upon written consent of the Company and the Placement Agent. The subsequent closing deadline was extended, and a
subsequent raise was consummated on January 27, 2023 (See Note 11 in unaudited notes to financial statements).
53
Note
Payable - Related Party
On May 5, 2022, the Company and Jeffrey Busch amended the Original Note
pursuant to which the principal amount was increased to $350,000 (“New Note”) with the Company receiving additional $250,000
of proceeds and added a conversion feature. The New Note bears an annual interest rate of 1% (which shall increase to 2% in an event of
a default) and matures on May 5, 2024. The New Note may not be prepaid and is only convertible upon an occurrence of a public offering.
The Conversion Amount of the New Note is convertible into shares of common stock at the price for which the common stock was sold in the
public offering. Pursuant to ASC 470-50 -
Debt Modifications and Exchanges;
the amendment was accounted for as a debt extinguishment
because the contingent conversion feature added to the New Note resulted in a substantial modification of the Original Note. No gain or
loss was recognized in connection with the debt extinguishment. As of December 31, 2022, the New Note had an outstanding principal balance
of $350,000, reflected as
notes payable – related party
in the accompanying unaudited balance sheet since the conditions
for its contingent conversion has not yet been met, and accrued interest of $3,356.
Future
Financings
We
will require additional financing to fund our planned operations. We currently do not have committed sources of additional financing
and may not be able to obtain additional financing particularly, if the volatile conditions of the stock and financial markets, and more
particularly the market for early development stage company stocks persist.
There
can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially
reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced
to further delay or further scale down some or all of our activities or perhaps even cease the operations of the business.
Since
inception we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect that we will continue to fund our
operations through equity and debt financing, either alone or through strategic alliances. If we are able to raise additional financing
by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders’ ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial or other loans, assuming
those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
Critical
Accounting Policies
We
have identified the following policies as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted by the
application of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments. These
judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or
annual results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected, and
the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the
following paragraphs.
Use
of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical
experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates during the periods ended December 31, 2022 and
2021 include, but are not necessarily limited to, estimates of contingent liabilities, valuation of marketable securities, useful life
of property and equipment, valuation of ROU assets and lease liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets,
allowances for accounts receivable, estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the fair value of derivatives and the fair
value of non-cash equity transactions.
Additionally,
the full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. However, the Company has made appropriate accounting estimates
based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. To the extent there are material differences between the Company’s
estimates and the actual results, the Company’s future results of operation will be affected.
54
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized,
for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available
to the Company on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the estimates presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative
of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques
based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained
from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
(Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level
1—Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
Level
2—Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level
3—Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
Stock-Based
Compensation
Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 –
“Compensation –Stock Compensation ”,
which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange
for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee
services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures
as they occur as permitted under the FASB’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09
Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment .
Revenue
Recognition
In
accordance with ASU Topic 606 -
Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that
core principle by applying the following steps:
Step
1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Step
3: Determine the transaction price.
Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
Step
5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company provides research and development support to biopharmaceutical
companies to assist their drug development programs. In January 2021, the Company began performing tumor profiling to support clinical
patient therapeutic intervention. The services provided by the Company are performance obligations under services contracts. These contracts
are completed over time and may lead to deferred revenue for services not completed at the end of a period which is reflected as contract
liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. The Company may include, in accounts receivable, amounts billed to customers in advance
of services being initiated or completed. If the Company has a right to such consideration that is unconditional such as for contractually
allowed billings under non-cancellable contracts, such amounts billed in advance would be offset by a contract liability. Management reviews
the completion status of all jobs monthly to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize. The Company offers these services
to biopharmaceutical companies and to private individuals. The Company uses various output methods to recognize revenues. The revenue
recognized from services provided to private individuals during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were minimal and therefore
was not disaggregated for disclosure purposes.
Contract
Liabilities
Contract
liabilities are cash deposits received from customers and advance billing included in accounts receivable on uncompleted contracts for
which revenues have not been recognized as of the balance sheet date.
Leases
The
Company accounts for its leases using the method prescribed by ASC 842 –
Lease Accounting . The Company assess whether the
contract is, or contains, a lease at the inception of a contract which is based on (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct
identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout
the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company allocates the consideration in the
contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. The Company has elected not
to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less.
Operating
and financing lease ROU assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. Operating and financing lease liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As most
leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption
date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.
55
Derivative
Liabilities
The
Company has certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. The Company evaluates all its
financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives
to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10
- Derivative and Hedging - Contract in Entity’s Own Equity .
This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market
at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change
in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective
derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is
reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on debt extinguishment.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect
on the Company’s financial statements.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to our stockholders.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Disclosure controls and procedures include controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed below.
Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation
of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022. Our management’s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
this evaluation, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
The
ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified in
our internal controls over financial reporting:
(1)
The
lack of multiple levels of management review on complex accounting and financial reporting issues, and business transactions,
(2)
a
lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting processing and accounting
functions as a result of our limited financial resources to support the hiring of the necessary personnel and the implementation
of more robust accounting systems,
A
material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis.
56
Management’s
Remediation Plan
We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses,
we plan to implement the following changes in the future:
(i)
appoint
additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and
(ii)
adopt
sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.
The
remediation efforts set out in (i) are largely dependent upon our company securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing
the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended December 31,
2022 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
PART
II – OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On
December 10, 2021, YPH LLC filed a complaint against the Company in the District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging
that Theralink breached its Certificate of Designation for Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock by failing to honor a conversion notice
submitted to it by YPH. Based on these and other allegations, Plaintiff asserted a breach of contract claim claiming that it has damages
in excess of $100 million. The case continues to be in the pleadings stage with Theralink filing its last response on March 30, 2022.
The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend plaintiffs’ lawsuits vigorously. The Company currently
believes the likelihood of a loss contingency related to these matters is remote and, therefore, no provision for a loss contingency
is required.
On August 16, 2022, Erika Singleton filed a complaint against the Company
in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, Case No. A-22-857038-C. Plaintiff alleges that the Company did not provide
her with physical stock certificates for 200,000 shares of common stock Plaintiff purchased for $2,000 in 2017. Based on these and other
allegations, Plaintiff asserts claims against the Company for breach of contract, violation of Florida securities law, fraud, and unjust
enrichment. The court has set the hearing on our motion to dismiss for
March 23, 2022.
The Plaintiff has until March 2, 2023 to
file her opposition to our motion to dismiss and we will then have until March 16, 2023 to file our reply.
