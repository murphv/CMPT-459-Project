INGLES MARKETS, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Three Months Ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021
A. BASIS OF PREPARATION
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as of December 24, 2022 and the results of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows of Ingles Markets, Incorporated, a North Carolina corporation (“Ingles”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), ‎ for the three months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021. The adjustments made are of a normal recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q. It is suggested that these unaudited interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 24, 2022, filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on November 23, 2022.
The results of operations for the three months ended December 24, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.
B. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “ Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting .” The ASU provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform on financial reporting in response to the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). This amendment provides for optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts and hedging relationships that are affected by LIBOR and other reference rates. The ASU generally allows for hedge accounting to continue if the hedge was highly effective or met other standards prior to reference rate reform. Entities are permitted to apply the amendments to all contracts, cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist as of March 12, 2020. The relief provided in this ASU has been extended through December 31, 2024. The Company’s debt agreements and interest rate swaps that utilize LIBOR have not yet discontinued the use of LIBOR and, therefore, this ASU is not yet effective for us. To the extent our debt and interest rate swap arrangements change to another accepted rate within the timeline provided by this ASU, we will utilize the relief in this ASU to continue hedge accounting.
C. SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS
From time to time, the Company purchases financial products that can be readily converted into cash, and the Company accounts for such financial products as short-term investments.
The financial products include money market funds, bonds and mutual funds.
The carrying values of the Company’s short-term investments approximate fair value because of their liquidity.
D. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
Receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 382,683
at December 24, 2022 and $ 382,657
at September 24, 2022.
E. INCOME TAXES
The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state income taxes and tax credits.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits and could incur interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. These amounts are insignificant and are not expected to significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

F. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND CURRENT PORTION OF OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES

$
94,969,902
Self-insurance liabilities are established for general liability claims, workers’ compensation, and employee group medical and dental benefits based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The Company is currently insured for covered costs in excess of $ 1.0
million per occurrence for workers’ compensation and for general liability and $ 475,000
per covered person for medical care benefits for a policy year. The Company’s self-insurance reserves totaled $ 31.1
million at December 24, 2022. Of this amount, $ 12.9
million is accounted for as a current liability and $ 18.2
million as a long-term liability, which is inclusive of $ 4.1
million of expected self-insurance recoveries from excess cost insurance or other sources that are recorded as a receivable. At September 24, 2022, the Company’s self-insurance reserves totaled $ 31.0
million of which $ 13.2
million was accounted for as a current liability and $ 17.8
million as a long-term liability, which is inclusive of $ 4.0
million of expected self-insurance recoveries from excess cost insurance or other sources that are recorded as a receivable.
Employee insurance expense, including workers’ compensation and medical care benefits, net of employee contributions, totaled $ 10.8
million and $ 13.4
million for the three months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively.
The Company’s fuel operations use underground tanks for the storage of gasoline and diesel fuel. The Company reviewed FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 410 (“FASB ASC 410”) and determined we have a legal obligation to remove tanks at various points in the future and accordingly determined we have met the requirements of an asset retirement obligation. The Company followed the FASB ASC 410 model for determining the asset retirement cost and asset retirement obligation. The amounts recorded were immaterial for each fuel center as well as in the aggregate, at December 24, 2022 and September 24, 2022.
G. LONG-TERM DEBT
In June 2021, the Company issued at par $ 350.0
million aggregate principal amount of
4.00 % senior notes due
2031
(the “Notes”).
The Company may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at any time at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount), if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning June 15 of the years indicated below:
Year
2026 102.000 % 2027 101.333 % 2028 100.667 % 2029 and thereafter 100.000 %
The Company has a $ 150.0
million line of credit (the “Line”) that matures in
June 2026 . The Line provides the Company with various interest rate options based on the prime rate, the Federal Funds Rate, or LIBOR. The Line allows the Company to issue up to $ 10.0
million in letters of credit, of which
none
were issued at December 24, 2022. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances in connection with the Line.
At December 24, 2022, the Company had
no
borrowings outstanding under the Line.
In December 2010, the Company completed the funding of $ 99.7
million of bonds (the
“ Bonds”) for construction of new warehouse and distribution space adjacent to its existing space in Buncombe County, North Carolina (the “Project”). The final maturity date of the Bonds is
January 1, 2036 .
Under a Continuing Covenant and Collateral Agency Agreement (the “Covenant Agreement”) between certain financial institutions and the Company, the financial institutions would hold the Bonds until December 2029, subject to certain events. Mandatory redemption of the Bonds by the Company in the annual amount of $ 4.5
million began on
January 1, 2014 . The outstanding balance of the Bonds was $ 59.0
million as of December 24, 2022. The Company may redeem the Bonds without penalty or premium at any time prior to
December 17, 2029 . The Covenant Agreement was amended during the quarter ended December 25, 2021 to extend the holding period from September 2026 to December 2029 and reduce the interest rate on the Bonds.
Interest earned by bondholders on the Bonds is exempt from Federal and North Carolina income taxation.
The interest rate on the Bonds is equal to one-month LIBOR (adjusted monthly) plus a credit spread, adjusted to reflect the income tax exemption.
8
The Company’s obligation to repay the Bonds is collateralized by the Project. The Covenant Agreement incorporates substantially all financial covenants included in the Line.
In September 2017, the Company refinanced approximately $ 60
million of secured borrowing obligations with a LIBOR-based amortizing floating rate loan secured by real estate, which matures in October 2027. The Company has an interest rate swap agreement for a current notional amount of $ 29.0
million at a fixed rate of
3.92 %. Under this agreement, the Company pays monthly the fixed rate of
3.92 % and receives the one-month LIBOR plus
1.65 %. The interest rate swap effectively hedges floating rate debt in the same amount as the current notional amount of the interest swap. Both the floating rate debt and the interest rate swap have monthly principal amortization of $ 0.5
million and mature
October 1, 2027 .
In December 2019, the Company closed a $ 155
million LIBOR-based amortizing floating rate loan secured by real estate, which matures in
January 2030 . The Company has an interest rate swap agreement for a current notional amount of $ 130.5
million at a fixed rate of
2.95 %. Under this agreement, the Company pays monthly the fixed rate of
2.95 % and receives the one-month LIBOR plus
1.50 %. The interest rate swap effectively hedges floating rate debt in the same amount as the current notional amount of the interest swap. Both the floating rate debt and the interest rate swap have monthly principal amortization of $ 0.65
million and mature in fiscal year 2030.
The Company recognizes differences between the variable rate interest payments and the fixed interest rate settlements with the swap counterparties as an adjustment to interest expense each period over the life of the swaps. The Company has designated the swaps as cash flow hedges and records the changes in the estimated fair value of the swaps to other comprehensive income each period. For the three months ended December 24, 2022, the Company recorded $ 1.2
million of other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Unrealized gains of $ 14.9
million are included as an asset at fair value in the line “Other Assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
as of December 24, 2022. For the three-month period ended December 25, 2021, the Company recorded $ 1.4
million of other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
The Company’s long-term debt agreements generally contain provisions that under certain circumstances would permit lending institutions to terminate or withdraw their respective extensions of credit to the Company. Included among the triggering factors permitting the termination or withdrawal of the Line to the Company are certain events of default, including both monetary and non-monetary defaults, the initiation of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, and the failure of the Company to meet certain financial covenants designated in its respective loan documents. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants at December 24, 2022.
The Company’s long-term debt agreements generally have cross-default provisions which could result in the acceleration of payments due under all long-term debt agreements in the event of default under any one instrument.
At December 24, 2022, property and equipment with an undepreciated cost of approximately $ 260.0
million were pledged as collateral for long-term debt. Long-term debt and Line agreements contain various restrictive covenants requiring, among other things, minimum levels of net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios. At December 24, 2022, the Company had excess net worth totaling $ 406.1
million calculated under covenants in the Bonds, various floating rate loans (the “Loans”), and the Line.
This amount is available to pay dividends; however, certain loan agreements containing provisions outlining minimum tangible net worth requirements restrict the ability of the Company to pay cash dividends in excess of the current annual per share dividends paid on the Company’s Class A and Class B Common Stock. Further, the Company is prevented from paying cash dividends at any time that it is in default under the indenture governing the Notes. In addition, the terms of the indenture may restrict the ability of the Company to pay additional cash dividends based on certain financial parameters.
H. DIVIDENDS
The Company paid cash dividends of $ 0.165
for each share of Class A Common Stock and $ 0.15
for each share of Class B Common Stock on
October 13, 2022
to stockholders of record on
October 6, 2022 .
For additional information regarding the dividend rights of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, please see Note 8, “Stockholders’ Equity” to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on November 23, 2022.
I. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
The Company has
two
classes of common stock:
Class A Common Stock which is publicly traded, and Class B Common Stock, which has no public market. The Class B Common Stock has restrictions on transfer; however,
each share is convertible into one share of Class A Common Stock at any time .
Each share of Class A Common Stock has
one
vote per share and each share of Class B Common Stock has
ten
votes per share . Each share of Class A Common Stock is entitled to receive cash dividends equal to
110 % of any cash dividend paid on Class B Common Stock.
9
The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260.
The two-class method of computing basic earnings per share for each period reflects the cash dividends declared per share for each class of stock, plus allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock. Diluted earnings per share is calculated assuming the conversion of all shares of Class B Common Stock to shares of Class A Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. The tables below reconcile the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per share for current and prior periods.

J. LEASES
Leases as Lessee
The Company conducts part of its retail operations from leased facilities. The initial terms of the leases are generally
20
years. The majority of the leases include one or more renewal options and require that the Company pay property taxes, utilities, repairs and certain other costs incidental to occupation of the premises. Several leases contain clauses that require rental payments based on a percentage of gross sales of the supermarket occupying the leased space.
Step rent provisions, escalation clauses and lease incentives are taken into account in computing minimum lease payments.
Operating lease cost for all operating leases totaled $ 2.6
million for the three months ended December 24, 2022. This amount included short-term (less than one year) leases, common area expenses, and variable lease costs, all of which are insignificant. Cash paid for lease liabilities in operating activities approximates operating lease cost.
Maturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 24, 2022 were as follows:

L. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of the Company’s debt and interest rate swaps are estimated using valuation techniques under the accounting guidance related to fair value measurements based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect readily available data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions.
These inputs are classified into the following hierarchy:
Level 1 Inputs
– Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs
– Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 Inputs
– Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities.
The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.
The carrying amount and fair value of the Company’s debt, interest rate swaps, and non-qualified retirement plan assets at December 24, 2022 were as follows (in thousands):

M. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business are pending against the Company.
In the opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any, from all pending legal proceedings and claims is not expected to materially affect the Company’s financial position, the results of its operations, or its cash flows.
N. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company will from time to time make short-term non-interest bearing loans to the Company’s Investment/Profit Sharing Plan to allow the plan to meet distribution obligations during a time when the plan was prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. During the three months ended December 24, 2022, there were
no
such loans made, repaid or outstanding.
During the three months ended December 24, 2022, a limited liability corporation having Robert P. Ingle II, the Company’s Chairman of the Board, as one of its principals, purchased a shopping center, from an unrelated party at which the Company has a long-term lease in place. The Company’s lease was in place prior to such purchase, and the terms of the lease have not changed since it was originally negotiated.
Item 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Ingles, a leading supermarket chain in the Southeast, operates 198 supermarkets in North Carolina (75), Georgia (65), South Carolina (35), Tennessee (21), Virginia (1) and Alabama (1). Ingles supermarkets offer customers a wide variety of nationally advertised food products, including grocery, meat and dairy products, produce, frozen foods and other perishables and non-food products. Non-food products include fuel centers, pharmacies, health/beauty/cosmetic products and general merchandise, as well as quality private label items. In addition, the Company focuses on selling products to its customers through the development of certified organic products, bakery departments and prepared foods including delicatessen sections.
12
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic which began in March 2020 and has continued through the three months ended December 24, 2022, has impacted supermarket operations. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented several enhanced cleaning and social distancing protocols designed to keep our customers and our associates safe and has continued to monitor and update its protocols as the pandemic has evolved. Since March 2020, the Company’s stores have experienced increased customer traffic and occasional product shortages due to supply chain issues. Recently, an extremely tight labor market has impacted the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified store personnel, but these impacts have not materially affected our operations.
Finally, as the economy recovers, inflation has reached levels not seen in decades. Inflation impacts product costs, labor costs and other goods used by the Company.
At the present time, we do not know how long and to what extent the ongoing effects of the pandemic and inflation could impact our sales and financial performance.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management estimates, by their nature, involve judgments regarding future uncertainties, and actual results may therefore differ materially from these estimates.   Self-Insurance
The Company is self-insured for workers’ compensation and group medical and dental benefits. Risks and uncertainties are associated with self-insurance; however, the Company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverage of $1.0 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation and for general liability, and $475,000 per covered person for medical care benefits for a policy year. Self-insurance liabilities are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators. These estimates can fluctuate if historical trends are not predictive of the future. The majority of the Company’s properties are self-insured for casualty losses and business interruption; however, liability coverage is maintained.
At December 24, 2022 the Company’s self-insurance reserves totaled $31.1 million. This amount is inclusive of $4.1 million of expected self-insurance recoveries from excess cost insurance or other sources that are recorded as a receivable.
Asset Impairments
The Company accounts for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360. For assets to be held and used, the Company tests for impairment using undiscounted cash flows and calculates the amount of impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets held for sale, impairment is recognized based on the excess of remaining book value over expected recovery value. The recovery value is the fair value as determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal associates. Estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the Company’s experience and knowledge of local operations and cash flows that are projected for several years into the future. These estimates can fluctuate significantly due to changes in real estate market conditions, the economic environment, capital spending decisions and inflation. The Company monitors the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether any indicators of impairment have occurred.
There were no asset impairments during the three-month period ended December 24, 2022.
Vendor Allowances
The Company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities from the many vendors whose products the Company buys for resale in its stores. These incentives and allowances are primarily composed of volume or purchase based incentives, advertising allowances, slotting fees, and promotional discounts. The purpose of these incentives and allowances is generally to help defray the costs incurred by the Company for stocking, advertising, promoting and selling the applicable vendor’s products. These allowances generally relate to short term arrangements with vendors, often relating to a period of a month or less, and are negotiated on a purchase-by-purchase or transaction-by-transaction basis. Whenever practical, vendor discounts and allowances that relate to buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold. Due to the use of the retail method of store inventory and the nature of certain allowances, it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory. In those instances, the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs using a rational and systematic methodology, which results in the recognition of these incentives when the inventory related to the vendor consideration received is sold. Vendor allowances applied as a reduction of merchandise costs totaled $34.4 million and $31.9 million for the fiscal quarters ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Vendor advertising allowances that represent a reimbursement of specific identifiable incremental costs of advertising the vendor’s specific products are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period in which the related expense is incurred. Vendor advertising allowances recorded as a
13
reduction of advertising expense totaled $2.0 million and $2.1 million for the fiscal quarters ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Overall, v endor allowances decreased significantly at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as vendors reduced support for promotional activities. Vendor promotional support subsequently increased, but has not reached pre-pandemic levels.
If vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated, the Company would likely consider other methods of advertising, as well as the volume and frequency of the Company’s product advertising, which could increase or decrease the Company’s expenditures.
Similarly, the Company is not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenue, as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for the Company’s stores.
Results of Operations
Ingles operates on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in September.
The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three-month periods ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 both include 13 weeks of operations. Comparable store sales are defined as sales by retail stores in operation for five full fiscal quarters. Sales from replacement stores, major remodels and the addition of fuel stations to existing stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation from the date thereof. A replacement store is a newly-opened store that replaces an existing nearby store that has closed. A major remodel entails substantial remodeling of an existing store and includes additional retail square footage. For the three-month period ended December 24, 2022, comparable store sales included 197 stores.
For the three-month period ended December 25, 2021, comparable store sales included 196 stores.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, selected financial information as a percentage of net sales.

December 25, 2021
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $69.4 million, compared with net income of $66.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Retail grocery sales increased due to continued consumer trends seen since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effects of inflation. Corresponding operating expenses did not increase as much as sales, resulting in higher pre-tax income.
Net Sales.
Net sales increased by $101.8 million, or 7.3%, to $1.5 billion for the three months ended December 24, 2022 compared with $1.4 billion for the three months ended December 25, 2021.
Excluding fuel sales, total grocery comparable store sales increased 7.3% over the comparative fiscal quarter. Ingles operated 198 stores at both December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021.
Inflation in the prices of food and fuel has also positively impacted the dollar amount of sales.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 24.9% and 25.2% for the three months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from inflation and raw material shortages, which have increased the cost of products.
Retail segment gross profit, excluding fuel decreased 84 basis points for the quarter ended December 24, 2022, as compared with the quarter ended December 25, 2021.

Operating and Administrative Expenses.
Operating and administrative expenses increased $16.1 million, or 6.2%, to $276.2 million for the three months ended December 24, 2022, as compared to $260.1 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021. As a percentage of sales, operating and administrative expenses were 18.5% and 18.7% for the December 2022 and December 2021 quarters, respectively. Excluding fuel sales and associated fuel operating expenses (primarily payroll), operating expenses were 21.0% of sales for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with 21.5% for the first fiscal quarter of 2022.

Bank charges increased due to increased sales and a greater portion of sales settled with credit/debit cards instead of cash or check.
Other Income.
Other income totaled $1.4 million for the three months ended December 24, 2022 compared with $1.6 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021.

Interest expense
totaled $5.3 million for the three-month period ended December 24, 2022 compared with $5.4 million for the
three-month period ended December 25, 2021. Total debt at December 24, 2022 was $564.5 million compared with $586.1 million at December 25, 2021.
Income Taxes.
Income tax expense totaled $22.5 million for the three months ended December 24, 2022, reflecting an effective tax rate of 24.5% of pretax income. Income tax expense totaled $20.4 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.6% of pretax income.
Net Income.
Net income totaled $69.4 million for the three-month period ended December 24, 2022 compared with $66.2 million for the three-month period ended December 25, 2021. Basic and diluted earnings per share for Class A Common Stock were $3.73 and $3.65, respectively, for the December 2022 quarter, compared to $3.57 and $3.48, respectively, for the December 2021 quarter. Basic and diluted earnings per share for Class B Common Stock were each $3.40 for the December 2022 quarter compared with $3.24 for the December 2021 quarter.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures totaled $59.3 million for the three-month period ended December 24, 2022. The Company’s capital expenditures include the construction of new stores, the expansion and remodeling of existing stores, the acquisition of sites, new technology, and upgrades of the Company’s transportation fleet and facilities.
The Company’s capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2023 currently include investments of approximately $120 to $140 million. At this time the Company does not anticipate that the continually evolving COVID-19 environment will have an adverse impact on its long-term capital expenditure plans. The Company currently plans to dedicate the majority of its fiscal 2023 capital expenditures to continued improvement of its store base and continued investment in one store expected to open in fiscal 2023, as well as technology improvements, upgrading and replacing existing store, warehouse and transportation equipment and improvements to the Company’s milk processing plant.
The Company currently expects that its annual capital expenditures will be in the range of approximately $100 to $160 million going forward in order to maintain a modern store base. Among other things, planned expenditures for any given future fiscal year will be
15
affected by the availability of financing, which can affect both the number of projects pursued at any given time and the cost of those projects. The number of projects may also fluctuate due to the varying costs of the types of projects pursued including new stores and major remodel/expansions. The Company makes decisions on the allocation of capital expenditure dollars based on many factors including the competitive environment, other Company capital initiatives and its financial condition.
The Company does not generally enter into commitments for capital expenditures other than on a store-by-store basis at the time it begins construction on a new store or begins a major or minor remodeling project.
Liquidity
The Company generated $57.3 million net cash from operations for the December 2022 three-month period compared with $95.0 million for the December 2021 three-month period.
The decrease was primarily attributable to higher working capital needs .
Cash used by investing activities for the three-month periods ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 totaled $58.2 million and $131.1 million, respectively. Excess cash of approximately $110 million was invested in short-term financial instruments in the prior year offset by higher capital expenditures through the first quarter of fiscal 2023.   Cash used by financing activities totaled $10.7 million for the three-month period ended December 24, 2022, compared with $6.5 million for the three-month period ended December 25, 2021.
During the quarter ended December 24, 2022, the Company repaid $4.2 million of mortgage debt.
In June 2021, the Company issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2031 (the “Notes”). The
Notes bear an interest rate of 4.00% per annum and were issued at par.
The Company has a $150.0 million line of credit (the “Line”) that matures in June 2026.
The Line provides the Company with various interest rate options based on the prime rate, the Federal Funds Rate, or LIBOR. The Line allows the Company to issue up to $10.0 million in letters of credit, of which none were issued at December 24, 2022. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances in connection with the Line. At December 24, 2022, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Line.
In December 2010, the Company completed the funding of $99.7 million of Bonds (the “Bonds”) for the construction of new warehouse and distribution space adjacent to its existing space in Buncombe County, North Carolina (the “Project”). The final maturity date of the Bonds is January 1, 2036.
Under a Continuing Covenant and Collateral Agency Agreement (the “Covenant Agreement”) between certain financial institutions and the Company, the financial institutions would hold the Bonds until December 17, 2029, subject to certain events. Mandatory redemption of the Bonds by the Company in the annual amount of $4.5 million began on January 1, 2014. The outstanding balance of the Bonds is $59.0 million as of December 24, 2022. The Company may redeem the Bonds without penalty or premium at any time prior to December 17, 2029.
The Covenant Agreement was amended during the three months ended December 25, 2021 to extend the holding period from September 2026 to December 2029 and reduce the interest rate on the Bonds.
In September 2017, the Company refinanced approximately $60 million secured borrowing obligations with a LIBOR-based amortizing floating rate loan secured by real estate maturing in October 2027. The Company has an interest rate swap agreement for a current notional amount of $29.0 million at a fixed rate of 3.92%. Under this agreement, the Company pays monthly the fixed rate of 3.92% and receives the one-month LIBOR plus 1.65%. The interest rate swap effectively hedges floating rate debt in the same amount as the current notional amount of the interest rate swap. Both the floating rate debt and the interest rate swap have monthly principal amortization of $0.5 million and mature October 1, 2027.
In December 2019, the Company closed a $155 million LIBOR-based amortizing floating rate loan secured by real estate maturing in January 2030. The Company has an interest rate swap agreement for a current notional amount of $130.5 million at a fixed rate of 2.95%. Under this agreement, the Company pays monthly the fixed rate of 2.95% and receives the one-month LIBOR plus 1.50%.
The interest rate swap effectively hedges floating rate debt in the same amount as the current notional amount of the interest swap.
Both the floating rate debt and the interest rate swap have monthly principal amortization of $0.65 million and mature in fiscal year 2030.
The fair market value of the interest rate swaps are measured quarterly with adjustments recorded in other comprehensive income.
The Company’s long-term debt agreements generally have cross-default provisions which could result in the acceleration of payments due under the Company’s Line, Bonds and Notes indenture in the event of default under any one instrument.
The Company’s long-term debt agreements generally contain provisions that under certain circumstances would permit lending institutions to terminate or withdraw their respective extensions of credit to the Company. Included among the triggering factors permitting the termination or withdrawal of the Line to the Company are certain events of default, including both monetary and non-monetary defaults, the initiation of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, and the failure of the Company to meet certain financial covenants designated in its respective loan documents. As of December 24, 2022, the Company was in compliance with these
16
covenants. Under the most restrictive of these covenants, the Company would have been permitted to incur approximately $2.3 billion of additional borrowings (including borrowings under the Line) as of December 24, 2022.
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flow from operations, borrowings under the Line and long-term debt financing. The Company believes, based on its current results of operations and financial condition, that its financial resources, including the Line, short- and long-term financing expected to be available to it and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future, including any debt service requirements of additional borrowings. However, there is no assurance that any such sources of financing will be available to the Company when needed on acceptable terms, or at all.
It is possible that, in the future, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition will be different from that described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q based on a number of factors. These factors may include, among others, increased competition, changing regional and national economic conditions, adverse climatic conditions affecting food production and delivery, changing demographics, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the additional factors discussed below under “Forward Looking Statements.” It is also possible, for such reasons, that the results of operations from the new, expanded, remodeled and/or replacement stores will not meet or exceed the results of operations from existing stores that are described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Quarterly Cash Dividends
Since December 27, 1993, the Company has paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.165 (sixteen and one-half cents) per share on its Class A Common Stock and $0.15 (fifteen cents) per share on its Class B Common Stock for an annual rate of $0.66 and $0.60 per share, respectively.
The Company expects to continue paying regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, the Board of Directors periodically reconsiders the declaration of dividends. The Company pays these dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors and the continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depends upon the results of operations, the financial condition of the Company and other factors which the Board of Directors deems relevant.
In addition, the Notes, the Bonds, the Line, and other debt agreements contain provisions that, based on certain financial parameters, restrict the ability of the Company to pay additional cash dividends in excess of current quarterly per share amounts. Further, the Company is prevented from declaring dividends at any time that it is in default under the indenture governing the Notes.
Seasonality
Grocery sales are subject to a slight seasonal variance due to both holiday related sales and sales in areas where seasonal homes are located.
Sales are traditionally higher in the Company’s first fiscal quarter due to the inclusion of sales related to Thanksgiving and Christmas. Unless Easter falls within the quarter, the Company’s second fiscal quarter traditionally has the lowest sales of the year predominantly due to lower occupancy of seasonal homes. In the third and fourth quarters, sales are usually positively affected by the return of customers to seasonal homes in our market area.
Impact of Inflation
As the economy continues to recover from the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation has recently reached levels not experienced in decades. Food and energy costs have increased, reflecting a tight labor market and supply chain/transportation disruptions.
The following table from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics lists annualized changes in the Consumer Price Index that could have an effect on the Company’s operations.
One of the Company’s significant costs is labor, which increases with general inflation.
Inflation or deflation in energy costs affects the Company’s fuel sales, distribution expenses and plastic supply costs.
During the past twelve months, inflation has reached its highest level in a number of years, impacting food costs, transportation costs, and labor costs.

Forward Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “likely”, “goal”, “believe”, “seek”, “will”, “may”, “would”, “should” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. While these forward-looking statements and the related assumptions are made in good faith and reflect the Company’s current judgment regarding the direction of
17
the Company’s business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested
or described by such forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates which are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Some of these assumptions inevitably will not materialize, and unanticipated events will occur which will affect the Company’s results. Some important factors (but not necessarily all factors) that affect the Company’s revenues, financial position, growth strategies, profitability and operating results, or that otherwise could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statement, include the potential continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and economic conditions generally in the Company’s operating area; the Company’s ability to successfully implement its expansion and operating strategies and to manage rapid expansion; pricing pressures and other competitive factors; reduction in per gallon retail fuel prices; the maturation of new and expanded stores; the Company’s ability to reduce costs and achieve improvements in operating results; the availability and terms of financing; increases in labor and utility costs; success or failure in the ownership and development of real estate; changes in the laws and government regulations applicable to the Company; disruptions in the efficient distribution of food products; changes in accounting policies, standards, guidelines or principles as may be adopted by regulatory agencies as well as the Financial Accounting Standards Board; and those factors contained under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended September 24, 2022, filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on November 23, 2022 .
Consequently, actual events affecting the Company and the impact of such events on the Company’s operations may vary significantly from those described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or contemplated or implied by statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company does not undertake and specifically denies any obligation to update any such statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any such statements to reflect future events or developments, except to the extent required by applicable law.
Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As disclosed under “Liquidity” in Part I Item 2 of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company is a party to interest rate swap agreements for a current aggregate notional amount of $159.5 million.
Otherwise, the Company does not typically utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it typically utilize leveraged financial instruments. There have been no other material changes in the market risk factors from those disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 24,
2022, filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on November 23,
2022.
Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objective that information in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, include controls and procedures designed to ensure the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the Company’s system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.
As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 24, 2022, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In making this evaluation, it considered matters previously identified and disclosed in connection with the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022. After consideration of the matters discussed above and the changes in internal control over financial reporting discussed below, the Company has concluded that its controls and procedures were effective as of December 24, 2022.
(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company is currently planning and performing tests of internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal year 2023.
No changes in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the Company’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
