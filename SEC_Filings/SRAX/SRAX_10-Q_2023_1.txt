NOTE
1 –
ORGANIZATION AND LIQUIDITY
Organization
SRAX,
Inc. (“SRAX”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation
formed on August 2, 2011. SRAX is headquartered in Westlake Village, California but operates as a distributed virtual Company. As of
March 31, 2022, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements consist of SRAX and its wholly owned subsidiary LD Micro, Inc.
(“LD Micro”).
SRAX
is a technology firm focused on enhancing communications between public companies and their shareholders and investors. The Company currently
has one reportable and operating segment, which consists of one reporting unit consisting of two distinct business units:
● The
unique SaaS platform, Sequire provides users many features which allow issuers to track their
shareholders’ behaviors and trends, then use data-driven insights to engage with shareholders
across marketing channels.
● Through
LD Micro, the Company organizes and hosts investor conferences within the micro and small-
cap markets, and plans to create several more niche events for the investor community.
Each
of SRAX’s business units deliver valuable insights that assist the Company’s clients with their investor relations and communications
initiatives.
On
February 4, 2021, the Company acquired FPVD through a reverse acquisition involving BIGtoken, Inc. On December 29, 2021, the Company
deconsolidated the Company’s majority owned subsidiary BIG Token, Inc. (“BIGToken”) formerly known as Force
Protection Video Equipment Corporation (or “FPVD”). See Note 3 –Discontinued Operations.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate cash in excess of its operating
expenses for a sustained period of time. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 351,000
which is not sufficient
to fund the Company’s planned operations through one year after the date the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
are issued. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one
year after the date that the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are issued.
The
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable
to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a basis
that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
In
making this assessment, the Company performed a comprehensive analysis of current circumstances including: its financial position, cash
flow and cash usage forecasts, and obligations and debts. Although management has a long history of successful capital raises, the analysis
used to determine the Company’s ability as a going concern does not include cash sources outside the Company’s direct control
that management expects to be available within the next 12 months.
The
Company expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and marketable securities as of March 31, 2022, will
not be sufficient to enable it to fund the anticipated level of operations through one year from the date these financial statements
are issued.
The Company projects the sale of its marketable security holding will represent a substantial portion of the cash required for operations for the foreseeable future. The Company’s sales of marketable securities are primarily through sale transactions that qualify for exemptions pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. The conditions required to be met to qualify for the exemptions under Rule 144 are often difficult to predict, making it difficult to predict the timing of the associated cash flows from the sales of these securities. The Company’s holdings of marketable securities are subject to risks and uncertainties such as fluctuations in pricing in the primary market, and legal restrictions that create uncertainty around realization and timing of cash flows.
The Company anticipates raising additional capital through the private and public sales of its equity or debt securities
and selling its marketable securities, or a combination thereof. Although management believes that such capital sources will be available,
there can be no assurances that financing will be available when needed in order to allow the Company to continue its operations, or
if available, on terms acceptable to it. If the Company does not raise sufficient capital in a timely manner, among other things, it
may be forced to scale back its operations or cease operations altogether.
Uncertainty
Due to Geopolitical Events
Due
to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, and the resulting sanctions and other actions against
Russia and Belarus, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy. Although the Russian war against
Ukraine did not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s revenue or other financial results for the three months
ended March 31, 2022, at this time the Company is unable to fully assess the aggregate impact the Russian war
against Ukraine will have on its business due to various uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, the
duration of the war, the war’s effect on the economy, its impact to the businesses of the Company’s customers, and
actions that may be taken by governmental authorities related to the war.
COVID-19
Update
The
continuing COVID-19 global pandemic has caused significant disruption to the economy and financial markets globally, and the full extent
of the potential impacts of COVID-19 are not yet known. Circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are complex, and uncertain. The
impact of COVID-19 has not been significant to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital
resources. Although no material impairment or other effects have been identified to date, there is substantial uncertainty in the nature
and degree of its continued effects over time. That uncertainty affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which
could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions as additional events and information
become known. The Company will continue to consider the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business operations.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto are unaudited. The unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information
and note disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The December
31, 2021 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by
GAAP. These interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the opinion of management, reflect all normal recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim three-month
periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022 or for any future period.
These
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial
Statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Estimates
The
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and require management of the Company
to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The
most significant areas that require management judgment and which are susceptible to possible change in the near term include, among
other items, the Company’s revenue recognition, valuation of marketable investment securities, stock-based compensation, income
taxes, purchase price for acquisitions, goodwill, other intangible assets, and the valuation of redemption features and other assets
and liabilities.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair
value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the Company’s principal or, in absence of a principal,
most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability.
In
determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation techniques. A fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value.
It maximizes observable inputs and minimizes unobservable inputs. Valuation techniques consistent with the market or income approach
are used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels:
● Level
1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the Company has the ability to access;
● Level
2 - Valuations based on inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable
either directly or indirectly; and
● Level
3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair
value measurement.
Fair
value is a market-based measure that is based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant
on the measurement date.
The
availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and are affected by a wide variety
of factors. The determination of fair value requires prudent judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated values
may be materially different from values were a ready market available. Inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels
of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the item being valued is classified based on the hierarchy category of the lowest significant
level input to the fair value measurement. See Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
10
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates its fair value. The Company maintains its
cash and cash equivalents in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in accounts that at times
may be in excess of the federally insured limit of $ 250,000
per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with
major financial institutions. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 101,000
and $ 1,098,000
in excess of the federal
insurance limit, respectively.
Marketable
Securities
Marketable
Securities consist of debt and equity securities. The Company accounts for marketable equity securities, including convertible preferred
shares at fair value pursuant to ASC 321 Investments – Equity Securities, and marketable debt securities at fair value in accordance
with ASC 320 – Investments Debt Securities. Marketable securities were approximately $ 28.8
million and $ 15.6
million as of March
31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Accounts
Receivable
Credit
is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors, and the Company usually does not require
collateral. Management periodically assesses the Company’s accounts receivable and, if necessary, establishes an allowance for
estimated uncollectible amounts. Accounts determined to be uncollectible are charged to operations when that determination is made. The
allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $ 157,000
and $ 130,000
as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Concentration
of Credit and Significant Customer Risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions within the United States. The balances maintained at these financial
institutions are generally more than the FDIC insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any loss on these accounts.
As
of March 31, 2022, the Company had 2 customers with an accounts receivable balance of approximately
43 %. As of December 31, 2021, the
Company had one customer with an accounts receivable balance of approximately
11 %. Additionally, included within accounts receivables,
the Company has a receivable of approximately $ 350,000
as of March 31, 2022 due from a prior subsidiary.
For
the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no customers that account for a significant percentage of total revenues.
Goodwill
and Intangible assets
Intangible
assets consist of (i) goodwill, intellectual property, trademarks, trade names and non-compete agreements acquired in business combinations
and capitalized software development costs. Other than goodwill and trademarks, intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization. Amortization is provided for on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets of five years.
Impairment
of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-lived Assets
Management
evaluates the recoverability of the Company’s definitive lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances
indicate a potential impairment exists. Events and circumstances considered by the Company in determining whether the carrying value
of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to: significant changes
in performance relative to expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or
economic trends; a significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period of time; and changes in the Company’s
business strategy. In determining if impairment exists, the Company estimates the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use
and ultimate disposition of these assets. If impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets’ carrying values and the
undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value
of the assets.
Management
evaluates the recoverability of the Company’s goodwill annually at December 31 or more often as events or circumstances indicate
the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. The Company has determined that it operates as a single reporting unit for
the purposes of conducting this goodwill impairment assessment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value,
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying
value.
No
impairments of goodwill or other long-lived assets have been recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2022 or 2021.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenues upon the satisfaction of its performance obligation(s) (upon transfer of control of promised goods or services
to its customers) in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the five-step process as follows:
1) identification
of contracts with customers;
2) identification
of the distinct performance obligations in the contract;
3) determination
of the transaction price of the contract;
4) allocation
of transaction price among the performance obligations in the contract; and
5) recognition
of revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.
11
The
Company has elected the following practical expedients allowed in accounting for its revenue recognition:
● not
adjusting contract consideration for the effects of significant financing components if the
period between transfer or service and customer payment is expected to be less than one year;
● not
assessing performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract;
● excluding
sales and similar taxes from the transaction price; and
● not
disclosing the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original
expected length of one year or less.
The
Company generates revenue primarily from its Sequire SaaS platform and its LD Micro subsidiary. Specifically, the Sequire SaaS platform
related revenue consists of (i) licensing subscriptions to access the platform, (ii) managed services involving data and marketing initiatives
and (iii) ancillary data supplementing the use of the platform. LD Micro revenues consist of attendee fees and event sponsorship fees
related investor conferences organized and hosted by the Company.
Sequire
SaaS platform
Sequire
SaaS platform agreements are typically for a period of 12-months and provide for monthly or annual payments in advance.
Many
of the Sequire SaaS platform agreements provide customers the ability to pay for the services with the issuance of the customers’
securities including common stock. The amount of consideration for these contracts is based on the estimated fair value of the underlying
securities on the contract date. See “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for details over the calculation of fair value.
When
Sequire SaaS platform contracts contain multiple performance obligations, transaction consideration is allocated to each individual performance
obligation based on a relative Stand-Alone Selling Price (“SSP,”) basis. The Company determines SSP based on the price at
which the performance obligation would be sold separately.
Subscription
revenue is generally non-refundable regardless of the actual use and is recognized ratably over the non-cancellable contract term beginning
on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Company’s service is first made available to customers.
Managed
Services and Ancillary Data revenue is typically recognized using an output measure of progress by looking at the time elapsed as the
contracts generally provide the customer equal benefit throughout the contract period because the Company transfers control evenly by
providing a stand-ready service.
LD
Micro - Conference Revenue
LD
Micro agreements cover a specific event and provide for payment in advance or at the time of the event. Conference revenue from attendee
fees and sponsorship fees is recognized at the time of the event (i.e., at a point-in-time).
Contract
Receivables
Contracts
receivable represents amounts for which non-cancellable revenue contracts with customers have been finalized but the payment in the form
of securities issued by the customer have not been received by the Company.
Deferred
Revenue
Deferred
revenue resulting from amounts billed to, or cash received from, customers in advance of the Company satisfying its performance obligation
and recognizing the applicable revenue.
Preferred
stock
Preferred
stock liability represents amounts payable to holders of the Preferred Stock Series A shares upon the eventual liquidation of assets
designated for the sole purpose of paying dividends. Accordingly, the Company classified the Series A Preferred Shares as liability instruments
because in-substance, they represent a right to the payment of dividends upon the liquidation of specified assets, are automatically
returnable to the Company after the payments are made and feature no rights to further equity or residual interests in the Company.
Costs
to Obtain or Costs to Fulfill a Contract
The
Company has no costs that qualify as costs to obtain or costs to fulfill customer contracts.
12
Net
Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect to all potentially dilutive common
shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive shares associated with options and warrants there were in the money were computed using the treasury stock
method and dilutive shares associated with convertible debt were computed using the if-converted method, which includes the effect of
excluding the convertible debenture interest expense from net income.
Securities that could potentially dilute basic net
income per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share were
1,770,885
and
11,867,520
during three months ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 respectively, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive
Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In
June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU 2022-03
Fair Value Measurements , which clarifies
the guidance in ASC 820
Fair Value Measurement
(“ASC 820”), (1) when measuring the fair value of an equity security
subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, (2) to amend a related illustrative example, and (3)
to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value
in accordance with ASC 820. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU
2020-06,
Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options
which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation
models (including the cash conversion model and the beneficial conversion feature model) for convertible instruments. As a result, for
convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivative instruments or that do not result
in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract.
Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, and convertible
preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost as long as no other features require
bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. This guidance is effective on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)
addressing accounting for credit
losses on financial instruments, which is designed to provide financial statement users with more information about the expected credit
losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. When determining
such expected credit losses, the guidance requires companies to apply a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This guidance is effective
on a modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The
Company’s management reviewed all recently issued ASU’s not yet adopted by the Company and does not believe the future adoptions
of any such ASU’s may be expected to cause a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or the results
of its operations.
NOTE
3 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Background
On
February 4, 2021, the Company completed a share exchange agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with FPVD. As part of the
Exchange Agreement the Company transferred all of the BIGToken assets and
100 %
of the issued and outstanding shares of BIGToken for
149,562,566,534
shares of FPVD’s common stock and
5,000,000
shares of FPVD’s series A preferred stock. The Company accounted for the transaction as a reverse capitalization and resulted
in reducing the Company’s ownership in BIGToken from
100 % to
88.9 % and establishment of a non-controlling interest.
Subsequently, FPVD was renamed BIGToken.
Deconsolidation
On
December 29, 2021,
BIGToken (formerly FPVD) completed a merger transaction with BritePool, Inc. (“BritePool”) (the “Merger”)
resulting in the Company’s ownership in BIGToken being reduced from 66% to approximately 4.99%.
As a result of the Merger, BIGToken
issued
183,445,351,631
shares of its common stock (“Acquisition Shares”) for all of the issued and outstanding equity shares
of BritePool. On December 29, 2021, as a condition for the closing of the Merger, the Company exchanged
149,562,566,534
shares of BIGToken
common stock for
242,078
shares of BIGToken’s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series D Stock”) (the “Exchange”).
Simultaneously with the Exchange, the Company converted
22,162
shares of the Series D Stock into
13,692,304,136
shares of BIGToken’s
common stock, or approximately
4.99 % of the issued and outstanding shares of BIGToken’s common stock.
Subsequent
to the transaction, the Company now owns
220,000
shares of BIGToken’s series D convertible, non-redeemable, non-voting preferred
stock and
13,692,304,136
shares of its common stock. As a result of the transaction, the Company no longer has a controlling financial
interest in BIGToken and deconsolidated BIGToken effective December 29, 2021, recognizing a
loss
of $ 10.7
million as follows:

The
Company determined the Series D Stock would be classified as a Level 3 asset as there is no observable market for quoted market price
for an identical asset. The Company engaged an independent third-party valuation expert to estimate the fair value of the Series D Stock.
The
financial results of BIGToken are presented as loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Company’s unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The historical Condensed Consolidated Statement

SALE AND PURCHASE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Sales
In
2020, the Company entered into certain financing agreements providing for the sale, with full recourse, of certain of its accounts receivable.
These transactions were accounted for as financing of accounts receivable and the related accounts receivable were not removed from the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet at the time of the transaction; rather, a liability was recorded for the proceeds received.
In 2020 subsequent to the transactions, the purchaser converted the payables into approximately $ 788,000
of the OID Convertible Notes
payable (“Debentures”) (See Note 8 - OID Convertible notes payable).
For
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with a third-party lender whereby it sold the Company’s right
to future subscription revenues of $ 625,000
for net proceeds of $ 576,000 . Under the terms of the agreement, the Company may borrow funds
collateralized by the right to the revenues from Sequire platform contracts. The third-party lender receives a discount on the amount
sold and remits the net amount to the Company. The Company bears the risk of credit loss on the contracts. These transactions are accounted
for as secured borrowing arrangements and not as a sale of financial assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2022 the Company
entered into agreements with third party lenders to borrow against future receipts in the amount of $ 2,164,000 . The Company received
net proceeds of $ 2,084,000 , representing an aggregate OID of approximately
4 %. These borrowings have terms of less than 12 months.
The
amount of borrowings outstanding was approximately $ 3,786,000
and $ 631,000
as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in other current liabilities
within our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Purchase
Beginning
in the fourth quarter of 2021 and through March 31, 2022, the Company purchased certain accounts receivable from its formerly consolidated
subsidiary, BIGtoken providing for BIGtoken to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Company all rights, title and interest
for its receivable aggregating $ 914,000
for a purchase price of $ 857,000 , representing a
6 % discount. As of March 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, the outstanding receivable amounts to $ 352,000 , which was included in accounts receivables and collected subsequent to March 31, 2022.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The
Company offers its customers the option to settle the contract price in the customer’s issued and publicly trading securities or
securities convertible into publicly traded securities (e.g., convertible debt), which could be in the form of common stock, preferred
stock or convertible debentures. The Company initially values the securities received at the fair market value on the date the contract
is executed, which value is used for revenue recognition purposes. After receipt of the securities, the securities are accounted for
as investments in debt and equity securities. The Company has concluded that all its debt securities should be classified as trading
securities based on its intent to sell them in the near term. Debt securities classified as trading securities and the equity securities
are measured at each reporting period at fair value with changes reported in earnings. Upon the sale of the securities, the Company recognizes
the final realized gain or (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss).
The
following tables summarize the changes in the Company’s marketable securities during the three months ended March 31, 2022:

The
Company’s sales of securities for the three months ended March 31, 2022, were approximately $ 1.3
million, with a book basis of
approximately $ 2.3
million which represented a loss of approximately $ 1
million, which the Company recorded as other income included
in the gains from marketable securities.
The
equity securities may be accounted for and classified into two categories and accounted for as follows:
● Equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
included in earnings. The fair value of equity investments with fair values is primarily obtained from third-party pricing services.
● Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are reported at their cost minus impairment, if any,
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same
issuer and their impact on fair value. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, when an orderly transaction for
the identical or similar investment of the same issuer is identified, the Company uses valuation techniques to evaluate the observed transaction(s)
and adjust the fair value of the equity investment.
Concentration
Risk
The
Company’s holdings in marketable securities subject the Company to concentrations of market risks.
As
of March 31, 2022, the Company’s top six marketable security positions had an aggregate fair value of $ 13.1
million, which represented
45 % of the Company’s holdings. Excluding marketability and liquidity discounts, these positions had an aggregate value of $ 14.9
million as of March 31, 2022. As of November 30, 2022 these positions have an aggregate value, excluding marketability and liquidity
discounts of $ 9.1
million, which represents a decrease of approximately
39 % from March 31, 2022.
BIGtoken
Investment
On
February 15, 2022, the Company entered into a simple agreement for future equity (the “SAFE”) with its former BIGToken subsidiary.
Pursuant to the SAFE, the Company invested $ 1,000,000
in the SAFE. The amount funded into the SAFE at a given time is referred to herein
as the “SAFE Amount”. The Company is accounting for the SAFE as an equity investment carried at fair value with changes recorded
in earnings each period and is reflected as such in the above table.
16
Pursuant
to the terms of the SAFE, at any time that BIGtoken sells its securities (a “Financing”) prior to the termination of the
SAFE, the Company may, at its option, convert the SAFE into: (i) the number of shares of non-voting Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
(“Series D Preferred Stock”) equal to such (a) SAFE Amount divided by (b) the lowest price per share of equity securities
sold in any Financing (prior to the termination of the SAFE) multiplied by eighty percent (80%) (the “Conversion Price”)
and (ii) such number of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred Stock (the “Warrants”) equal to the SAFE Amount divided by
the Conversion Price. Upon issuance, the Warrants will (i) have a term of five (5) years, (ii) an exercise price equal to the Conversion
Price, and (iii) contain price protection provisions for subsequent financings.

NOTES RECEIVABLE
In
October 2020, the Company entered into unit redemption agreements with two counterparties providing for the counterparties to
repurchase from the Company units of the counterparty’s securities owned by the Company. Pursuant to the redemption
agreements, the counterparties repurchased the units for a combined repurchase price of $ 8
million with $ 7
million being paid on closing and the additional $ 1
million being deferred and due on the earlier of the three-year anniversary or upon sale of the counterparties. The Company had no
cost basis in the units and as a result the note receivable has no cost basis. The Company accounts for the note receivable as a
loan pursuant to ASC 310 – Loans . The $ 1
million in deferred payments was recorded with an implied discount of approximately $ 107,000 ,
which is being amortized
over
3 years .
NOTE

OID CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE
In
June 2020, the Company entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement or Transaction”)
with certain accredited and institutional investors (the “Purchasers”) for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of: (i)
$ 16,101,000
in principal amount of Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture (the “Debentures”) for $ 14,169,000
(representing a
12 % original issue discount) (“Purchase Price”) and (ii) warrants to purchase up to
6,440,561
shares of the
Company’s Class A common stock (the “Warrants”) in a private placement (the “Offering”). The Purchase Price
consisted of (a) $ 13,000,000
in cash and (b) the cancellation of $ 1,169,000
in outstanding debt. The Company received net proceeds of
approximately $ 9,100,000
after deducting the Placement Agent fees, the Debt Repayments and other offering expenses. The Company’s
obligations under the Debentures are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.
17
The
Debentures pay interest in cash at the rate of
12.0 % per annum commencing on June 30, 2021, with such interest originally payable quarterly,
beginning on October 1, 2021. Commencing after the six-month anniversary of the issuance of the Debentures, the Company was required
to make amortization payments (“Amortization Payments”) with each Purchaser having the right to delay such Amortization Payments
by a six-month period up to three separate times (each, an “Extension”) in exchange for five percent (5%) in principal being
added to the balance of such applicable Debenture on each such Extension. The Debentures had an original maturity date of
December 31,
2021
but were extended three times and now mature on June 30, 2023. Beginning on the date that the first Amortization Payment is due,
and on a monthly basis thereafter, the Company will be required to pay one hundred fifteen percent of the value of one-twelfth of the
outstanding principal plus any additional accrued interest due.
The
Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price
of $ 2.69
per share, subject to adjustment in the event of (i) stock splits and dividends, (ii) subsequent rights offerings, (iii) pro-rata
distributions, and (iv) certain fundamental transactions, including but not limited to the sale of the Company, business combinations,
and reorganizations.
In
the event a Purchaser converts a portion of its Debenture into shares of the Company’s Common Stock, such amount will be deducted
from the next applicable Amortization Payment. In the event such conversion exceeds the next applicable Amortization Payment, such excess
amount will be deducted, in reverse order, from future Amortization Payments.
Pursuant
to the terms of the Debentures and Warrants, a Purchaser will not have the right to convert any portion of the Debentures or exercise
any portion of the Warrants if the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% or 9.99% (at the Purchaser’s
option) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or exercise, as such percentage
ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Debentures and the Warrants; provided that at the election of a holder and
notice to us such percentage ownership limitation may be increased to 9.99%; provided that any increase will not be effective until the
61st day after such notice is delivered from the holder to the Company.
Subject
to the Company’s compliance with certain conditions, upon ten trading days’ notice to the Purchasers, the Company has the
right to redeem the Debentures in cash at 115% of their outstanding principal, plus accrued interest. Additionally, in the event that
the Company (i) sells or reprices any securities (each, a “Redemption Financing”), or (ii) disposes of assets (except those
sold or transferred in the ordinary course of business) (each, an “Asset Sale”), then the Purchasers shall have the right
to (a) in the event of a Redemption Financing at a price per Common Stock equivalent of $2.50 or less per share, the Purchasers may mandate
that 100% of the proceeds be used to redeem the Debentures (b) in the event of a Redemption Financing at a price per Common Stock equivalent
of greater than $2.50 per share, the Purchasers may mandate that up to 50% of the proceeds be used to redeem the Debentures, and (c)
in the event of an Asset Sale, the Purchasers may mandate that up to 100% of the proceeds be used to redeem the Debentures.
The
Debentures also contain certain customary events of default provisions, including, but not limited to, payment default, breaches of covenants,
the occurrence of an event of default under certain material contracts of the Company, failure to register the shares underlying the
Debentures and Warrants, changes in control of the Company, delisting of its securities from its trading market, and the entering or
filing of certain monetary judgments against the Company. Upon the occurrence of any such event of default, the outstanding principal
amount of the Debenture plus liquidated damages, interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration,
shall become, at the Purchaser’s election, immediately due and payable in cash.
The Company is also prohibited from certain activities
(unless waived by 67% of the then outstanding Purchasers, and including the lead Purchaser), including but not limited to, the creation
of certain debt obligations, liens on Company assets, amending its charter documents, repayment or repurchase of securities or certain
debt of the Company, or the payment of dividends.
The
Warrants are initially exercisable at $ 2.50
per share and, are subject to cashless exercise after six months if the shares underlying
the Warrants are not subject to an effective resale registration statement. The Warrants are also subject to adjustment in the event
of (i) stock splits and dividends, (ii) subsequent rights offerings, (iii) pro-rata distributions, and (iv) certain fundamental transactions,
including but not limited to the sale of the Company, business combinations, and reorganizations.
Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”), the Company has agreed to file a registration statement
registering the resale of the shares of the common stock underlying the Debentures and the Warrants within forty-five days from the date
of the Registration Rights Agreement. The Company also agrees to have the registration statement declared effective within 90 days from
the date of the Registration Rights Agreement and keep the registration statement continuously effective until the earlier of (i) the
date after which all of the securities to be registered thereunder have been sold, or (ii) the date on which all the securities to be
registered thereunder may be sold without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions and without current public information pursuant to Rule
144 under the Securities Act. The Company is also obligated to pay the Investors, as partial liquidated damages, a fee of 2.0% of each
Purchaser’s subscription amount per month in cash upon the occurrence of certain events, including the Company’s failure
to file and/or have the registration statement declared effective within the time periods provided. As of March 31, 2022, the Company has continuously met its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement.
18
Bradley
Woods & Co. Ltd. (“Placement Agent”) acted as the placement agent, in connection with the sale of the securities. Pursuant
to an engagement agreement, the Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash commission of $ 1,040,000
and issue an aggregate of
478,854
Common Stock purchase warrants (“PA Warrants”). The PA Warrants are substantially similar to the Warrants, except that the
PA Warrants have an exercise price of $ 3.3625
per share. Additionally, upon the exercise of the Warrants issued in the Offering, the
Placement Agent will be entitled to eight percent ( 8 %) of the cash proceeds received from such exercises. The fair value of the PA Warrants
at issuance was estimated to be $ 360,000 .
The
Company first allocated the cash proceeds to the loan and the equity classified warrants on a relative fair value basis, secondly, the
proceeds were allocated to the beneficial conversion feature. The proceeds allocated to the warrants and the beneficial conversion feature
resulted in a debt discount being amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term.

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK
Common
Stock
The
Company’s certificate of incorporation provides for two classes of common stock: Class A common stock (authorized
250,000,000
shares,
par value $ 0.001 ), which has one vote per share, and Class B common stock (authorized
9,000,000
shares, par value $ 0.001 ), which has
ten votes per share. Any holder of Class B common stock may convert his or her shares at any time into shares of Class A common stock
on a share-for-share basis. Otherwise, the rights of the two classes of common stock are identical.
In
August 2021, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up
to $ 10,000,000
of Class A Common Stock in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market at prices per share not exceeding the
then-current market prices. Under the program, management has discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and
the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. This includes purchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans,
including accelerated share repurchases. The program does not have an expiration date.
During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased
155,000
shares of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 793,000
pursuant to the Company’s Share Buy-Back program. The shares were retired as of December 31, 2021.
No
amounts were repurchased
in the three months ended March 31, 2022. The total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under the Company’s
share repurchase program was $ 9.2
million as of March 31, 2022.
During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold
53,616
shares of common stock, resulting in proceeds of approximately $ 284,000 , through
sales under its At the Market (ATM) offering.
Preferred
Stock
The
Company is authorized to issue
50,000,000
of preferred stock, par value $ 0.001 , of which
36,462,417
shares are designated as Series A
Preferred Stock (“Dividend Shares”). The Company’s Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue
preferred stock in one or more series from time to time and fix or alter the designations, relative rights, priorities, preferences,
qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the shares of each series. The rights, preferences, limitations and restrictions of different
series of preferred stock may differ with respect to dividend rates, amounts payable on liquidation, voting rights, conversion rights,
redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions and other matters. The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock,
which ranks senior to the Company’s common stock for the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation. In
addition, the Board of Directors can fix limitations and restrictions, if any, upon the payment of dividends on both classes of the Company’s
common stock to be effective while any shares of preferred stock are outstanding.
19
On
September 20, 2021, the Company filed a certificate of designation (the “COD”) of preferences, rights, and limitations of
Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. Pursuant to the
COD, the Company is authorized to issue up to
36,462,417
shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Dividend Shares”).
On
September 27, 2021,
the Company issued a one-time dividend of
36,462,417
shares of series A preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”)
to certain Qualified Recipients (the “Dividend”) which is convertible into shares of common stock on a 1 for 1 basis.
The
preferred stock entitles the Qualified Recipients with the right to receive the net proceeds from sales of certain marketable securities
that the Company received through its Sequire Platform services. See Note 6 – Designated Assets for Return of Capital.
As
of the Record Date, the following holders of securities were entitled to receive the Dividend (collectively, the “Qualified Recipients):
i. each
outstanding share of Class A common stock (the “Common Stock”), of which
25,160,504
shares were issued and outstanding,
ii. each
share of Common Stock underlying outstanding common stock purchase warrants containing a
contractual right to receive the Dividend (“Warrants”) of which,
10,327,645
were
outstanding, and
iii. each
original issue discount senior convertible debenture (the “Debentures”) issued
on June 30, 2021, containing a contractual right to receive the Dividend on an as converted
to Common Stock basis, of which $ 2,486,275
of Debentures were outstanding in principal and
interest, convertible into
974,268
shares of Common Stock.
The Company’s management has evaluated the Preferred Stock and determined that Preferred Stock is mandatorily
redeemable upon the distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of the designated marketable securities. Accordingly, it is classified
as a liability recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value being reflected in earnings.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS AND WARRANTS
Equity
Compensation Plans
As
of March 31, 2022, the Company has approximately
228,000
shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Company’s
equity compensation plans.
In
the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company issued the below shares and granted the following stock-based awards:
On January 2, 2022, Michael Malone, our Chief Financial Officer exercised an option to purchase
100,000
shares of our common stock that was issued on December 15, 2018. The option was exercised on a cashless basis and included

16,732
shares withheld for tax withholding. Accordingly, we issued Mr. Malone
26,252
shares of common stock.
On January 3, 2022, we issued four (4) common stock purchase options to our non-employee directors, pursuant to our amended non-employee director compensation policy. Each option entitled the holder to purchase
29,533
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $ 4.35
per share, for an aggregate exercise amount of $ 128,500 . The options vest in equal quarterly over a one ( 1 ) year period from the issuance date. The options expire on the seven ( 7 ) year anniversary of the issuance date. Each option has a Black-Scholes value of $ 100,000 .
During the month of January 2022, non-executive employees exercised a total of
227,667
stock options. These options were exercised on a cashless basis, and included
161,938
shares withheld pursuant to cashless exercise and tax withholdings. This resulted in the issuance of
65,729
shares of common stock.
On
January 6, 2022, we issued non-executive employees, options to purchase
380,000
shares of Class A common stock. The option has an exercise
price of $ 4.25

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The
carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate
their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of such instruments.
The
carrying amount of our debt and notes receivable approximate their fair value.
Valuation
of Marketable Securities
An
integral part of the Company’s fair value measurement process is the assessment of the type of securities as well as the securities’
liquidity and marketability. Warrants are initially valued at cost, if acquired for cash, or at intrinsic value. Convertible debt is
valued based on an analysis of the implied call option and a discounted cash flow analysis of the debt component. Equity securities are
valued using the quoted prices times the number of shares acquired. The securities are then evaluated based on their marketability (usually
based on the restrictions on resale into the securities primary market) and liquidity.
Investments
in restricted securities of public companies cannot be offered for sale to the public until the company complies with certain statutory
requirements. Investments in restricted securities of public companies are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
However, investments in public companies may be categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the level of observable
liquidity. Specifically, if the Company determines the market activity is not sufficient to conclude the market activity represents an
Active Market.
Assets
and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The
Company evaluates its financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate
level in which to classify them for each reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made. The Company
considers marketable securities without sufficient liquidity to sell within 6 months of the date of acquisition and securities that will
not be eligible for resale in the public markets through Rule 144 for 1 year from the date acquisition to be valued with Level 2 inputs.
The
contract assets represent a forward contractual right to receive securities pursuant to a revenue contract. As of March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, the Company determined the value of the securities underlying the contract asset to have a fair value of $ 1,460,000
and $ 844,000 ,
respectively. Contract assets within level 3 at December 31, 2021 were received during the three months ended March 31, 2022, and
are now included within marketable securities. Contract assets as of March 31, 2022 relate to new contracts for which securities have
not been received.

Changes
in Level 3 assets measured at fair value
The
following table presents additional information about Level 3 assets measured at fair value. Both observable and unobservable inputs
may be used to determine the fair value of assets classified within the Level 3 category. As a result, the unrealized gains and losses
for the assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable
and unobservable inputs. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period in which a change
in valuation technique or methodology occurs. Changes in Level 3 assets measured at fair value the three months ended March 31, 2022,

Valuation
processes for Level 2 and 3 Fair Value Measurements
Fair
value measurement of certain of our marketable securities fall within Level 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurements
are evaluated by management to ensure that changes are consistent with expectations of management based upon the sensitivity and nature
of the inputs.
The
Company classifies certain assets as Level 3 assets if the estimated fair value was derived from level 3 inputs. The Company utilizes
a put option pricing model to arrive at a discount for lack of marketability and liquidity associated with restrictions on sales into
the public market. The Company generally classifies restricted securities in public companies as level 2, however in circumstances where
the observed level of liquidity is low and the quoted market price is deemed unreliable they may be categorized in Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy. The Company considers marketable securities without sufficient liquidity to sell within 6 months of the date of acquisition
and securities that will not be eligible for resale in the public markets through Rule 144 for 1 year from the date acquisition to be
valued with Level 2 inputs.
The
fair value of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock may change significantly, impacting the Company’s assumptions used to
estimate its fair value. The valuation of the Series A Preferred Stock is primarily based on the valuation of its underlying marketable
securities. The marketable securities that are underlying the Series A Preferred Stock are classified as Designated Assets on the Company’s
balance sheet and include Level 1 and Level 2 marketable securities and cash.
The
following table lists the significant unobservable inputs used to value assets classified as Level 3 of March 31, 2022. The table is
not intended to be all-inclusive, but instead identifies the significant unobservable inputs relevant to the determination of fair values.
The other Level 3 assets have been valued using unadjusted third-party transactions and, unadjusted historical third-party information,
or the unadjusted net asset values of the securities’ issuer. No unobservable inputs internally developed by the Company have been
applied to these assets, and therefore are omitted from the following table.

Sensitivity
of Level 3 measurements to changes in significant unobservable inputs
The
process of estimating the fair value of securities without active markets involves significant estimates and judgement on behalf of management.
These estimated fair values may not be realized in a current sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there
are inherent uncertainties in any fair value measurement techniques, and changes in the underlying assumptions used could significantly
affect the fair value measurement amounts.
Changes
in each of these significant unobservable valuation inputs will impact the fair value measurement of the financial instrument generally
as follows:
●
An increase or decrease in the volatility of the common stock that underlies our holdings in convertible debt would result in a directionally
similar change in the estimated fair value.
●
An increase or decrease in the risk-free interest rate or risk adjusted discount factor would result in an inverse change in the estimated
fair value of our convertible debt.
●
An increase in the dividend yield would increase the estimated value of the convertible debt.
●
A change in the maturity may result in either an increase or decrease in estimated fair value of the convertible debt.
●
An increase or decrease in the discount for lack of marketability of our common stock holdings and the common stock that underlies our
preferred stock would generally result in an inverse change in the estimated fair value.
Instruments
for which unobservable inputs are significant to their fair value measurement (i.e., Level 3) include securities in which we deem their
market to be inactive or unreliable. The Company reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes
from one quarter to the next that are related to the observable inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from
one hierarchy level to another.

in principal of the Company’s Original Issue Discount Senior Secured
Convertible Debentures (“Debentures”), representing all of the outstanding Debentures that were originally issued on June
30, 2020, entered into an agreement with the Company to
(i) extend the maturity date of the Debentures until December 31, 2023 and (ii)
extend the first date that monthly redemptions are required to be made by the Company to begin on January 1, 2023 (the “Debenture
Extension”). As consideration for the Debenture Extension, the Company increased the principal amount outstanding on the Debentures

Bridge
Note
On
July 1, 2022, the Company issued an original issue discount bridge note in principal amount of $ 650,000
(“Bridge Note”) to
an institutional investor in exchange for $ 500,000
in cash. The bridge note was non-interest bearing and had a maturity date of
August
15, 2022 . The Company’s obligations pursuant to the bridge note were secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company
pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement.
On
August 8, 2022, as described below, the Bridge Note was exchanged for a revolving note in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.
Senior
Secured Revolving Credit Facility
On
August 8, 2022, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility agreement with an institutional investor to initially
borrow up to $ 9,450,000
in the aggregate from time to time (each a “Revolving Loan”). The loan maximum amount accessible
is limited to $ 5.5
million until the Company is current with its reporting obligations. The loan is secured by all the assets of the
Company and is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, LD Micro, Inc. As part of the transaction, the Company also
amended and restated lender’s outstanding warrants to extend the maturity date of a total of
2,590,358
Common Stock purchase warrants
until
September 30, 2023 .
On
closing, the lender advanced $ 5,580,000
consisting of $ 4,930,000
in cash and the exchange of the existing outstanding $ 650,000
bridge
note. Upon the Company meeting certain conditions, the Lender will advance up to an additional $ 3,870,000 .
The
principal balance of each Revolving Loan will reflect an original issue discount of ten percent (10%); provided that beginning on the
date that is twelve (12) months from the Effective Date, such original issue discount will increase to twelve percent (12%) in the event
the Prime borrowing rate increases to 6.75%. The Revolving Loans have a maturity date of the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months from
the Effective Date or (ii) the occurrence of an event of default, as described in the Loan Documents .
Commencing
on the first day of each month after the Effective Date, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Loan will be paid as calculated based
on a percentage of the Company’s collections from the sale of certain of its marketable securities.
The
Revolving Note is initially convertible into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $15.00 per share (“Conversion Price”).
The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, dividends, fundamental transactions and certain future sales
of the Company’s Common Stock .
As
consideration for Lender entering into the Loan Documents, Lender will be entitled to receive, in addition to any payment made under
the Credit Agreement, 10% of the net proceeds received by the Company from the sales of securities received during the term of the Revolving
Loan.
For
the Company to enter into the Credit Agreement, we were required to issue
32,000
shares of the Company’s common stock as a breakup
fee to an unrelated lender as a result of a failed offering.
Extension

reduced from 66% to approximately 4.99%. As a result of the Merger, BIGToken issued 183,445,351,631 shares of its common stock (“Acquisition
Shares”) for all of the issued and outstanding equity shares of BritePool. On December 29, 2021, as a condition for the closing
of the Merger, the Company exchanged 149,562,566,534 shares of BIGToken common stock for 242,078 shares of BIGToken’s Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock (“Series D Stock”) (the “Exchange”). Simultaneously with the Exchange, the Company converted 22,162
shares of the Series D Stock into 13,692,304,136 shares of BIGToken’s common stock, or approximately 4.99% of the issued and outstanding
shares of BIGToken’s common stock.
The
financial results of BIGToken’s business are presented as discontinued operations in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement
of Operations for all periods presented through the respective transaction close date as the transaction. Please see “Note 3 —
Discontinued Operations” in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional

Business
Focus
During
the first quarter of 2022, we have focused on: (i) the continued growth of our Sequire platform’s functionality and user base and
(ii) the expansion of LD micro events and offerings.
Covid-19
Our
business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to
contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and
shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas,
both regionally and worldwide, which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations. We are unable to predict the
impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility.
27
More
recently, we believe the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increasing
consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, and we experienced increasing demand for our products as a result of
these trends. The impact of the pandemic on our overall results of operations, remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future.
We
intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities, and we anticipate that additional investments in our network
infrastructure, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth throughout the remainder
of 2022.
Company
Overview
We
are a technology firm focused on enhancing communications between public companies and their shareholders and investors. We currently
have two distinct business units:
●
Our unique SaaS platform, Sequire, which allows issuers to track their shareholders’ behaviors and trends, then use data-driven
insights to engage with shareholders across marketing channels. Through Sequire, we offer tools and related data and insight services
to allow issuers of publicly traded securities to better understand their position in the market.
●
LD Micro organizes and hosts investor conferences for micro and small-cap companies.
We
derive our revenues from the:
●
Licensing
of our proprietary SaaS platform;
●
Sales
of proprietary data;
●
Attendance
and sponsorship fees from investor conferences and events; and
●
Sales
of insight and consulting services.
Sequire
The
Sequire platform is a central hub where companies can manage certain administrative functions, reach out and engage with shareholders
as well as identify potential new investors. The platform utilizes machine learning and advanced analytics to bring our clients actionable
information that we believe can be used to maximize ROI through better investor and stockholder communications. Clients then can engage
with targeted shareholder groups across marketing channels including email, social media, programmatic, and hyperlocal.
When
interpreting data, clients can see gains and losses over time, buying/selling trends, total outstanding shares, new shareholders, and
shareholders broken out by percentage. Based on this data, we can assist our users in developing customized communications campaign utilizing
targeted ads and messaging.
Among
other features, the Sequire platform provides its users tools to monitor investor sentiment and activities and simplify back office administration
such as:
●
real-time
level-two trading data,
●
the
ability to monitor the activities of competitive public companies of the user,
●
news
alerts,
●
custom
survey feature to enhance shareholder communications;
●
real-time
and searchable warrant and option ledgers; and
●
integrated
communication between investor relations programs and corporate communication firms.
Data
Targeting
We
help our clients build an investor base through targeted advertising and marketing campaigns, tailored to their needs. Using data-driven
insights, we help clients meet their unique marketing objectives, whether they’re messaging existing investors, new investors,
or consumers.
28
Our
team of experts takes a deep dive into each company, building out unique messaging to suit their target investors. Once media campaigns
are built, they are run through the Sequire platform across multiple target segments. We then track performance and modify the campaign
for the best possible results. Our clients have needs to target particular sectors and exchanges, and the value we deliver lies in the
hyper-specific investor insights necessary for that kind of focused outreach.
We
are maximizing the efficacy of our media campaigns by providing our clients with custom-built landing pages that are crafted to educate,
engage, and convert new investors. When a new investor clicks through an ad, they will land on a story-driven page with data-tracking
software embedded to collect analytics for later use.
Virtual
Events and LD Micro
LD
Micro is the premier event platform for micro-cap and small cap companies. In September of 2020, we acquired LD Micro, and hosted the
2020 Main Event on our Sequire Virtual Events platform. The 2021 Main Event had over 3,000 attendees and hosted webinars with over 500
companies. We are currently planning to expand the number and subject matter of our conferences and events. Through the events platform,
we have the ability to host a variety of virtual events and conferences including investor conferences, earnings calls, shareholder meetings,
annual, investor/analyst days, corporate town halls, roadshows, and more. We believe that our ability to offer users a seamless, centrally
managed virtual events solution that can be customized to any industry will help transform our platform into the premier investor event
tool.
Marketing
and sales
We
market our services through our in-house sales and marketing team. Our team focuses on social media, including Facebook, LinkedIn and
Twitter, public relations (PR), industry events and the creation of white papers which assist in our marketing efforts and are used as
lead generation tools.
Intellectual
property
We
currently rely on a combination of patents, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing
on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants
and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. We
currently have eight (8) US patent applications filed.
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Going
Concern
Cash
on hand and marketable securities at March 31, 2022 was approximately $0.4 million and $28.8 million, respectively. Based upon our cash
flow projections taking into account cash, marketable securities and the projected cash flows from operations and access to borrowings
under our revolving line of credit we believe we have enough liquidity, taking into account the uncertainty related to the ongoing pandemic
and general economic uncertainty, to continue to fund operations at their currently level through the remainder of the year.
The
Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate operating cash flow. In
addition, the Company’s operations may require additional financial support or additional financing. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of the
consolidated financial statements. The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
Cash,
Cash Equivalents, and Investments
As
of March 31, 2022, we had (i) cash of $0.4 million, and (ii) marketable securities of $28.8 million for a total of approximately $29.2
million as compared to $17.0 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments
such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. Certain of such unused amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions
prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient subscriptions and customer contracts).

Revenues
Sequire
Platform.
We recognize revenue from the licensing of our Sequire platform, data, marketing and insight services performed in conjunction
with the Sequire platform. We recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method based primarily on time.
Conference
Revenue.
We recognize revenue from hosting conferences and associated sponsorships. We receive payment from presenting companies
and sponsors of the conferences.
Operating
Expenses
Cost
of revenue.
Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the cost of media from third parties.
Employee

Marketing
and selling expenses.
These are the costs we incur to market our products, data service fees and third-party selling costs.
Depreciation

Depreciation and Amortization cost represent an allocation of the costs incurred to acquire the long-lived assets
used in our business over their estimated useful lives. Our long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and internally developed
software.
General
and administrative.
General and administrative expense consists primarily of human resources, information technology, professional
fees, IT and facility overhead, and other general corporate expense. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in
absolute dollars primarily as a result of the increased costs associated with being a stand-alone public company. However, we also expect
our general and administrative expense to fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue in future periods based on fluctuations in our revenue
and the timing of such expense.

of revenue.
Cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31 2022 and 2021 were approximately $2,798,000 and $1,377,000, respectively.
This increase is a result of the increased revenues. As a percentage of total revenue, the cost of revenues increased from 28% to 37%.
The increase as a percentage of revenues is the result of a greater percentage of revenues derived from serviced based revenue.
Employee
Related Costs.
Employee related costs increased to $2,497,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to $1,550,000
for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in staffing expenses or headcount required to service the increased number of platform subscribers as well as an increase in the number
of subscribers utilizing the Company’s service offering.
Platform
costs .
Platform costs for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 were $76,000 and $20,000, respectively. Platform costs include costs incurred to host and maintain the Company’s Sequire platform. These costs increased
from the prior year due to the increase in platform capacity and functionality required to support the growth in the Company’s subscriber
based of the Sequire platform.
Marketing,
data services and sales.
Marketing, data services and sales for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1,413,000 and
$994,000, respectively. Marketing and data costs increased versus prior year as a result of an increase in the costs incurred to service the expanded customer base.
Depreciation
and Amortization.
Our long-lived assets primarily consist of internally developed software. For the three months ended March 31,
2022 and 2021 depreciation and amortization were $187,000 and $256,000, respectively.
General
and administrative.
General and administrative expenses were approximately $1,856,000 and $295,000 for the three months ended March
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in expense for the year is driven by an increase in corporate related expenses to support
the growth of the Company.
Other
income / (loss).
Other income / (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021was $5.1 million versus a loss of $4.7
million. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 this included approximately $9.3 million in financing charges. This is primarily
comprised of a non-cash inducement charge of $7.7 million related to our February 2021 warrant financing. Unrealized gains on our
marketable securities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 were $6.4 million as compared to $4.0 million for the comparable
period of 2021.

Cash
flows from continuing operating activities
The
primary use of operating cash is to pay our media, data and platform vendors, employees and others for a wide range of services. Cash
flows used in continuing operating activities increased by approximately $0.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 as
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. This is primarily due to increases in operating expense, which include increases in media, data
and employee related costs.
The
Company expects to continue to use cash in excess of receipts generated from operations for the foreseeable future due to the
substantial portion of the Company’s sales paid for in marketable securities of our customers. The Company classifies proceeds
from the sales of marketable securities received from our customers for the payment of our services as investing
activities.
Cash
flows from continuing investing activities
Our
principal recurring investing activities are the funding of our internal software development and the sale of marketable securities.
During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash provided by investing activities increased by $205,000. During the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company generated $1,277,000 and $2,266,000, respectively from the sale of marketable securities.
Expenditures for software development were $243,000 and $154,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deferred
payments related to our acquisition of LD Micro during the three months ended March 31, 2021, were $1,004,000.
Cash
flows from continuing financing activities
During
the three months ended March 31, 2022, cash generated from financing activities was primarily attributable to $3,153,000 of proceeds,
net of payments from our short-term borrowings partially offset by $101,000 of payments for withholding taxes related to our restricted
stock units. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we generated $12,220,000 of proceeds from the exercise of warrants and $284,000
of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock.
Liquidity
We believe that our current sources of funds will
not provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 2022 including to repay our remaining debt obligations.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, however, the Company’s primary source of capital is the sale of marketable
securities received as consideration for the licensing of our Sequire platform and the associated services. The Company’s sales
of marketable securities are primarily through sale transactions that qualify for exemptions pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act
of 1933. The conditions required to be met to qualify for the exemptions under Rule 144 are often difficult to predict, making it difficult
to predict the timing of the associated cash flows from the sales of these securities. The Company’s holdings of marketable securities
are subject to risks and uncertainties such as fluctuations in pricing in the primary market, and legal restrictions that create uncertainty
around realization and timing of cash flows. Additionally, other factors contribute to uncertainty of our cash flows, such as our subscription
growth rate, subscription renewal activity, including the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales
and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced products,
the continuing market adoption of Sequire.
The Company projects the sale of its marketable
security holding will represent a substantial portion of the cash required for operations for the foreseeable future, and as a consequence,
creates substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We expect to generate net positive operating income and cash flows from our Sequire business in the future, however,
due to uncertainty around the timing and realization of cash flow creates substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern.
During
the three months ended March 31, 2022 the Company entered into a factoring agreement with a financial institution to sell certain accounts
receivable and future sales of up to $3 million. The factoring agreement was fully paid off with the proceeds of our revolving credit
facility described below.
We
may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. Finally, we
continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund
the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing debt facilities. Conversely, we may also from time to time
determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early or repurchase our common stock through our
Stock buy-back program.
32
On
July 1, 2022, the Company issued an original issue discount bridge note in principal amount of $650,000 (“Bridge Note”) to
an institutional investor in exchange for $500,000 in cash. The bridge note was non-interest bearing and had a maturity date of August
15, 2022. The Company’s obligations pursuant to the bridge note were secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company
pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement.
On
July 1, 2022, the holders (“Holders”) of $1,102,682 in principal of the Company’s Original Issue Discount Senior Secured
Convertible Debentures (“Debentures”), representing all of the outstanding Debentures that were originally issued on June
30, 2020, entered into an agreement with the Company to (i) extend the maturity date of the Debentures until December 31, 2023 and (ii)
extend the first date that monthly redemptions are required to be made by the Company to begin on January 1, 2023 (the “Debenture
Extension”). As consideration for the Debenture Extension, the Company increased the principal amount outstanding on the Debentures
by five percent (5%). Additionally, the holders of the Debentures have the unilateral right to extend the maturity date and monthly redemption
period by an additional six (6) month period at any time prior to January 1, 2023 for an additional five percent (5%) to be added to
the outstanding principal of such Debentures. The Debentures, including the additional principal added to the Debentures are secured
by substantially all of the assets of the Company pursuant to a security agreement entered into between the Company and Holders contemporaneous
with the original issuance of the Debentures (the “Security Agreement”).
On
August 8, 2022, we entered into a revolving line of credit allowing us to borrow up to $9.45 million in principal. Until such time
that the Company becomes current on its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the maximum amount
accessible is limited to $5.6 million in August 2022. The revolving credit line has a two-year term with a variable repayment schedule that is
tied to the proceeds the Company generates from the sale of marketable securities from its portfolio. The principal repayment as a
percentage of proceeds from marketable securities is 10% for the first three months and increase up to 20% after 12 months. Further,
we agreed to pay the lender in the credit facility, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the net proceeds actually received by us
from the sale any securities of a customer that we acquired during the term of the revolving note(s).
As
of March 31, 2022, our cash on hand was approximately $0.4 million.
We
have historically financed our operations primarily from the sale of debt and equity securities. Recently, our operations from Sequire
and LD Micro have resulted in increased revenue, but we are still not cash flow positive, and accordingly cannot fund our operations
solely from our revenue. Notwithstanding our recent revolving credit facility financing (including the bridge note), for which we have
received approximately $5.6 million, partially offset by the required payments we made under outstanding obligations of $3.75 million
at closing, we are still unable to meet all of our obligations as they become due. We anticipate that we will need to continue to fund
our operations from the sale of debt and equity securities. Additionally, we are delinquent in our SEC reporting obligations and have
received notices from Nasdaq that if we are not current with our reporting obligations by February 28, 2023, we may be delisted
from NASDAQ. Although we have been historically successful in raising capital through the sale of our equity and debt securities, and
management believes that such capital sources will be available should they be required, there can be no assurance that financing will
be available to us when needed in order to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to us. Further,
in the event we are delisted from Nasdaq, raising capital through the sale of our equity or debt securities will be more challenging
as investors are historically less likely to purchase securities that are not listed on a national exchange.
Series
A Preferred Stock
During
2021 we issued 36,462,417 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to Qualified Recipients (as defined below) on a 1-for-1 as converted
to common stock basis (the “Dividend”). The record date for the Dividend was September 20, 2021 (the “Record Date”).
The Series A Preferred Stock entitles the Qualified Recipients to receive the net proceeds from sales of certain securities received
by SRAX as payment from its customers for access to the Sequire Platform services (the “Designated Assets”).
As
of the Record Date, the following holders of securities were entitled to receive the Dividend (collectively, the “Qualified Recipients”):
(i)
each
outstanding share of common stock, of which 25,160,504 shares were issued and outstanding,
(ii)
each
share of common stock underlying outstanding common stock purchase warrants containing a contractual right to receive the Dividend
of which, 10,377,645 were outstanding, and
(iii)
each
original issue discount senior convertible debenture issued on June 30, 2020, containing a contractual right to receive the Dividend
on an as converted to common stock basis, of which $2,486,275 of Debentures were outstanding in principal and interest, convertible
into 924,268 shares of common stock.
33
As
of the Record Date, the Designated Assets had an aggregate value of approximately $6.5 million and consisted of securities (i) from twenty-five
(25) companies that trade or are quoted on the OTC Markets, (ii) having stock prices ranging from $0.01 to $5.15, (iii) with aggregate
values of the securities held by the Company ranging from $1,930 to $900,000. The Designated Assets consist of (a) 24 issuers’ common stock and (b) one (1) issuer’s convertible
debt instrument that is convertible into common stock.
During
the fourth quarter and portion of the third quarter of 2021, we sold an aggregate of approximately $680,000 of the Designated Assets.
On January 30, 2022, we distributed the net proceeds from those shares to holders of our Series A Preferred Shares. Pursuant to the distribution,
each holder of Series A Preferred Stock received approximately $0.01 per share.
As
of December 31, 2021, the Designated Assets had a market value of $3,925,000.
During the first quarter of 2022, we sold
an aggregate of Designated Assets with a cost basis of $384,000 and generated proceeds of $268,000, which paid the dividend declared during
the fourth quarter 2021. The sale of Designated Assets did not result in sufficient proceeds to declare a distribution pursuant to the
terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and there was no distribution declared during the first quarter of 2022.
As
of March 31, 2022, the Designated Assets had a market value of $3.2 million and the Company was holding cash for distribution of $0.6
million.
The
Designated Assets consist of securities (i) from twenty three (23) companies that trade or are quoted on the OTC Markets, (ii) having
quoted stock prices ranging from $0.001 to $7.07, (iii) with aggregate values of the securities held by us ranging from $0 to $750,000,
and (iv) with an average value equal to $140,000 per issuer.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
There have been no changes to our critical accounting
policies during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Critical accounting policies and the significant estimates in accordance with such
policies are regularly discussed with our Audit Committee. Those policies are discussed under Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, in the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 12, 2022 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) as of March 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report
on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial
Officer (principal financial officer) have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable
assurance level at March 31, 2022 because the Company has not yet completed its remediation of the material weaknesses previously identified
and disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, the end of its most recent fiscal
year.
Specifically,
management has determined the following:
●
a lack of internal
valuation experts;
●
a lack of sufficient in-house
qualified accounting staff;
●
a lack of validation of
completeness and accuracy of internally prepared data, including key reports generated from systems, utilized in the operations of
controls, leading to delays in the Company’s closing process;
●
inadequate controls and
segregation of duties due to limited resources and number of employees;
●
lack of internal personnel
to properly evaluate the fair value and the associated revenue recognition related to our non-cash revenue contracts;
●
substantial reliance on
manual reporting processes and spreadsheets external to the accounting system for financial reporting leading to delays in the Company’s
closing process;
●
lack of adequate controls
in the accounting for internally developed software costs; products and services; and the recording of sophisticated, material financing
transactions which are heavily dependent upon the use of estimates and assumptions and require us using consultants;
●
and our lack of experience
in monitoring and administering, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
In
addition to the material weaknesses noted above, we noted the following deficiencies that we believe to be material weaknesses:
●
Fair Value
Measurements: deficiencies in the design of this control and excessive reliance on the work of a third party specialist resulted
in undetected errors in the valuation of certain positions that results in adjustments.
●
Earnings per share; deficiencies
in the design of this control resulted in preparation errors that were not prevented or detected.
Our
management concluded that considering internal control deficiencies that, in the aggregate, rise to the level of material weaknesses,
we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022 based on the criteria set forth in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
To
mitigate the items identified in the assessment, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of
legal and accounting professionals/consultants. As we grow, we expect to increase the number of employees, which would enable us to implement
adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework.
Remediation
We
are continuing to seek ways to remediate these weaknesses, which stem from our small workforce and limited resources. Beginning with
the quarter ended March 31, 2022, the Company has hired a third party valuation company to perform the valuation of the Company’s
marketable securities.
Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations
of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Controls and procedures can only
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and
procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other
than the changes noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March
31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.
Please
consider the following risk factors carefully. If any one or more of the following risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities could decrease
significantly. Statements below to the effect that an event could or would harm our business (or have an adverse effect on our business
or similar statements) mean that the event could or would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition,
and results of operations, which in turn could or would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Although
we have organized the risk factors below under headings to make them easier to read, many of the risks we face involve more than one
type of risk. Consequently, you should read all the risk factors below carefully before making any decision to acquire or hold our securities.
Risks
Related to our Business
We
have a history of operating losses and there are no assurances we will report profitable operations in the foreseeable future.
For
the years-ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported loss from operations of $85,000 and $7,032,000, respectively, and
accumulated deficits of $30,355,000 and $50,342,000, respectively. Additionally, for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022
and 2021, we reported we reported (loss) income from operations of ($1,328,000) and $425,000, respectively, and an accumulated
deficit of $26,627,000 at March 31, 2022. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to grow our revenues, contain our
operating expenses and generate profits. We do not have any long-term agreements with our customers. There are no assurances that we
will be able to increase our revenues and cash flow to a level which supports profitable operations. We may continue to incur losses
in future periods until such time, if ever, as we are successful in significantly increasing our revenues and cash flow beyond what
is necessary to fund our ongoing operations and pay our obligations as they become due. If we significantly increase our revenues in
future periods, the rapid growth may strain our organization and we may encounter difficulties in maintaining the quality of our
operations. If we are not able to successfully increase our revenues, it is unlikely we will be able to generate sufficient cash
from operations to pay our operating expenses and service our debt obligations or report profitable operations in future
periods.
Our
auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our
auditors’ report on our December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements expresses an opinion that our capital resources as
of the date of their audit report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year
unless we raised additional funds. Based upon our cash position on March 31, 2022, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern beyond twelve months from the filing of this quarterly report. Our ability to continue as a going concern is based
on several factors; (i) our ability to sustain our current operating performance, and (ii) our ability to raise additional capital. If
we are not successful with either of these, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and may cease operation or seek bankruptcy
protection.
We
may need to raise additional capital to pay our indebtedness as it comes due.
In
June 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors for the issuance of approximately $16.1 million
in principal of debentures, of which $1.3 million remains outstanding as of March 31, 2022. In July 2022, we amended certain terms of
the debentures whereby in exchange for an additional five percent (5%) to be added onto the outstanding principal, we extended the maturity
dates by six (6) months or until December 31, 2023 as well as extended the date we are required to begin making amortization payments
until January 1, 2023. In addition, the holders of the debentures have the unilateral right to extend the maturity date and amortization
payments by another six (6) months each in exchange for another additional five percent (5%) to be added to the principal of the debentures.
On
July 1, 2022, we entered into an original issue discount bridge loan in the principal amount of $650,000 pursuant to which we received
$500,000 in cash. On August 8, 2022, the bridge loan was converted into revolving notes as part of a senior secured revolving credit
facility whereby we received $4,930,000 cash on the first draw down. Of the amount received, we used approximately $3.75 million of payoff
and retire outstanding obligations. The repayment of the debentures and revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all the
assets and the intellectual property of the Company.
35
Further,
in addition to payments required pursuant the debentures and revolving credit facility, the lender is also entitled to ten percent (10%)
of the net proceeds of any sales of securities acquired from our customers during the term of the loan. As a result, this will further
negatively impact our cash flows from operations and may require us to raise additional capital earlier than previously anticipated.
Depending on our level of operations, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to repay our obligations under the debentures
or revolving credit facility as they come due. If we are not able to generate enough cashflow through the operation of our business,
we will need to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets, in order to make the required
payments. If we are unable to make the required payments, or if we fail to comply with the various requirements and covenants of the
debentures and revolving credit facility, we will be in default, which would permit the lender to accelerate the maturity and require
immediate repayment of the outstanding principal and interest. In such event, this could lead to potential foreclosure on the assets
securing the debt. If we are unable to refinance or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, including upon an event of default, we
may become insolvent and be unable to continue operations.
Our
outstanding loan obligations contain substantial covenants that may impact our business, our ability to secure additional debt financing,
and our ability to pay our debts as they become due.
As
of December 29, 2022, we have approximately (i) $1.1 million outstanding of our secured convertible debentures issued in June 2020 that
are due and payable on December 31, 2023 and (ii) $5,580,000 of revolving notes outstanding pursuant to our senior secured revolving
credit facility. Each of the debentures and revolving notes / credit facility contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants,
including, but not limited to: reporting requirements, certain financial covenants related to our stock portfolio, collateral limitations,
certain limitations on liens and indebtedness, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, restricted payments and investments, corporate
changes and limitations on waivers and amendments to certain agreements, our organizational documents, etc. Our failure to comply with
the covenants in the credit agreement governing the credit facility and the debentures and associated transaction documents could result
in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt and
potential foreclosure on the assets pledged to secure the debt.
Further,
we agreed to pay the lender in the credit facility, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the net proceeds actually received by us
from the sale any securities of a customer that we acquired during the term of the revolving note(s). Given that we have not yet achieved
profitability, and we will additionally be required to make payments upon the sales of our customer’s securities to the lender,
we may be unable to continue to meet our obligations as they become due. If we are unable to refinance or repay our indebtedness as it
becomes due or upon an event of default, we may become insolvent and be unable to continue operations.
Additionally,
the revolving loan obligations under our secured credit facility provide for variable repayment terms ranging from 10% to 30% of the
net proceeds actually received upon the sale of our customer’s securities that we receive pursuant to the provision of services.
This will further negatively impact our cash flows and may further accelerate the anticipated timeframe in which we need to raise additional
capital.
Our
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, has resulted in the need for us to restate previously
issued financial statements. As a result, current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could
harm our business and value of our stock.
Or
management has determined that, as of March 31, 2022, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based
on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
as a result of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Natural
disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks, trade wars, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations
or those of our development partners, manufacturers, regulators or other third parties with whom we conduct business now or in the future.
A
wide variety of events beyond our control, including natural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks (such as the recent novel
coronavirus outbreak), trade wars, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our manufacturers,
regulatory authorities, or other third parties with whom we conduct business. These events may cause businesses and government agencies
to be shut down, supply chains to be interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and individuals to become ill, quarantined, or otherwise
unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. These limitations could negatively affect our business
operations and continuity, and could negatively impact ability to timely perform basic business functions, including making SEC filings
and preparing financial reports. If our operations or those of third parties with whom we have business are impaired or curtailed as
a result of these events, the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be impaired or halted, which
could have a material adverse impact on our business.
A
pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities or
advisors could adversely impact our business.
If
a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) or other public health crisis were to affect our operations, facilities or those of our customers or suppliers, our business
could be adversely affected. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access
to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only materially impact
our operations, financial condition and demand for our services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this
event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Commission.
Impacts
of the Conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the COVID-19 Pandemic
Russia
invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and is still engaged in active armed conflict against the country. The global COVID-19 pandemic continues
to evolve, and we will continue to monitor developments closely. To date, our financial condition and operations have not been significantly
impacted by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact on our business, operations remains
uncertain and will depend on certain developments, including the actions of U.S. and foreign governments to impose sanctions on Russia,
regulatory agencies, other third parties with whom we do business. We will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation
and may take actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we
determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business.
36
Regulatory,
legislative or self-regulatory developments regarding internet privacy matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.
The
United States and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly
restrict our ability to collect, process, use, transfer and pool data collected from and about consumers and devices. Trade associations
and industry self-regulatory groups have also promulgated best practices and other industry standards relating to targeted advertising.
Various U.S. and foreign governments, self-regulatory bodies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulations specifically
directed at the digital advertising industry, and we expect to see an increase in legislation, regulation and self-regulation in this
area. The legal, regulatory and judicial environment we face around privacy and other matters is constantly evolving and can be subject
to significant change. Additionally, the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are
often uncertain and in flux. Legislative and regulatory authorities around the world may decide to enact additional legislation or regulations,
which could reduce the amount of data we can collect or process and, as a result, significantly impact our business. Similarly, clarifications
of and changes to these existing and proposed laws, regulations, judicial interpretations and industry standards can be costly to comply
with, and we may be unable to pass along those costs to our clients in the form of increased fees, which may negatively affect our operating
results. Such changes can also delay or impede the development of new solutions, result in negative publicity and reputational harm,
require significant incremental management time and attention, increase our risk of non-compliance and subject us to claims or other
remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, including our ability to charge per click or
the scope of clicks for which we charge. Additionally, any perception of our practices or solutions as an invasion of privacy, whether
or not such practices or solutions are consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public
criticism, private class actions, reputational harm or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased
liability. Finally, our legal and financial exposure often depends in part on our clients’ or other third parties’ adherence
to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with visitors’ expectations. We rely on representations
made to us by clients that they will comply with all applicable laws, including all relevant privacy and data protection regulations.
We make reasonable efforts to enforce such representations and contractual requirements, but we do not fully audit our clients’
compliance with our recommended disclosures or their adherence to privacy laws and regulations. If our clients fail to adhere to our
contracts in this regard, or a court or governmental agency determines that we have not adequately, accurately or completely described
our own solutions, services and data collection, use and sharing practices in our own disclosures to consumers, then we and our clients
may be subject to potentially adverse publicity, damages and related possible investigation or other regulatory activity in connection
with our privacy practices or those of our clients.
Unfavorable
media coverage could negatively affect our business.
Unfavorable
publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, terms of service, regulatory activity, the actions of third parties, the use
of our products or services for illicit, objectionable, or illegal ends or the actions of other companies that provide similar services
to us, could adversely affect our reputation. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and
loyalty of our customer base which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our
business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition,
consumer protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could
result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or
engagement, or otherwise harm our business.
We
are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, such as
privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution,
data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer
protection, taxation and securities law compliance. Expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may
take, may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content,
competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.
Additionally,
as we expand our product offerings, we may become subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective as of
May 2018. The GDPR increases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extends the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and
data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who
are located in Europe or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance
can result in penalties of up to the greater of €20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.
These
U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government
authorities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement
of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the newer industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and
applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.
37
These
laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply
with and may delay or impede our international growth, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant
management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business.
Security
breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm
our reputation and adversely affect our business.
Our
industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data or to disrupt our ability
to provide service. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data,
including personal information, content, or payment information from or to users, or information from marketers, could result in the
loss or misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer
malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry.
As a result of recent attention and growth of, the size of our user base, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we
believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks. Our efforts to address undesirable activity may also
increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience,
cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us.
Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical
malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve. In addition,
third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our
users’ data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long
periods of time. Although we are currently in the process of developing systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and
user data, to prevent data loss and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will ultimately become
operational or provide absolute security, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks.
Affected
parties or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security
breaches or improper disclosure of data, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent
decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline
in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation,
or financial results.
If
we were to lose or have limited access to certain platforms or data sources, we will lose our existing revenue from these platform and
sources.
The
loss of access to any platforms or data sources could limit our ability to effectively grow a portion of our operations. Our business
would be harmed if these platforms:
●
discontinues
or limits access to its platform by us and other application developers;
●
modify
terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers, or changes
how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers;
●
establishes
more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors; or
●
develops
its own competitive offerings.
We
depend on the services of our executive officers and the loss of any of their services could harm our ability to operate our business
in future periods.
Our
success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers, including Christopher Miglino, Michael Malone, and Christopher
Lahiji, the president of our wholly owned subsidiary, LD Micro. We are a party to an employment agreement with each of Mr. Miglino, Mr.
Malone and Mr. Lahiji. Although we do not expect to lose their services in the foreseeable future, the loss of any of them could materially
harm our business and operations in future periods until such time as we were able to engage a suitable replacement.
Weak
economic conditions may reduce consumer demand for products and services.
A
weak economy in the United States could adversely affect demand for advertising products, and services. A substantial portion of our
revenue is derived from businesses that are highly dependent on discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times
of economic instability. Accordingly, the ability of our advertisers to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely
affected to the extent that relevant economic environments remain weak or decline further. We currently are unable to predict the extent
of any of these potential adverse effects.
38
Certain
of our business affiliates have operations outside of the United States that are subject to numerous operational risks.
Certain
of our affiliates have operations in countries other than the United States. In many foreign countries, it is not uncommon to encounter
business practices that are prohibited by certain regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. Although certain
of our business affiliates have undertaken compliance efforts with respect to these laws, their respective employees, contractors and
agents, as well as those companies to which they outsource certain of their business operations, may take actions in violation of their
policies and procedures. Any such violation, even if prohibited by the policies and procedures of these business affiliates or the law,
could have certain adverse effects on the financial condition of these business affiliates. Any failure by these affiliates to effectively
manage the challenges associated with the international operation of their businesses could materially adversely affect their, and hence
our, financial condition.
In
the event that we are unable to conduct business with certain third-party providers of data and information integral to our operations,
our revenue and business prospects may suffer.
We
rely on access to certain third-party providers of data in the investment sector in order for the Sequire platform to function and provide
meaningful data and insights for our customers. We have benefited from the data that these third-parties have provided to us on behalf
of their customers. In the event that we lose access to these third-party providers, it would limit our ability to effectively market
the Sequire platform and sell our services to our customers. In the event that these third-party providers change their terms or our
ability to access their data on a cost-effective basis to us, our business may be materially harmed.
Competitors
may create products that compete with the Sequire platform and there can be no assurances that we will be able to protect our intellectual
property related to Sequire.
The
Sequire platform’s success depends heavily on our intellectual property and the continued development and innovation of the platform.
Notwithstanding, there may be competitors seeking to compete by creating similar platforms with more aggressive pricing or lower cost
structures, greater functionality, and by emulating the services provided by the Sequire platform. Furthermore, certain of the information
that we implement in our Sequire platform is either publicly available or ascertained through third-party service providers for which
no barrier to entry exists. Companies with significantly more resources than us may attempt to create competing products at lower prices.
Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we are able to adequately defend our trade secrets or intellectual property rights with
respect to competitors.
Our
insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.
We
may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for
which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do,
and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured
retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future
losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which
may harm our financial condition and operating results.
Risks
Related to receipt of Securities for Services
Many
of the securities we receive for services do not have an active trading market, and we value these securities at fair value as determined
in good faith under procedures adopted by our Board of Directors, which valuation is inherently subjective and may not reflect what we
may actually realize for the sale of these securities.
The
majority of securities comprising our stock portfolio are, and are expected to continue to be, in securities that have a limited market,
limited liquidity, high volatility, and accordingly, their market price may not accurately reflect the true value in the event that they
were traded on an active market. The fair value of assets whose true values are not readily ascertainable are determined in
good faith under procedures adopted by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors utilizes the services of independent third-party
valuation firms in determining the fair value of a portion of the securities we hold. Investment professionals from our investment adviser
also prepare valuations using sources and/or proprietary models depending on the availability of information on our assets and the type
of asset being valued, all in accordance with our valuation policy. Accordingly, the actual value of the securities we received could
be substantially less than we previously estimated.
Because
fair valuations, and particularly fair valuations of securities without efficient markets are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over
short periods of time, and are often based to a large extent on estimates, comparisons and qualitative evaluations of information, it
may be more difficult for investors to value accurately our securities and could lead to undervaluation or overvaluation of our Common
Stock. In addition, the valuation of these types of securities may result in substantial write-downs and earnings volatility.
The
value ascribed to our assets in our financial statements as of a particular date may be materially greater than or less than the value
that would be realized if our assets were to be liquidated as of such date. For example, if we were required to sell a certain asset
or all or a substantial portion of our assets on a particular date, the actual price that we would realize upon the disposition of such
asset or assets could be materially less than the value of such asset or assets as reflected in our financial statements. Volatile market
conditions could also cause reduced liquidity in the market for certain assets, which could result in liquidation values that are materially
less than the values of such assets as reflected in our financial statements.
39
We
run the risk of inadvertently being deemed to be an investment company that is required to register under the Investment Company Act
of 1940.
We
run the risk of inadvertently being deemed to be an investment company that is required to register under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) because a significant portion of our assets consists of securities in companies in
which we own less than a majority interest. The risk varies depending on events beyond our control, such as significant appreciation
or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of
certain of our subsidiaries, and transactions involving the sale of certain assets. If we are deemed to be an inadvertent investment
company, we may seek to rely on a safe-harbor under the Investment Company Act that would provide us a one-year grace period to take
steps to avoid being deemed to be an investment company. In order to ensure we avoid being deemed an investment company, we have taken,
and may need to continue to take, steps to reduce the percentage of our assets that constitute investment assets under the Investment
Company Act. These steps have included, among others, selling marketable securities that we might otherwise hold for the long-term and
deploying our cash in non-investment assets. We have recently sold marketable securities, including at times at a loss, and we may be
forced to sell our investment assets at unattractive prices or to sell assets that we otherwise believe benefit our business in the future
to remain below the requisite threshold. We may also seek to acquire additional non-investment assets to maintain compliance with the
Investment Company Act, and we may need to incur debt, issue additional equity or enter into other financing arrangements that are not
otherwise attractive to our business. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition. Moreover, we can make no assurance that we would successfully be able to take the necessary steps to avoid being deemed to
be an investment company in accordance with the safe harbor. If we were unsuccessful, then we would have to register as an investment
company, and we would be unable to operate our business in its current form. We would be subject to extensive, restrictive, and potentially
adverse statutory provisions and regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, indebtedness,
dividends, and transactions with affiliates. If we were deemed to be an investment company and did not register as an investment company
when required to do so, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties
or injunctive relief, or both, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, and/or that third parties could seek
to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which we were an unregistered investment company.
We
are not, and do not intend to become, regulated as an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (and similar legislation
in other jurisdictions) and if we are deemed an “investment company” under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable
restrictions would make it impractical for us to operate as contemplated.
The
Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder (and similar legislation in other jurisdictions) provide certain protections to investors
and impose certain restrictions on companies that are registered as investment companies. Among other things, such rules limit or prohibit
transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities and impose certain governance requirements.
We have not been and do not intend to become regulated as an investment company and we intend to conduct our activities so that we will
not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act (and similar legislation in other jurisdictions). In order
to ensure that we are not deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to materially restrict or limit the scope of our operations
or plans related to Sequire, which may limit us in the types of acquisitions that we may make and we may need to modify our organizational
structure or dispose of assets that we would not otherwise dispose of. Moreover, if anything were to happen which would potentially cause
us to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, it would be impractical for us to operate as intended pursuant
to the Sequire platform and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Accordingly,
we would be required to take extraordinary steps to address the situation, such as the modification and restructuring of our Sequire
platform, which would materially adversely affect our ability to derive revenue.
Sequire’s
services are primarily paid for in restricted shares of its customers’ stock, which are often smaller publicly traded companies
with volatile stock prices, limited liquidity, riskier operations and whose securities are frequently quoted on the OTC Markets, which
includes the OTCQX, OTCQB as well as the OTC Pink, which typically quotes securities with increased risk and less liquidity.
Payment
related to our Sequire platform and services is often made through the equity securities of our customers instead of cash. Since larger
companies typically pay in cash, the securities issued are often those of smaller public companies that often have limited operating
histories, limited operating cash, and negative cash flows. Additionally, these securities are primarily restricted, and are subject
to legal holding periods pursuant to Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions. As of March 31, 2022 approximately $22 million of our holdings
are issued by companies whose securities trade on the OTC Markets Inc. Additionally, of these securities quoted on the OTC Markets, approximately
76% are quoted on the OTC Pink. While our agreements for OTC issuers may contain certain provisions providing for the issuance of additional
securities upon certain events, the value of such securities on the date of receipt compared to the date when we are able to legally
sell the securities may decrease significantly, and the stock price of such issuers is often volatile, unpredictable, and with limited
liquidity. Additionally, the OTC Pink has less stringent requirements for listing than even other OTC Markets, such as the OTCQB or OTCQX.
Often, the OTC Pink lists companies that (i) may not be providing current information, (ii) may not have independent directors, (iii)
may have little to no trading, and (iv) may be very volatile. As a result, the value of the equity received on the date of payment may
be significantly greater than the actual revenue derived by us upon a sale of the securities. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that
the companies that we receive securities from will remain solvent or maintain “current information”, or other required criteria
during the legally required holding period under Rule 144, which would result in the loss of some or all of our anticipated revenue.
These risks are significantly increased for OTC Pink issuers. As we are not experienced traders, there can be no assurances that our
personnel responsible for selling the securities will do so at opportune times or be able to maximize profitability.
40
Our
receipt of securities in lieu of cash may be negatively affected by a downturn in the U.S. and/or global securities markets and could
significantly reduce our revenue.
General
political and economic conditions and events such as U.S. fiscal and monetary policies, economic recessions, inflationary events, governmental
shutdowns, trade tensions and disputes, global economic slowdowns, widespread health epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, terrorist
attacks, wars, changes in local and national economic and political conditions, regulatory changes or changes in the laws, or interest
rate or currency rate fluctuations could create a downturn in the U.S. and/or global securities markets. As we often receive restricted
securities of companies, a downturn in the U.S. or global markets may impact such companies and the value of the securities we receive
for services pursuant to the Sequire platform.
Risks
Related to Ownership of our Securities; Listing of our Securities.
Our
Common Stock does not currently meet the continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Market and accordingly is subject to delisting.
On
April 19, 2022, we received a written notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule
5250(c)(1), because we had not yet filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1)
requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic reports with the SEC. Pursuant to Nasdaq rules, we have 60 calendar days
from the date of the notification letter, or until June 20, 2022, to file the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, in May and
August of 2022, we received additional written notices from Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1)
because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
As
previously disclosed, on October 14, 2022, the Staff notified the Company that, based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance
with the Filing Requirement, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting unless the Company timely requested a hearing before
the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). The Company timely requested a hearing and, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule
5815(a)(1)(B), a stay of any further suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq, which was subsequently granted. At the hearing, the Company
will present its plan to regain compliance with the Filing Requirement and request an extension to file all outstanding periodic reports
with the SEC.
Subsequently,
on November 16, 2022, we received an additional notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq
that the Company’s failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2022 with the SEC
could serve as an additional basis for delisting under Nasdaq Listing rule 5250(c)(1).
On
October 12, 2022, the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the SEC; however, the Company
has not yet filed its Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022.
On
October 27, 2022, the Company engaged Marcum LLP (“Marcum”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm for the year ending December 31, 2022. The Company is diligently working to complete and file the delinquent reports with the SEC
and thereby regain compliance as soon as practicable. Nasdaq previously provided the Company with an extension of one hundred eighty
(180) days from the initial due date of the 2021 Form 10-K or until October 12, 2022, to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued
listing rule as it relates to all of the untimely filings. Accordingly, the Company’s (i) March 30, 2022 Form 10-Q, and (ii) June
30, 2022 and (iii) September 30, 2022 Form 10-Q are all required to be filed with the SEC by February 28, 2023.
If
our shares lose their status on the Nasdaq Market, we believe that our shares would likely be eligible to be quoted on the inter-dealer
electronic quotation and trading system operated by OTC Markets Group, commonly referred to as the over-the-counter market. These markets
are generally considered not to be as efficient as, and not as broad as, the Nasdaq Market. If our common stock is delisted, this would,
among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest
and fewer development opportunities for us.
Conversions
of our convertible debentures, notes issued under our revolving credit facility, and the exercise of our common stock warrants may dilute
the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
The
conversion of some or all of the outstanding convertible debentures or the revolving note issued in our secured revolving credit facility
would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such
conversion or exercise of outstanding warrants could adversely affect their prevailing market prices. In addition, the existence of the
convertible debentures, revolving note, and outstanding warrants may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion
of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of such debentures into shares of our common stock
could depress the price of our common stock.
41
The
market price of our common stock may be volatile.
The
market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our
share price will continue to be more volatile than those of a seasoned issuer. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a
number of factors. Mainly however, we are a speculative or “risky” investment due to our limited operating history, lack
of significant revenues to date, our continued operating losses and missed guidance. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse
investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined
to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer.
Additionally, in the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of
volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could
result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.
The
trading price of the shares of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response
to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section
and elsewhere in this quarterly report, these factors include:
●
the
success of competitive products;
●
actual
or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;
●
announcements
by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;
●
regulatory
or legal developments in the United States and other countries;
●
the
recruitment or departure of key personnel;
●
the
level of expenses;
●
actual
or anticipated changes in estimates to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;
●
variations
in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
●
fluctuations
in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us
●
inconsistent
trading volume levels of our shares;
●
announcement
or expectation of additional financing efforts;
●
sales
of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;
●
additional
issuances of securities upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants;
●
market
conditions in the technology sectors; and
●
general
economic, industry and market conditions.
In
addition, the stock market in general, and advertising technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry
factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of
any of these risks could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of the shares of our common stock.
42
The
Revolving Note issued under our senior secured revolving credit facility contains an adjustment to the price at which the note can be
converted into our common stock, which may result in further dilution to our shareholders.
The
revolving notes issued in our August 2022 secured revolving credit facility, of which $1.3 million in principal and interest is currently
outstanding, is convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $15.00 per share (the “Conversion Price”). Notwithstanding,
the Conversion Price is subject to adjustment upon certain enumerated events which includes the sale of our common stock or equivalents
at a deemed price equal to or less than $5.00 per share. On December 28, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $1.17 per share.
In the event that we are required to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity or debt securities, given our current market
price, it is likely that the Conversion Price would be adjusted, and we may be required to issue a significantly greater number of shares
upon conversion, than currently anticipated, resulting in greater dilution to our existing shareholders.
We
may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.
The
market price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market
price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in
the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other
business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. To the extent that any claims or suits are brought against us and successfully
concluded, we could be materially adversely affected, jeopardizing our ability to operate successfully. Furthermore, our human and capital
resources could be adversely affected by the need to defend any such actions, even if we are ultimately successful in our defense.
Failure
to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline
in our stock price.
We
have previously provided, and may provide in the future, public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods. Although
we believe that this guidance provides investors with a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future and is
useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks
and uncertainties. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided. For example, in the past,
we have missed guidance a number of times. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or if we reduce
our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.
Delaware
law contains anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.
Provisions
of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of our company and the removal of incumbent officers and
directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring us, without our
board of directors’ consent, for at least three years from the date they first hold 15% or more of the voting stock.
If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading
price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.
The
trading market for our shares of our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts
publish about us or our business. A small number of securities and industry analysts currently publish research regarding our Company
on a limited basis. In the event that one or more of the securities or industry analysts who have initiated coverage downgrade our securities
or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our shares of common stock would likely decline. If one
or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease,
which might cause the trading price of our shares of common stock and trading volume to decline.
The
elimination of monetary liability against our directors and officers under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held
by our directors and officers may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors and officers.
Our
certificate of incorporation eliminates the personal liability of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders for
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent permissible under Delaware law. Further, our bylaws provide
that we are obligated to indemnify any of our directors or officers to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law. We are also parties
to separate indemnification agreements with certain of our directors and our officers which, subject to certain conditions, require us
to advance the expenses incurred by any director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding prior to its final disposition.
Those indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage
awards against our directors or officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage
us from bringing a lawsuit against any of our current or former directors or officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may
similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even if such actions,
if successful, might otherwise benefit us or our stockholders.
