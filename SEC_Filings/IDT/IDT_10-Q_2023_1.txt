IDT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note
1— Basis of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of IDT Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or “IDT”)
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the
three and six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending
July 31, 2023. The balance sheet at July 31, 2022 has been derived from the Company’s audited financial statements at that
date but does not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. For further
information, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The
Company’s fiscal year ends on July 31 of each calendar year. Each reference below to a fiscal year refers to the fiscal year
ending in the calendar year indicated (e.g., fiscal 2023 refers to the fiscal year ending July 31, 2023).
Note
2— Business Segment Information
As
of August 1, 2022, the Company revised its reportable business segments primarily to reflect the growth of its financial technology businesses
and their increased contributions to the Company’s consolidated results. The Company’s
four
reportable business segments,
Fintech, National Retail Solutions (“NRS”), net2phone, and Traditional Communications, reflect management’s current
approach to analyzing results, its resource allocation strategy, and its assessment of business performance. NRS was previously included
in the Company’s Fintech segment. In addition, certain lines of business were reclassified to the Fintech segment from the Traditional
Communications segment. Comparative segment information has been reclassified and restated in all periods to conform to the current period
presentation.
The
Company’s reportable segments are distinguished by types of service, customers, and methods used to provide their services. The
operating results of these business segments are regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as the accounting policies of the Company as a whole. There are no significant asymmetrical allocations
to segments. The Company evaluates the performance of its business segments based primarily on income (loss) from operations.
The Fintech segment is comprised of BOSS Money, a provider of international money remittance and related value/payment transfer services,
as well as other, significantly smaller financial services businesses, including Leaf Global Fintech Corporation (“Leaf”),
a provider of digital wallet services in emerging markets, the Company’s variable interest entity (“VIE”) that operates
money transfer businesses (see Note 9), and IDT Financial Services Limited (“IDT Financial Services”), the Company’s
Gibraltar-based bank.
The NRS segment is an operator of a nationwide point of sale (“POS”) network providing independent retailers with store management software with credit, debit,
and other electronic payment processing, as well as with other ancillary merchant services. NRS’ POS platform provides marketers
with digital out-of-home advertising and transaction data.
The net2phone segment is comprised of net2phone’s cloud communications offerings.
The Traditional Communications segment includes Mobile Top-Up, which enables customers to transfer airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging,
and data to international and domestic mobile accounts, BOSS Revolution Calling, an international long-distance calling service marketed
primarily to immigrant communities in the United States and Canada, and IDT Global, a wholesale provider of international voice and SMS
termination and outsourced traffic management solutions to telecoms worldwide. Traditional Communications also includes other small
businesses and offerings including early-stage business initiatives and mature businesses in harvest mode.
Corporate
costs mainly include compensation, consulting fees, treasury, tax and accounting services, human resources, corporate purchasing, corporate
governance including Board of Directors’ fees, internal and external audit, investor relations, corporate insurance, corporate

Remaining Performance Obligations
The
Company does not have any significant revenue from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous reporting periods.
The Company’s remaining performance obligations at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 primarily had an original expected duration
of one year or less.
Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances
The
timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to the Company’s customers. Trade accounts receivable in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets represent unconditional rights to consideration. The Company would record a contract asset
when revenue is recognized in advance of its right to bill and receive consideration. The Company has not identified any contract assets.
Contract
liabilities arise when the Company receives consideration or bills its customers prior to providing the goods or services promised in
the contract. The Company’s contract liability balance is primarily payments received for prepaid BOSS Revolution Calling. Contract
liabilities are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. The contract liability balances are presented in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets as “Deferred revenue”.

Deferred Customer Contract Acquisition and Fulfillment Costs
The
Company recognizes its incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer that it expects to recover as an asset. The Company’s
incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are sales commissions paid to employees and third parties on sales to end users.
If the amortization period would be one year or less for the asset that would be recognized from deferring these costs, the Company applies
the practical expedient whereby the Company charges these costs to expense when incurred. For net2phone sales, the Company defers these
costs and amortizes them over the expected customer relationship period when it is expected to exceed one year.
The
Company’s costs to fulfill its contracts do not meet the criteria to be recognized as an asset, therefore these costs are charged
to expense as incurred.
The
Company’s deferred customer contract acquisition costs were as follows:

4— Leases
The
Company’s leases primarily consist of operating leases for office space. These leases have remaining terms from less than
one year
to
five years . net2phone also has operating leases for office equipment. Certain of these leases contain renewal options that may be exercised
and/or options to terminate the lease. The Company has concluded that it is not reasonably certain that it would exercise any of these options.
net2phone
is the lessee under equipment leases that are classified as finance leases. The assets and liabilities related to these finance leases are
not material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
The
Company leases office and parking space in a building and parking garage located at 520 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey that was
previously owned by the Company’s former subsidiary, Rafael Holdings, Inc. (“Rafael”). On August 22, 2022, Rafael
sold the building and parking garage to an unrelated third party. The Company’s lease in that building continues with the new
owner. The Company leases office space in Israel from Rafael. Howard S. Jonas, the Chairman of the Company (an executive officer
position) and the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Executive
Chairman of Rafael.
The
Newark lease expires in April 2025 and the Israel lease expires in July 2025.
In the three and six months ended January 31,
2023, the Company incurred lease costs of $ 32,000
and $ 0.2
million, respectively, in connection with the Rafael leases, which excludes Newark lease costs after August 22, 2022. In the three

series C convertible preferred stock and additional shares of the EMI’s series B convertible preferred stock. The initial shares
purchased represented
23.95 % of the outstanding shares of the EMI on an as converted basis. The subsequent purchases increased the Company’s
ownership to
26.57 % on an as converted basis.
The
Company accounts for this investment using the equity method since the series B and series C convertible preferred stock are in-substance
common stock, and the Company can exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the EMI.
The
Company determined that on the dates of the acquisitions, there were differences of $ 3.4
million and $ 1.0
million between its investment
in the EMI and its proportional interest in the equity of the EMI, which represented the share of the EMI’s customer list on the
dates of the acquisitions attributed to the Company’s interest in the EMI.
These basis differences are being amortized over the
6-year estimated life of the customer list.
In the accompanying consolidated statements of income, amortization of equity method
basis difference is included in the equity in the net loss of investee, which is recorded in “Other income (expense), net” (see Note
17).
As
of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company was the holder of secured promissory notes made by the EMI in exchange for loans of an aggregate
of $ 3.7
million and $ 2.5
million, respectively. The notes provide for interest on the principal amount at
15 %
per annum payable monthly. The notes were due and payable in
February
2023 . The Company, the EMI, and the EMI’s other lenders are in the process of converting all the EMI’s equity and
promissory notes into new shares of the EMI’s participating preferred stock. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the
notes were included in “Other current assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company paid an aggregate of $ 0.4
million in contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions.
In addition, in the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company determined that the requirements for a portion of the contingent consideration
payments related to the acquisition of Leaf would not be met, and, in the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company determined

date. The Company recorded gains of $ 1.6
million and $ 0.3
million on the write-off of these contingent consideration payment obligations,
which were included in “Other operating gain (expense), net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. There
were no other changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.
18
Fair
Value of Other Financial Instruments
The
estimated fair value of the Company’s other financial instruments was determined using available market information or other appropriate
valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting these data to develop estimates of fair value. Consequently,
the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange.
Cash
and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other current assets, customer deposits, and other current liabilities.
At
January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities approximated fair value because of the short
period of time to maturity. The fair value estimates for cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents were classified
as Level 1 and other current assets, customer deposits, and other current liabilities were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Other
assets and other liabilities.
At January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities approximated
fair value. The fair values were estimated based on the Company’s assumptions, which were classified as Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.
Note
9— Variable Interest Entity
The
Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE that operates money transfer businesses. The Company determined that, effective May 31, 2021,
it had the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, and the Company has the
obligation to absorb losses of and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to it. As a result,
the Company consolidates the VIE. The Company does not currently own any interest in the VIE and thus the net income incurred by the
VIE was attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
The
VIE’s net income (loss) and aggregate funding (repaid to) provided by the Company were as

11— Revolving Credit Facility
The
Company’s subsidiary, IDT Telecom, Inc. (“IDT Telecom”), entered into a credit agreement, dated as of May 17,
2021, with TD Bank, N.A. for a revolving credit facility for up to a maximum principal amount of $ 25.0
million. IDT Telecom may use the proceeds to finance working capital requirements and for certain closing costs of the facility. At
January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, there were
no
amounts outstanding under this facility. In the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, IDT Telecom borrowed and repaid an aggregate of $ 2.4
million and $ 2.5
million,
respectively, under the facility.
The revolving credit facility is secured by primarily all of IDT Telecom’s assets. The
principal outstanding bears interest per annum at the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration Ltd. LIBOR multiplied by
the Regulation D maximum reserve requirement plus 125 to 175 basis points, depending upon IDT Telecom’s leverage ratio as
computed for the most recent fiscal quarter. Interest is payable monthly, and all outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid
interest is due on May 16, 2024. IDT Telecom pays a quarterly unused commitment fee on the average daily balance of the unused
portion of the $ 25.0
million commitment of 30 to 85 basis points, depending upon IDT Telecom’s leverage ratio as computed for the most recent
fiscal quarter.
IDT Telecom is required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants as well as maintain certain
targets based on financial ratios during the term of the revolving credit facility. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, IDT
Telecom was in compliance with all of the covenants.

Stock
Issued to Certain Executive Officers for Bonus Payments
In
the six months ended January 31, 2023, certain executive officers of the Company received performance bonuses for fiscal 2022 of an aggregate
of $ 1.2
million, of which one-half was paid in cash and one-half was paid in shares of the Company’s Class B common stock. The
Company issued
24,543
shares of its Class B common stock with an issue date value of $ 0.6
million for the bonus payments.
2015
Stock Option and Incentive Plan
On
December 14, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan
to increase the number of shares of the Company’s Class B common stock available for the grant of awards thereunder by an
additional
50,000
shares.
In
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company received cash from the exercise of stock options of $ 0.2
million, for which the Company
issued
12,500
shares of its Class B common stock. There were
no
stock option exercises in the six months ended January 31, 2022.
In
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company granted
15,000
shares of its Class B common stock to an employee. The Company recorded
stock-based compensation expense and an increase in “Additional paid-in capital” of $ 0.4
million for this grant, which was
the fair value of the shares on the grant date.
Stock
Repurchases
The
Company has an existing stock repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors for the repurchase of shares of the Company’s
Class B common stock. The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
8.0
million shares in the aggregate. In the six months
ended January 31, 2023, the Company repurchased
203,436
shares of its Class B common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.0
million.
There were no repurchases under the program in the six months ended January 31, 2022. At January 31, 2023,
5.0
million shares remained
available for repurchase under the stock repurchase program.
In
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid $ 0.3
million and $ 9.0
million, respectively, to repurchase
13,403
and
200,438
shares, respectively, of the Company’s Class B common stock that were tendered by employees of the Company to satisfy the
employees’ tax withholding obligations in connection with shares issued for bonus payments, the vesting of deferred stock units
(“DSUs”), and lapsing of restrictions on restricted stock. Such shares were repurchased by the Company based on their fair
market value as of the close of business on the trading day immediately prior to the vesting date.
Deferred
Stock Units Equity Incentive Program
On
November 30, 2022, the Company adopted an equity incentive program (under its 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan) in the form of
grants of DSUs that, upon vesting, will entitle the grantees to receive shares of the Company’s Class B common stock. On
December 5, 2022, the Company granted
187,975
DSUs to certain of its executive officers and other employees. Subject to continued full time employment or other service to the
Company, the DSUs are scheduled to vest in three equal amounts on each of May 17, 2023, February 21, 2024, and February 25, 2025.
The number of shares that will be issuable on each vesting date will vary between 50% to 200% of the number of DSUs that vest on
that vesting date, depending on the market price for the underlying Class B common stock on the vesting date relative to the price
approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 25.45
per share (which was based on the market
price at the time of the grant). In addition, the grantee will have the right to elect a later vesting date no later than April 14,
2023 for the May 17, 2023 vesting date, and no later than January 19, 2024 for the February 21, 2024 vesting date. A grantee will
have the option to elect a later vesting date for one-half or all of the shares scheduled to vest on the then upcoming vesting date
and any DSUs that do not vest based on the grantee’s election, will be eligible to vest on the subsequent scheduled vesting
date. The Company estimated that the fair value of the DSUs on the date of grant was $ 5.1
million, which is being recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods ending in February 2025. The Company
used a risk neutral Monte Carlo simulation method in its valuation of the DSUs, which simulated the range of possible future values
of the Company’s Class B common stock over the life of the DSUs.
The weighted average grant date fair value per DSU was
$ 27.20 .
At January 31, 2023, there was $ 4.2
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested DSUs.
The
Company had an existing equity incentive program in the form of DSUs that, upon vesting, entitled the grantees to receive shares of the
Company’s Class B common stock. On January 5, 2022, the third and final vesting date under the program, the Company issued
301,296
shares of its Class B common stock in respect of DSUs that vested on that date.

Note
13— Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
On
September 29, 2021, NRS sold shares of its Class B common stock representing
2.5 % of its outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted
basis to Alta Fox Opportunities Fund LP (“Alta Fox”) for cash of $ 10
million. Alta Fox has the right to request that NRS
redeem all or any portion of the NRS common shares that it purchased at the per share purchase price during a period of 182 days following
the fifth anniversary of this transaction. The redemption right shall terminate upon the consummation of (i) a sale of NRS or its assets
for cash or securities that are listed on a national securities exchange, (ii) a public offering of NRS’ securities, or (iii) a
distribution of NRS’ capital stock following which NRS’ common shares are listed on a national securities exchange.
The
shares of NRS’ Class B common stock sold to Alta Fox have been classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets because they may be redeemed at the option of Alta Fox, although the shares are not mandatorily redeemable. The carrying
amount of the shares includes the noncontrolling interest in the net income of NRS. The net income attributable to the mezzanine equity’s
noncontrolling interest during the periods were as follows:

Earnings Per Share
Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to all classes of common stockholders of the Company by the weighted
average number of shares of all classes of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed
in the same manner as basic earnings per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include restricted stock still subject
to risk of forfeiture and to assume exercise of potentially dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method, unless the effect
of such increase is anti-dilutive.
The

offices on a hybrid basis. The Company’s salespeople, customer service employees, technicians, and delivery employees continue
to serve its independent retailers, channel partners, and customers with minimal interruption.
COVID-19
had mixed financial impacts on the Company beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing through the third quarter of
fiscal 2022.
Legal
Proceedings
On
April 24, 2018, Sprint Communications Company L.P. filed a patent infringement claim against the Company and certain of its affiliates
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,298,064; 6,330,224; 6,343,084; 6,452,932;
6,463,052; 6,473,429; 6,563,918; 6,633,561; 6,697,340; 6,999,463; 7,286,561; 7,324,534; 7,327,728; 7,505,454; and 7,693,131. Plaintiff
was seeking damages and injunctive relief. On June 28, 2018, Sprint dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The Company is evaluating
the underlying claim, and at this stage, is unable to estimate its potential liability, if any. The Company intends to vigorously defend
any claim of infringement of the listed patents.
On
July 5, 2017, plaintiff JDS1, LLC, on behalf of itself and all other similarly situated stockholders of Straight Path, and
derivatively on behalf of Straight Path as nominal defendant, filed a putative class action and derivative complaint in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company, The Patrick Henry Trust (a trust formed by Howard S. Jonas that held record
and beneficial ownership of certain shares of Straight Path he formerly held), Howard S. Jonas, and each of Straight Path’s
directors. The complaint alleges that the Company aided and abetted Straight Path Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Davidi Jonas, and Howard S. Jonas in his capacity as controlling stockholder of Straight Path, in breaching their fiduciary duties
to Straight Path in connection with the settlement of claims between Straight Path and the Company related to potential
indemnification claims concerning Straight Path’s obligations under the Consent Decree it entered into with the Federal
Communications Commission (“FCC”), as well as the sale of Straight Path’s subsidiary Straight Path IP Group, Inc.
to the Company in connection with that settlement. That action was consolidated with a similar action that was initiated by The
Arbitrage Fund. The Plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, (i) a declaration that the action may be maintained as a class
action or in the alternative, that demand on the Straight Path Board is excused; (ii) that the term sheet is invalid; (iii) awarding
damages for the unfair price stockholders received in the merger between Straight Path and Verizon Communications Inc. for their
shares of Straight Path’s Class B common stock; and (iv) ordering Howard S. Jonas, Davidi Jonas, and the Company to disgorge
any profits for the benefit of the class Plaintiffs. On August 28, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On September 24,
2017, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which was ultimately denied, and which denial was affirmed by the
Delaware Supreme Court. On February 17, 2022, the court denied the Company’s motion for summary judgment. On March 10, 2022,
JDS1, LLC withdrew its application to serve as class representative and lead plaintiff. On May 16, 2022, the court denied The
Arbitrage Fund’s motion to serve as class representative and lead plaintiff, and approved intervenor Ardell Howard’s
motion to serve as class representative. The trial commenced on August 29, 2022 for a period of five days, followed by another
five-day period in December 2022. The parties are in the midst of post-trial briefing. Closing statements are scheduled to take
place in May 2023. The Company is vigorously defending this matter (see Note 10). At this stage, the Company is unable to estimate
its potential liability, if any.
In
addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
have not been finally adjudicated. Although there can be no assurance in this regard, the Company believes that none of the other legal
proceedings to which the Company is a party will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows
or financial condition.

Sales
Tax Contingency
On
June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., holding that a state may require
a remote seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax on goods and services provided to purchasers in
the state, overturning certain existing court precedent. It is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that the
Company has liability for periods for which it has not collected sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions
were successful it could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and operating results. One
or more jurisdictions may change their laws or policies to apply their sales, use or other similar taxes to the Company’s operations,
and if such changes were made it could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and operating
results.
Regulatory
Fees Audit
The
Company’s 2017 FCC Form 499-A, which reports its calendar year 2016 revenue, was audited by the Universal Service
Administrative Company (“USAC”). The Internal Audit Division of USAC issued preliminary audit findings and the Company,
in accordance with USAC’s audit procedures, appealed certain of the findings. USAC issued a final decision, and the final
decision overturned one of the initial findings but left the remaining initial findings in place. The reversal will result in the
elimination of a $ 1.8
million charge by the Universal Service Fund. The final decision upheld the imposition of a $ 2.9
million charge to the Federal
Telecommunications Fund. The Company intends to appeal the USAC’s final decision to the FCC, and does not intend to remit
payment for the Federal Telecommunications Fund fees unless and until a negative decision on its appeal has been issued. In response to the aforementioned
preliminary audit findings, the Company made certain changes to its filing policies and procedures for years that remain potentially
under audit. At January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company’s accrued expenses included $ 31.4
million and $ 33.2
million, respectively, for FCC-related regulatory fees for the year covered by the audit, as well as prior and subsequent
years.
Purchase
Commitments
At
January 31, 2023, the Company had purchase commitments of $ 5.9
million primarily for equipment and services.
Performance
Bonds
The
Company has performance bonds issued through third parties for the benefit of various states in order to comply with the states’
financial requirements for money remittance licenses and telecommunications resellers. At January 31, 2023, the Company had aggregate
performance bonds of $ 24.2
million outstanding.

At
January 31, 2023, the Company’s best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for fiscal 2023 was
27.7 %
compared to
16.9 %
at July 31, 2022. The changes in the estimated
effective tax rate were mainly due to stock-based compensation and
differences in the amount of taxable income earned in the various taxing jurisdictions.

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) ,
Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,
that clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of
the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also requires specific disclosures related to
equity securities that are subject to contractual sales restrictions. The Company will adopt the amendments in this ASU prospectively
on August 1, 2024. The Company is evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In

Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) ,
Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments,
that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For receivables,
loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking current expected credit loss model that generally
will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities
will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice, except the losses will be recognized as allowances instead of reductions
in the amortized cost of the securities. In addition, an entity will have to disclose significantly more information about allowances,
credit quality indicators, and past due securities. The new provisions will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings. The Company will adopt the new standard on August 1, 2023. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material

Results
of Operations
We
evaluate the performance of our business segments based primarily on income (loss) from operations. Accordingly, the income and expense
line items below income (loss) from operations are only included in our discussion of the consolidated results of operations.
Coronavirus
Disease (COVID-19)
We
continue to monitor and respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including our customers, employees,
suppliers, vendors, and business partners.
Operationally,
our employees transitioned to work-from-home during the third quarter of fiscal 2020.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain of our employees returned to work in our offices on a hybrid basis. Our salespeople,
customer service employees, technicians, and delivery employees continue to serve our independent retailers, channel partners, and customers
with minimal interruption.
25
COVID-19
has had mixed financial impacts on our businesses beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing through the third quarter
of fiscal 2022. It drove increases in demand for our consumer offerings, principally BOSS Money, BOSS Revolution Calling and Mobile Top-Up,
through our digital channels beginning in the latter half of March 2020. Subsequently, digital transaction levels have continued to increase
relative to retailer originated transactions. Correspondingly, sales of consumer offerings originating through retailers and channel
partners slowed modestly in late March and April 2020 before stabilizing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. COVID-19-related demand
slowed the rate of decline in BOSS Revolution Calling revenue that we had experienced in prior periods, however, that impact was less
significant beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2021, and the surge in demand for
voice calls that began with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had eroded by the third quarter of fiscal 2022. National Retail Solutions,
or NRS, was immaterially impacted by the closure of some of its retailers in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, but most re-opened quickly
and many attracted increased foot traffic following the onset of COVID-19 as local retailers were typically more accessible to pedestrian
traffic than big box retailers. The resilience of local retailers has enabled NRS to continue to expand sales of terminals, payment processing,
and advertising services. IDT Global’s revenue, which had been declining as communications globally transition away from traditional
international long-distance voice, declined more rapidly following the onset of COVID-19 as business communications shifted from calling
to video conferencing and other collaboration platforms.
At
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the transition from offices to a more flexible workforce increased the demand for net2phone’s
offerings. Customers transitioned from their on-premises phone system to net2phone’s cloud solution, ported their phone numbers,
and quickly set-up their employees to work remotely. In April 2020, the release of Huddle, net2phone’s integrated video conferencing
solution, significantly improved net2phone’s functionality for remote work, which also increased the demand for its services. COVID-19
had mixed financial impacts on net2phone’s business beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Its customer base growth slowed
somewhat in the second half of fiscal 2020 in certain Latin American markets due to decreased levels of economic activity in those markets.
However, Latin American sales rebounded in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and sales have remained strong in its United States and Canadian
markets.
As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, including the impact of COVID-19, we expect that our cash from operations and the balance of cash,
cash equivalents, debt securities, and current equity investments that we held on January 31, 2023 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the twelve-month period ending January 31, 2024. However, the situation remains
fluid and we cannot predict with certainty the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition,
and cash flows.
Explanation
of Performance Metrics
Our
results of operations discussion include the following performance metrics:
● for
NRS, active point of sale, or POS, terminals, payment processing accounts, and recurring
revenue,
● for
net2phone, seats and subscription revenue, and
● for
Traditional Communications, minutes of use.
NRS
uses two key metrics, among others, to measure the size of its customer base: active POS terminals and payment processing accounts. Active
POS terminals are the number of POS terminals that have completed at least one transaction in the calendar month. It excludes POS terminals
that are being installed. Payment processing accounts are NRS PAY accounts that can generate revenue. It excludes accounts that have
been approved but not activated. NRS’ recurring revenue is NRS’ revenue in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding its revenue
from POS terminal sales.
net2phone’s
cloud communications offerings are priced on a per-seat basis, with customers paying based on the number of users in their organization.
net2phone’s subscription revenue is its revenue in accordance with U.S. GAAP excluding its equipment revenue and revenue generated
by a legacy SIP trunking offering in Brazil.
The
trends and comparisons between periods for the number of active POS terminals, NRS PAY accounts, seats served, recurring revenue, and
subscription revenue are used in the analysis of NRS’ or net2phone’s revenues and direct cost of revenues and are strong
indications of the top-line growth and performance of the business.
Minutes
of use is a nonfinancial metric that measures aggregate customer usage during a reporting period. Minutes of use is an important factor
in BOSS Revolution Calling’s and IDT Global’s revenue recognition since satisfaction of our performance obligation occurs
when the customer uses our service. Minutes of use trends and comparisons between periods are used in the analysis of revenues and direct
cost of revenues.
Three
and Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 Compared to Three and Six Months Ended January 31, 2022
As
of August 1, 2022, we revised our reportable business segments primarily to reflect the growth of our financial technology businesses
and their increased contributions to our consolidated results. Our four reportable business segments, Fintech, NRS, net2phone, and Traditional
Communications, reflect management’s current approach to analyzing results, its resource allocation strategy, and its assessment
of business performance. NRS was previously included in our Fintech segment. In addition, certain lines of business were reclassified
to the Fintech segment from the Traditional Communications segment. Comparative segment information has been reclassified and restated
in all periods to conform to the current period presentation.
26
Fintech
Segment
Fintech,
which represented 6.5% and 4.3% of our total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 6.3% and
4.1% of our total revenues in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is comprised of BOSS Money, a provider of
international money remittance and related value/payment transfer services, as well as other, significantly smaller financial services
businesses, including Leaf Global Fintech Corporation, or Leaf, a provider of digital wallet services in emerging markets, our variable
interest entity, or VIE, that operates money transfer businesses, and IDT Financial Services Limited, or IDT Financial Services, our
Gibraltar-based bank.

Revenues.
Revenues
from BOSS Money increased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022
primarily because of increased transaction volume in BOSS Money’s direct-to-consumer digital and retail channels in the three
and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022. The increase included unusually favorable
economics on certain high-volume African corridors that dissipated late in the three months ended January 31, 2023, as well as the
development and introduction of new platform functionalities enabling more flexible and granular pricing strategies. BOSS Money
continues to benefit from the continued expansion of its disbursement networks, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean.
Direct
Cost of Revenues . Direct cost of revenues increased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods
in fiscal 2022 primarily due to increased direct cost of revenues in BOSS Money’s direct-to-consumer digital and retail channels,
which reflected the increase in BOSS Money’s revenue.
Selling,
General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative expense increased in the three and six months ended January 31,
2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022 primarily due to increases in debit and credit card processing charges, employee
compensation, stock-based compensation expense, and sales commissions. The increase in card processing charges was the result of
increased credit and debit card transactions through our BOSS Money app and other digital channels. As a percentage of
Fintech’s revenue, Fintech’s selling, general and administrative expense decreased to 63.0% from 69.7% in the three
months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and decreased to 59.4% from 67.6% in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively.
Depreciation
and Amortization.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to
the similar periods in fiscal 2022 primarily due to increased depreciation of capitalized costs of consultants and employees developing
internal use software.
Other
Operating Gain.
In the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, Leaf received payments
of $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, from government grants for the development and commercialization of blockchain-backed
financial technologies. In addition, in the six months ended January 31, 2023, we determined that the requirements for a portion of the contingent consideration
payments related to the Leaf acquisition would not be met. We recognized a gain of $1.6 million on the write-off of this contingent consideration
payment obligation.
27
National
Retail Solutions Segment
NRS,
which represented 6.3% and 3.2% of our total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 6.2%
and 2.9% of our total revenues in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is an operator of a nationwide POS
network providing independent retailers with store management software with credit, debit, and other electronic payment processing,
as well as with other ancillary merchant services. NRS’ POS platform provides marketers with digital out-of-home advertising
and transaction data.

Revenues.
net2phone’s
revenues increased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022 driven
primarily by the growth in subscription revenue in the U.S. market. The increase in seats served at January 31, 2023 compared to
January 31, 2022 was led by growth in net2phone’s Latin American markets, and included approximately 9,000 seats from
net2phone’s contact center as a service business.
Direct
Cost of Revenues . Direct cost of revenues increased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods
in fiscal 2022 primarily due to the increase in revenues, with the largest increases in the U.S. market. net2phone’s focus on mid-sized
businesses, multi-channel strategies, and localized offerings generated revenue growth that exceeded the increase in direct cost of revenues.
Selling,
General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative expense increased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023
compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022 primarily due to increases in sales commissions, partially offset by decreases in employee
compensation. As a percentage of net2phone’s revenues, net2phone’s selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
to 78.4% from 96.4% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and decreased to 79.9% from 99.6% in the six months
ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
net2phone
derives a significant portion of its revenues from existing customers. Attracting new customers usually involves additional costs compared
to retention of existing customers. If existing customers’ subscriptions and related usage decrease or are terminated, net2phone
will need to spend more money to acquire new customers and still may not be able to maintain its existing level of revenues or profitability.
In addition, net2phone needs to acquire new customers to increase its revenues. net2phone incurs significant sales and marketing expenses
to acquire new customers. It is therefore expected that selling, general and administrative expenses will remain a significant percentage
of net2phone’s revenues for the foreseeable future.
Depreciation
and Amortization.
The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared
to the similar periods in fiscal 2022 was due to increased depreciation of net2phone’s telephone equipment leased to customers
and increased depreciation of capitalized costs of consultants and employees developing internal use software.
Other
Operating Gain, net.
In the three months ended January 31, 2022, we determined that the requirements for a contingent consideration
payment related to an acquisition in December 2019 would not be met before the expiration date. net2phone recognized a gain of $0.3 million
in the three months ended January 31, 2022 on the write-off of this contingent consideration payment obligation.
29
Traditional
Communications Segment
The
Traditional Communications segment, which represented 81.5% and 88.5% of our total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively, and 82.0% and 89.3% of our total revenues in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, includes
Mobile Top-Up, which enables customers to transfer airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging, and data to international and domestic
mobile accounts, BOSS Revolution Calling, an international long-distance calling service marketed primarily to immigrant communities
in the United States and Canada, and IDT Global, a wholesale provider of international voice and SMS termination and outsourced traffic
management solutions to telecoms worldwide. Traditional Communications also includes other small businesses and offerings including early-stage
business initiatives and mature businesses in harvest mode.
Traditional
Communications’ most significant revenue streams are from Mobile Top-Up, BOSS Revolution Calling, and IDT Global. Mobile Top-Up
and BOSS Revolution Calling are sold direct-to-consumers and through distributors and retailers. We receive payments for BOSS Revolution
Calling, traditional calling cards, and Mobile Top-Up prior to providing the services. We recognize the revenue when services are provided
to the customer. Traditional Communications’ revenues tend to be somewhat seasonal, with the second fiscal quarter (which contains
Christmas and New Year’s Day) and the fourth fiscal quarter (which contains Mother’s Day and Father’s Day) typically
showing higher minute volumes.

Revenues.
Revenues
from Mobile Top-Up decreased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022
primarily from the deterioration of a key corridor that was particularly impactful to revenues in the business-to-business wholesale
and retail channels, partially offset by an increase in direct-to-consumer channel revenue.
Revenues
and minutes of use from BOSS Revolution Calling decreased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar
periods in fiscal 2022. BOSS Revolution Calling continues to be impacted by persistent, market-wide trends, including the proliferation
of unlimited calling plans offered by wireless carriers and mobile virtual network operators, and the increasing penetration of free
and paid over-the-top voice, video conferencing, and messaging services.
Revenues
and minutes of use from IDT Global decreased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal
2022 as communications globally continued to transition away from international voice calling. This trend was accelerated by the impact
of COVID-19 as business communications shifted from calling to video conferencing and other collaboration platforms. We expect that IDT
Global will continue to be adversely impacted by these trends, and minutes of use and revenues will likely continue to decline from quarter-to-quarter,
as we seek to maximize economics rather than necessarily sustain minutes of use or revenues.
Direct
Cost of Revenues . Direct cost of revenues decreased in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods
in fiscal 2022 primarily due to decreases in IDT Global, Mobile Top-Up, and BOSS Revolution Calling’s direct cost of revenues in
the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022, mostly due to the decrease in revenues.
Selling,
General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative expense decreased in the three and six months ended January 31,
2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022 primarily due to decreases in debit and credit card processing charges, employee
compensation, and sales commissions, partially offset by increases in marketing expense and stock-based compensation expense. As a
percentage of Traditional Communications’ revenue, Traditional Communications’ selling, general and administrative
expense increased to 10.7% from 9.6% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and increased to 10.5% from
9.0% in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
30
Depreciation
and Amortization.
Depreciation and amortization expense was substantially unchanged in the three months ended January 31, 2023
compared to the similar period in fiscal 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in the six months ended January 31,
2023 compared to the similar period in fiscal 2022 primarily due to decreases in depreciation as more of our property, plant, and
equipment became fully depreciated, partially offset by increases in depreciation of equipment added to our telecommunications
network and capitalized costs of consultants and employees developing internal use software.

Corporate
costs mainly include compensation, consulting fees, treasury, tax and accounting services, human resources, corporate purchasing, corporate
governance including Board of Directors’ fees, internal and external audit, investor relations, corporate insurance, corporate
legal, and other corporate-related general and administrative expenses. Corporate does not generate any revenues, nor does it incur any
direct cost of revenues.
General and Administrative.  Corporate
general and administrative expense increased in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar period in fiscal 2022
primarily because of increases in employee compensation, stock-based compensation expense, and consulting fees. Corporate general and
administrative expense increased in the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar period in fiscal 2022 primarily because
of an increase in consulting fees. As a percentage of our consolidated revenues, Corporate general and administrative expense was 0.8%
and 0.7% in the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 0.7% and 0.6% in the six months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively.
Other Operating Expense, net .   As
discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this Quarterly Report, we (as well as other
defendants) have been named in a pending class action on behalf of the stockholders of our former subsidiary, Straight Path Communications
Inc., or Straight Path. We incurred legal fees of $1.6 million and $2.7 million in the three months ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $4.1 million and $3.7 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively
related to this action. Also, we recorded offsetting gains from insurance claims for this matter of $1.3 million and $2.0 million in the
three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $3.0 million and $2.9 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively.
Consolidated
The
following is a discussion of certain of our consolidated expenses, and our consolidated income and expense line items below income from
operations.
Related
Party Lease Costs.
We lease office and parking space in a building and parking garage located at 520 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey
that was previously owned by our former subsidiary, Rafael Holdings, Inc., or Rafael. On August 22, 2022, Rafael sold the building and
parking garage to an unrelated third party. Our lease in that building continues with the new owner. We lease office space in Israel
from Rafael. The Newark lease expires in April 2025 and the Israel lease expires in July 2025. In the three and six months ended January
31, 2023, we incurred lease costs of $32,000 and $0.2 million, respectively, in connection with the Rafael leases, which excludes Newark
lease costs after August 22, 2022. In the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, we incurred lease costs of $0.5 million and $0.9
million, respectively, in connection with the Rafael leases. Lease costs incurred in connection with the Rafael leases is included in
consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses.
Stock-Based
Compensation Expense.  Stock-based compensation expense included in consolidated selling, general and administrative
expenses was $1.3 million and $0.3 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $1.9 million and
$0.6 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increases were primarily due to the grant of
deferred stock units, or DSUs, that, upon vesting, will entitle the grantees to receive shares of our Class B common stock. On
December 5, 2022, we granted 187,975 DSUs to certain of our executive officers and other employees. Subject to continued full time
employment or other service to us, the DSUs are scheduled to vest in three equal amounts on each of May 17, 2023, February 21, 2024,
and February 25, 2025. The number of shares that will be issuable on each vesting date will vary between 50% to 200% of the number
of DSUs that vest on that vesting date, depending on the market price for the underlying Class B common stock on the vesting date
relative to the price approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors of $25.45 per share (which was based on the
market price at the time of the grant). In addition, the grantee will have the right to elect a later vesting date no later than
April 14, 2023 for the May 17, 2023 vesting date, and no later than January 19, 2024 for the February 21, 2024 vesting date. A
grantee will have the option to elect a later vesting date for one-half or all of the shares scheduled to vest on the then upcoming
vesting date and any DSUs that do not vest based on the grantee’s election, will be eligible to vest on the subsequent
scheduled vesting date. We estimated that the fair value of the DSUs on the date of grant was $5.1 million, which is being recognized
on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods ending in February 2025. We used a risk neutral Monte Carlo simulation
method in our valuation of the DSUs, which simulated the range of possible future values of our Class B common stock over the life
of the DSUs. The weighted average grant date fair value per DSU was $27.20. At January 31, 2023, there was $4.2 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested DSUs.
Effective as of June 30, 2022, restricted
shares of NRS’ Class B common stock were granted to certain NRS employees. The restrictions on the shares will lapse in three installments
on each of June 1, 2024, 2026, and 2027. The estimated fair value of the restricted shares on the grant date was $3.3 million, which will
be recognized over the vesting period. At January 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation cost related to NRS’ non-vested Class B common
stock was an aggregate of $2.9 million. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting periods
that end in fiscal 2027.

We
have an investment in series B and series C convertible preferred stock of a communications company (the equity method investee, or EMI),
that represents 26.57% of the outstanding shares of the EMI on an as converted basis. We account for this investment using the equity
method since the series B and series C convertible preferred stock are in-substance common stock, and we can exercise significant influence
over the operating and financial policies of the EMI.
The losses on investments, net in the three
months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 included unrealized gains (losses) of $0.1 million and $(1.0) million, respectively, on shares
of Rafael’s Class B common stock. The losses on investments, net in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 included unrealized
gains (losses) of $9,000 and $(13.5) million, respectively, on shares of Rafael’s Class B common stock.
Provision for Income Taxes.
The increase
in income tax expense in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the similar periods in fiscal 2022 was primarily
due to differences in the amount of taxable income earned in the various taxing jurisdictions.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling
Interests . The change in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared
to the similar period in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a decline in the net income of certain subsidiaries, partially offset by increases
in the net income of NRS as well as a reductions in the net loss of net2phone 2.0, Inc., which owns and operates our net2phone segment.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, including the impact of COVID-19, we expect our cash from operations and the balance of cash, cash
equivalents, debt securities, and current equity investments that we held on January 31, 2023 will be sufficient to meet our currently
anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the twelve-month period ending January 31, 2024.
At
January 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents, debt securities, and current equity investments of $156.8 million and working capital
(current assets in excess of current liabilities) of $85.6 million.
32
We
treat unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held by IDT Payment Services, Inc. and IDT Payment Services of New York, LLC as substantially
restricted and unavailable for other purposes. At January 31, 2023, “Cash and cash equivalents” in our consolidated balance
sheet included an aggregate of $31.2 million held by IDT Payment Services, Inc. and IDT Payment Services of New York, LLC that was unavailable
for other purposes.

Operating
Activities
Our
cash flow from operations varies significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, depending on our operating results and
the timing of operating cash receipts and payments, specifically trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable.
Gross
trade accounts receivable decreased to $53.9 million at January 31, 2023 from $70.2 million at July 31, 2022 primarily due to amounts
collected in the six months ended January 31, 2023 that were greater than billings during the period.
Deferred
revenue arises from sales of prepaid products and varies from period to period depending on the mix and the timing of revenues. Deferred
revenue decreased to $35.0 million at January 31, 2023 from $36.5 million at July 31, 2022 primarily due to decreases in the BOSS Revolution
Calling and Mobile Top-Up deferred revenue balances.
Customer deposit liabilities at IDT Financial
Services increased to $86.9 million at January 31, 2023 from $85.8 million at July 31, 2022. Our restricted cash and cash equivalents
included $87.7 million and $86.6 million at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, held by IDT Financial Services.
On June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in
South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., holding that a state may require a remote seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and
remit sales tax on goods and services provided to purchasers in the state, overturning certain existing court precedent. It is possible
that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for periods for which we have not collected sales, use or other similar
taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position,
and operating results. One or more jurisdictions may change their laws or policies to apply their sales, use or other similar taxes
to our operations, and if such changes were made it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, and operating
results.

As
discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this Quarterly Report, we (as well as other
defendants) have been named in a pending class action on behalf of the stockholders of our former subsidiary, Straight Path. We are vigorously defending this matter. At this stage, we are unable to estimate our potential liability,
if any. In addition, in connection with our spin-off of Straight Path in July 2013, we and Straight Path entered into various agreements
prior to the spin-off including a Separation and Distribution Agreement to effect the separation and provide a framework for our relationship
with Straight Path after the spin-off, and a Tax Separation Agreement, which sets forth the responsibilities of us and Straight Path
with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local, and foreign taxes for periods before and including the spin-off,
the preparation and filing of tax returns for such periods and disputes with taxing authorities regarding taxes for such periods. Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we indemnify Straight Path and Straight Path indemnifies us for losses related to the failure
of the other to pay, perform or otherwise discharge, any of the liabilities and obligations set forth in the agreement. Pursuant to the
Tax Separation Agreement, we indemnify Straight Path from all liability for taxes of Straight Path or any of its subsidiaries or relating
to the Straight Path business with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the spin-off, from all liability for taxes of ours,
other than Straight Path and its subsidiaries, for any taxable period, and from all liability for taxes due to the spin-off.
Investing
Activities
Our
capital expenditures were $10.6 million and $9.0 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We currently
anticipate that total capital expenditures in the twelve-month period ending January 31, 2024 will be $20 million to $22 million. We
expect to fund our capital expenditures with our net cash provided by operating activities and cash, cash equivalents, debt securities,
and current equity investments on hand.
On
August 10, 2021, we paid $1.1 million to purchase shares of the EMI’s series C convertible preferred stock and additional shares
of the EMI’s series B convertible preferred stock. The purchases increased our ownership of the EMI’s outstanding shares
to 26.57% from 23.95% on an as converted basis.
Purchases
of debt securities and equity investments were $28.1 million and $10.8 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Proceeds from maturities and sales of debt securities and redemptions of equity investments were $27.5 million and $6.1 million in the
six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Financing
Activities
We
distributed cash of $0.2 million and $0.2 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to the noncontrolling
interests in certain of our subsidiaries.
In
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we received proceeds from financing-related other liabilities of $0.3 million and $2.3
million, respectively.
In
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we repaid financing-related other liabilities of $2.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
Our subsidiary, IDT Telecom, Inc., or IDT
Telecom, entered into a credit agreement, dated as of May 17, 2021, with TD Bank, N.A. for a revolving credit facility for up to a maximum
principal amount of $25.0 million. IDT Telecom may use the proceeds to finance working capital requirements and for certain closing costs
of the facility. At January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. In the six months ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022, IDT Telecom borrowed and repaid an aggregate of $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, under the facility.
The revolving credit facility is secured by primarily all of IDT Telecom’s assets. The principal outstanding bears interest per
annum at the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration Ltd. LIBOR multiplied by the Regulation D maximum reserve requirement
plus 125 to 175 basis points, depending upon IDT Telecom’s leverage ratio as computed for the most recent fiscal quarter. Interest
is payable monthly, and all outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due on May 16, 2024. IDT Telecom pays a quarterly
unused commitment fee on the average daily balance of the unused portion of the $25.0 million commitment of 30 to 85 basis points, depending
upon IDT Telecom’s leverage ratio as computed for the most recent fiscal quarter. IDT Telecom is required to comply with various
affirmative and negative covenants as well as maintain certain targets based on financial ratios during the term of the revolving credit
facility. As of January 31, 2023, IDT Telecom was in compliance with all of the covenants.
On
September 29, 2021, NRS sold shares of its Class B common stock representing 2.5% of its outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted
basis to Alta Fox Opportunities Fund LP, or Alta Fox, for cash of $10 million. Alta Fox has the right to request that NRS redeem all
or any portion of the NRS common shares that it purchased at the per share purchase price during a period of 182 days following the fifth
anniversary of this transaction. The redemption right shall terminate upon the consummation of (i) a sale of NRS or its assets for cash
or securities that are listed on a national securities exchange, (ii) a public offering of NRS’ securities, or (iii) a distribution
of NRS’ capital stock following which NRS’ common shares are listed on a national securities exchange.
34
In the six months ended January 31, 2023,
we received cash from the exercise of stock options of $0.2 million, for which we issued 12,500 shares of our Class B common stock. There
were no stock option exercises in the six months ended January 31, 2022.
We
have an existing stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors for the repurchase of shares of our Class B common stock.
The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 8.0 million shares in the aggregate. In the six months ended January 31, 2023,
we repurchased 203,436 shares of Class B common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million. There were no repurchases under
the program in the six months ended January 31, 2022. At January 31, 2023, 5.0 million shares remained available for repurchase under
the stock repurchase program.
In
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we paid $0.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively, to repurchase 13,403 and
200,438 shares, respectively, of our Class B common stock that were tendered by employees of ours to satisfy the employees’
tax withholding obligations in connection with shares issued for bonus payments, the vesting of DSUs, and lapsing of restrictions on
restricted stock. Such shares were repurchased by us based on their fair market value as of the close of business on the trading day
immediately prior to the vesting date.
Other
Sources and Uses of Resources
We
are considering spin-offs and other potential dispositions of certain of our subsidiaries. Some of the transactions under consideration
are in early stages and others are more advanced. A spin-off may include the contribution of a significant amount of cash, cash equivalents,
debt securities, and/or equity securities to the subsidiary prior to the spin-off, which would reduce our capital resources. There is
no assurance at this time that any of these transactions will be completed.
We
intend to, where appropriate, make strategic investments and acquisitions to complement, expand, and/or enter into new businesses. In
considering acquisitions and investments, we search for opportunities to profitably grow our existing businesses and/or to add qualitatively
to the range and diversification of businesses in our portfolio. At this time, we cannot guarantee that we will be presented with acquisition
opportunities that meet our return-on-investment criteria, or that our efforts to make acquisitions that meet our criteria will be successful.
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
Foreign
Currency Risk
Revenues from our international operations
were 28% of our consolidated revenues in each of the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. Therefore, a significant portion
of our revenues is in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our foreign currency exchange risk is somewhat mitigated by our ability to
offset a portion of these non-U.S. Dollar-denominated revenues with operating expenses that are paid in the same currencies. While the
impact from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affects our revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, the net amount
of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes at the end of each reporting period is generally not material.
Investment
Risk
We
hold a portion of our assets in debt and equity securities, including hedge funds, for strategic and speculative purposes. At
January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the value of our debt and equity security holdings was an aggregate of $45.7 million and $46.8
million, respectively, which represented 9% of our total assets at both dates. Investments in debt and equity securities carry a degree of risk
and depend to a great extent on correct assessments of the future course of price movements of securities and other instruments.
There can be no assurance that our investment managers will be able to accurately predict these price movements. The securities
markets have in recent years been characterized by great volatility and unpredictability. Accordingly, the value of our investments
may go down as well as up and we may not receive the amounts originally invested upon redemption.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended),
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
