NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   1. THE COMPANY AND OPERATIONS   Solitron Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Solitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), designs, develops, manufactures, and markets solid-state semiconductor components and related devices primarily for the military and aerospace markets. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1959 and reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1987.   2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation The unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.   The unaudited financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending February 28, 2023.   The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2022.   Use of estimates The financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable. The Company could have reasonably used different accounting estimates. This applies in particular to inventory and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company’s future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. The ultimate impact from COVID-19 on the Company’s operations and financial results during fiscal 2023 will depend on, among other things, the ultimate severity and scope of the pandemic, the pace at which governmental and private travel restrictions and public concerns about public gatherings will ease, and the speed with which the economy recovers. The Company is not able to fully quantify the impact that these factors will have on the Company’s financial results during fiscal 2023 and beyond. The Company believes COVID-19 had a negative impact on the Company’s bookings in fiscal 2022, which will negatively impact fiscal 2023 net sales.   Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and money market accounts.   Short-term Investments Short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. Treasury securities are classified as held to maturity, mature in less than
twelve
months, and are reported at amortized cost which approximates fair value of $ 2,512,000
as of November 30, 2022.   Investment in Marketable Securities Investment in Marketable Securities includes investments in common stocks and bonds. Investments in securities are reported at fair value with changes in unrecognized gains or losses included in other income on the statements of operations.   7 Table of Contents   The following table summarizes investments in marketable securities at:   November 30, 2022         Gross     Gross         Marketable Securities:   Cost     Unrealized Gains     Unrealized Losses     Fair Value   Common Stocks   $ 1,045,000     $ 399,000     $ ( 57,000 )   $ 1,387,000     February 28, 2022         Gross     Gross         Marketable Securities:   Cost     Unrealized Gains     Unrealized Losses     Fair Value   Common Stocks   $ 668,000     $ 42,000     $ ( 26,000 )   $ 684,000     At November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, the deferred tax liability related to unrecognized gains and losses on marketable securities was $0.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, defines “fair value” as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  ASC Topic 820 also sets forth a valuation hierarchy of the inputs (assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability) used to measure fair value.  This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into the following three levels:   Level 1:  Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets. Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3:  Inputs that are generally unobservable.  These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.   November 30, 2022   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total   Common Stocks   $ 1,387,000     $ -     $ -     $ 1,387,000   Limited Partnerships

Finished goods:   All finished goods with firm orders for later delivery are valued (material and overhead) at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  All finished goods with no orders are fully reserved.       Direct labor costs:    Direct labor costs are allocated to finished goods and work in process inventory based on engineering estimates of the number of man-hours required from the different direct labor departments to bring each device to its particular level of completion. Manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to finished goods and work in process inventory as a ratio to direct labor costs.   Property, Plant, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend their expected life are expensed as incurred.  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the lives of the related assets:

Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist principally of cash and account receivables.  The Company places its cash with high credit quality institutions.  At times, such amounts may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits.  The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on the accounts.  As of November 30, 2022, all non-interest bearing checking accounts were FDIC insured to a limit of $ 250,000 . Deposits in excess of FDIC insured limits were approximately $ 322,000
at November 30, 2022, as compared to $ 3,448,000
at February 28, 2022.  With respect to the account receivables, most of the Company’s products are custom made pursuant to contracts with customers whose end-products are sold to the United States Government.  The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains allowances for potential credit losses.  Actual losses and allowances have historically been within management’s expectations.   9 Table of Contents   Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share Net income (loss) per common share is presented in accordance with ASC Topic 260-10 “Earnings per Share.”  Basic earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per common share incorporate the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options to the extent they are not anti-dilutive using the treasury stock method.  The Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding during fiscal 2022 and 2023; therefore, there is no effect from dilution on earnings per share.   Revenue Recognition The Company records revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,”
which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers.   The core principle of the guidance in ASC Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.   To achieve that core principle, the Company applied the following steps:   1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.   The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets solid-state semiconductor components and related devices.  The Company’s products are used as components primarily in the military and aerospace markets.
The Company’s revenues are from purchase orders and/or contracts with customers associated with manufacture of products.  We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.   2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.   The majority of the Company’s purchase orders or contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the shipment of products.   3. Determine the transaction price.   The transaction price reflects the Company’s expectations about the consideration it will be entitled to receive from the customer at a fixed price per unit shipped based on the terms of the contract or purchase order with the customer. To the extent our actual costs vary from the fixed price that was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss.   4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.   5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.   This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. The Company receives purchase orders for products to be delivered over multiple dates that may extend across reporting periods. The Company’s accounting policy treats shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost. The Company invoices for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues at the fixed price for each distinct product delivered when transfer of control has occurred, which is generally upon shipment.   In addition, the Company may have a contract or purchase order to provide a non-recurring engineering service to a customer. These contracts are reviewed, performance obligations are determined, and we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.   We recognize revenue on sales to distributors when the distributor takes control of the products (“sold-to” model).  We have agreements with distributors that allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products, which we refer to as a “scrap allowance.” Consistent with industry practice, we also have a “stock, ship and debit” program whereby we consider requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors’ inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.  We have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by us after product is sold by us to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.  In addition, we have a termination clause in one of our distributor agreements that would allow for a full credit for all inventory upon 60 days’ notice of terminating the agreement.
10 Table of Contents   We recognize the estimated variable consideration to be received as revenue and record a related accrued expense for the consideration not expected to be received, based upon an estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, “stock, ship and debit” credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.  We make these estimates based upon sales levels to our customers during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.  Our estimates require the exercise of significant judgments.  We believe that we have a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.   Related Party Transactions The Company currently purchases and has purchased in the past die and wafers, as specified by the Company’s customers, from ES Components.  Dwight Aubrey, a director of the Company, is a minority owner and an immediate family member of the majority owner of ES Components.    For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, the Company purchased $ 109,892
of die and $ 0
of used equipment from ES Components.  For the nine months ended November 30, 2021, the Company purchased $ 94,215
of die and $ 0
of used equipment from ES Components. The Company has included the expenses related to die in cost of goods sold in the accompanying statements of operations. The Company occasionally makes sales to ES Components.  For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, sales were $ 0 .
Stock based compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation,” which establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services.  Under ASC Topic 718, the Company recognizes an expense for the fair value of outstanding stock options and grants as they vest, whether held by employees or others.  No vesting of stock options or grants occurred during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022 or November 30, 2021.   Financial Statement Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates and the differences could be material.  Such estimates include variable consideration related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, depreciable life of property and equipment, accounts receivable allowance, deferred tax valuation allowance, and allowance for inventory obsolescence.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company does not believe that any recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.   3.
REVENUE RECOGNITION   As of November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, sales returns and allowances accrual activity is shown below:       November 30, 2022     November 30, 2021   Beginning Balance   $ 471,000     $ 354,000   Accrued Allowances     -       117,000   Credits Issued     -       -   Ending Balance   $ 471,000     $ 471,000     As noted in Note 2 above, one of our distributor agreements has a termination clause that would allow for a full credit for all inventory upon 60 days’ notice of terminating the agreement.  As of November 30, 2022, and February 28, 2022, the inventory balance at that distributor was believed to be $ 1,905,000
and $ 2,178,000 , respectively.  Based upon sales levels to and by the distributor during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs, we believe it is highly unlikely that the distributor would exercise termination.  Should termination occur, we believe the products could be sold to other distributors or held in inventory for future sale.
The Company warrants that its products, when delivered, will be free from defects in material workmanship under normal use and service.  The obligations are limited to replacing, repairing, or reimbursing for, at the option of the Company, any products that are returned within one year after the date of shipment. The Company does not reserve for potential warranty costs based on historical experience and the nature of its cost tracking system.

NOTES PAYABLE   On July 21, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds of $ 807,415
under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”). The Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The PPP Loan to the Company was made through Bank of America, N.A., a national banking association. The PPP Loan was scheduled to mature on
July 21, 2025
and bore interest at a rate of
1 % per annum. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan were initially deferred until January 1, 2021 and based on applying for forgiveness the deferral was extended through October 31, 2021. The PPP Loan could have been prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Funds from the PPP Loan may only be used for payroll costs, costs to continue group health care benefits, mortgage payments, rent, utilities, and interest payments on certain other debt obligations. The Company used the entire PPP Loan amount for qualifying expenses. Under the terms of the PPP, certain amounts of the PPP Loan may be forgiven if they are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act. On June 12, 2021 the SBA notified Bank of America that the Company’s application for complete forgiveness of its PPP loan was approved.   On April 16, 2021, the Company closed on the acquisition of a facility and real estate located in West Palm Beach, Florida for a purchase price of $ 4,200,000
pursuant to the Commercial Contract entered into on March 1, 2021.
In connection with the acquisition, the Company obtained mortgage financing from Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank”) in the amount of $2,940,000 (the “Loan”) to fund that portion of the total purchase price, and entered into the Master Credit Agreement, a Note, a Mortgage, Assignment of Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing and Financial Covenant Agreement
(the “FCA”). The Loan accrues interest at a fixed rate of
3.8 % per year and matures on
April 15, 2031 . Beginning on May 15, 2021 the Company began making monthly installment payments of $ 17,593
consisting of principal and interest. The payment and performance of the Loan is secured by a security interest in the property acquired. The Master Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, undertakings and events of default customary for these types of agreements. Additionally,
under the terms of the FCA, the Company has agreed to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.15:1.0, calculated at the end of each fiscal year, using the results of the twelve-month period ending with that reporting period, and has agreed to maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum of no less than $1,000,000 of unrestricted, unencumbered liquid assets.   14 Table of Contents   On June 29, 2022, the Company received notification from the Bank that the Bank had elected to suspend certain financial and reporting requirements set forth in the FCA.

In addition, the Bank elected to suspend the requirements in the FCA, if any, for the submission of financial statements and information by the Borrower on a periodic basis as specified in Section 2.4, ‘Financial Information’ of the FCA.

Net Sales.
Net sales for the three months ended November 30, 2022 decreased 76% to $584,000 as compared to $2,468,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2021.  The decrease in net sales was largely due to the company relocating to its new facility during the three months ended November 30, 2022 along with associated startup delays.
Net bookings for the three months ended November 30, 2022 increased 68% to $2,257,000 versus $1,340,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2021.   Backlog as of November 30, 2022 increased 101% to $6,430,000 as compared to a backlog of $3,197,000 as of November 30, 2021.
Cost of Sales.
Cost of sales for the three months ended November 30, 2022 decreased to $905,000 from $1,672,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2021, due to decreased raw materials and labor costs associated with decreased net sales, and decreased rent expense.  Expressed as a percentage of net sales, cost of sales increased to 155% for the three months ended November 30, 2022 from 68% for the three months ended November 30, 2021.     Gross Profit (Loss).   Gross profit (loss) for the three months ended November 30, 2022 decreased to ($321,000) from $796,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2021, due primarily to lower net sales not covering fixed labor and overhead costs.  Accordingly, gross margins expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased to (55%) for the three months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to 32% for the three months ended November 30, 2021.
For the three months ended November 30, 2022, we shipped 6,130 units as compared to 36,047 units shipped during the same period of the prior year.  It should be noted that since we manufacture a wide variety of products with an average sales price ranging from a few dollars to several hundred dollars, such periodic variations in our volume of units shipped should not be regarded as a reliable indicator of our performance.   Selling, General & Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to $460,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2022 from $497,000 for the same period in the prior year.  The decrease was due to a decrease in selling expenses of $34,000.  During the three months ended November 30, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 79% as compared to 20% for the three months ended November 30, 2021.

Net Sales.
Net sales for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 decreased 52% to $4,907,000 as compared to $10,308,000 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021.  The decrease in net sales was largely due to the decision to accelerate production and shipments in the nine months ended November 30, 2021 due to the planned facility relocation.
Net bookings for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 increased 46% to $6,871,000 versus $4,713,000 during the nine months ended November 30, 2021.  Backlog as of November 30, 2022 increased 101% to $6,430,000 as compared to a backlog of $3,197,000 as of November 30, 2021.
Cost of Sales.
Cost of sales for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 decreased to $3,710,000 from $5,628,000 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021, due to decreased raw materials and labor costs associated with decreased net sales, and decreased rent expense.  Expressed as a percentage of net sales, cost of sales increased to 76% for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 from 55% for the nine months ended November 30, 2021.     17 Table of Contents   Gross Profit.   Gross profit for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 decreased to $1,197,000 from $4,680,000 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021, due primarily to lower net sales.  Accordingly, gross margins expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased to 24% for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to 45% for the nine months ended November 30, 2021.
For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we shipped 39,012 units as compared to 89,512 units shipped during the same period of the prior year.  It should be noted that since we manufacture a wide variety of products with an average sales price ranging from a few dollars to several hundred dollars, such periodic variations in our volume of units shipped should not be regarded as a reliable indicator of our performance.   Selling, General & Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to $1,535,000 for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 from $1,870,000 for the same period in the prior year.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bonus accrual of $200,000 and a decrease in selling expenses of $106,000.  During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 31% as compared to 18% for the nine months ended November 30, 2021.

Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements”.  These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters.  Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results.  Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.  Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements.  These factors include those described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2022, including those identified below. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.   Some of the factors that may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects include:     · Loss of, or reduction of business from, substantial clients could hurt our business by reducing our revenues, profitability and cash flow.   · Our complex manufacturing processes may lower yields and reduce our revenues.   · Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain qualified supplies of raw materials, parts and finished components on a timely basis and at a cost-effective price.   · Our inventories may become obsolete and other assets may be subject to risks.   · Environmental regulations could require us to incur significant costs.   · Our business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce gross profit margins and the value of an investment in our Company.   · Our operating results may decrease due to the decline of profitability in the semiconductor industry.   · We may not achieve the intended effects of our business strategy, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
19 Table of Contents     · Our inability to introduce new products could result in decreased revenues and loss of market share to competitors; new technologies could also reduce the demand for our products.   · The nature of our products exposes us to potentially significant product liability risk.   · We depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business.   · Failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to use certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete.   · We cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment.   · We may make substantial investments in plant and equipment that may become impaired.   · While we attempt to monitor the credit worthiness of our customers, we may be at risk due to the adverse financial condition of one or more customers.   · Our international operations expose us to material risks, including risks under U.S. export laws.   · Compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.   · We are dependent on government contracts, which are subject to termination, price renegotiations and regulatory compliance, which can increase the cost of doing business and negatively impact our revenues.   · Changes in government policy or economic conditions could negatively impact our results.   · Changes in Defense related programs and priorities could reduce the revenues and profitability of our business.   · The COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.   · Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the integrity of our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.   · Our failure to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or our identification of any other material weaknesses in the future may adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting.   · Provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult to acquire our Company and may reduce the market price of our stock.   · The price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely in the future.   · We cannot guarantee that we will declare future cash dividend payments, nor repurchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.   · Uncertainty of current economic conditions, domestically and globally, could continue to affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business.   · Natural disasters, like hurricanes, or occurrences of other natural disasters whether in the United States or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability.
