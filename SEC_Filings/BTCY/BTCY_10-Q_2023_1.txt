NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Biotricity
Inc. (formerly MetaSolutions, Inc.) (the “Company” or “Biotricity”) was incorporated under the laws of the State
of Nevada on August 29, 2012. iMedical Innovations Inc. (“iMedical”) was incorporated on July 3, 2014 under the laws of the
Province of Ontario, Canada and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biotricity through reverse take-over on February 2, 2016.
Both
the Company and iMedical are engaged in research and development activities within the remote monitoring segment of preventative care.
They are focused on a realizable healthcare business model that has an existing market and commercialization pathway. As such, its efforts
to date have been devoted to building and commercializing an ecosystem of technologies that enable access to this market.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, MEASUREMENT AND CONSOLIDATION
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) for interim financial information and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction
with Biotricity’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 and their accompanying
notes.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (“USD”). In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial
position and results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. Operating results for the interim periods
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2023. The Company’s
fiscal year-end is March 31.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. Significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Certain
prior year amounts related to general and administrative expenses and other (expense) income line items on the condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.
Liquidity
and Basis of Presentation
The
Company is in the early stages of commercializing its first product and is concurrently in development mode, operating a research and
development program in order to develop, obtain regulatory clearance for, and commercialize other proposed products. The Company has
incurred recurring losses from operations, and as at December 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $ 107,713,387
and a working capital deficiency of $ 2,496,289 .
Management anticipates the Company will continue on its revenue growth trajectory and improve its liquidity through continued business
development and after additional equity or debt capitalization of the Company. On August 30, 2021, the Company completed an underwritten
public offering of its common stock that concurrently facilitated its listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Prior to listing on the Nasdaq
Capital Market, the Company had also filed a shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-255544) with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on April 27, 2021, which was declared effective on May 4, 2021. This may help facilitate better transactional preparedness
when the Company seeks to issue equity or debt to potential investors, since it continues to allow the Company to offer its shares to
investors only by means of a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, which forms part of an effective registration statement.
As such, the Company has developed and continues to pursue sources of funding that management believes will be sufficient to support
the Company’s operating plan and alleviate any substantial doubt as to its ability to meet its obligations at least for a period
of one year from the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company
raised $ 499,900
through government EIDL loan. In addition, during
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021, the Company raised total net proceeds of $ 14,545,805
through the underwritten public offering that
was concurrent with its listing onto the Nasdaq Capital Markets. Furthermore, during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021, the
Company raised an additional net proceeds of $ 11,756,563
through a term loan transaction (Note 6). During
the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company raised short-term loans and promissory notes with net proceeds of $ 1,889,144
from various lenders.

As
we proceed with the commercialization of the Bioflux, Biotres, and Biocare product development, we expect to continue to devote significant
resources on capital expenditures, as well as research and development costs and operations, marketing and sales expenditures.
Based
on the above facts and assumptions, we believe our existing cash, along with anticipated near-term equity financings, will be sufficient
to meet our needs for the next twelve months from the filing date of this report. However, we will need to seek additional debt or equity
capital to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protecting our intellectual property,
developing or acquiring new lines of business and enhancing our operating infrastructure. The terms of our future financings may be dilutive
to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators
or other third parties. There can be no assurance we will be able to raise this additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If
we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to modify our operating plan and otherwise curtail or
slow the pace of development and commercialization of our proposed product lines.
In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread globally, causing significant
disruption to the global and US economy. On March 20, 2020, the Company announced the precautionary measures taken as well as announcing
the business impact related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Though its operations have since returned to a normal state, the
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect the economy and the Company’s operations remains unclear and will
depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of any future
ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative
and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption,
reduced patient traffic and reduced operations. The measures taken to date may continue to impact the Company’s fiscal year 2023
business and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its geographies, may be impacted
to some degree, but the significance of the full long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s business and the duration
for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”)
on April 1, 2018. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by applying
the core principles – 1) identify the contract with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine
the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue as performance
obligations are satisfied.

Both
the Bioflux mobile cardiac telemetry device, and the Biotres device are wearable devices. The cardiac data that the devices monitor and
collect is curated and analyzed by the Company’s proprietary algorithms and then securely communicated to a remote monitoring facility
for electronic reporting and conveyance to the patient’s prescribing physician or other certified cardiac medical professional.
Revenues earned are comprised of device sales revenues and technology fee revenues (technology as a service). The devices, together with
their licensed software, are available for sale to the medical center or physician, who is responsible for the delivery of clinical diagnosis
and therapy. The remote monitoring, data collection and reporting services performed by the technology culminate in a patient study that
is generally billable when it is complete and is issued to the physician. In order to recognize revenue, management considers whether
or not the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a commercial arrangement exists, and delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered. For sales of devices, which are invoiced directly, additional revenue recognition criteria include that the price
is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured; for device sales contracts with terms of more than one year, the
Company recognizes any significant financing component as revenue over the contractual period using the effective interest method, and
the associated interest income is reflected accordingly on the statement of operations and included in other income; for revenue that
is earned based on customer usage of the proprietary software to render a patient’s cardiac study, the Company recognizes revenue
when the study ends based on a fixed billing rate. Costs associated with providing the services are recorded as the service is provided
regardless of whether or when revenue is recognized.
The
Company may also earn service-related revenue from contracts with other counterparties with which it consults. This contract work is
separate and distinct from services provided to clinical customers, but may be with a reseller or other counterparties that are working
to establish their operations in foreign jurisdictions or ancillary products or market segments in which the Company has expertise and
may eventually conduct business.
The
Company recognized the following forms of revenue for the three

Inventory
Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost and market value, cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis. Market value of our inventory,
which is all purchased finished goods, is determined based on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price
less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation. The Company records write-downs of inventory that is obsolete or in excess
of anticipated demand or market value based on consideration of product lifecycle stage, technology trends, product development plans
and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may
have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Inventory write-downs are charged to cost of revenue and establish a new cost basis
for the inventory.
Significant
accounting estimates and assumptions
The
preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions to be made in applying the
accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. The estimates and related assumptions are based on previous experiences and other factors considered reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.

(Expressed

The
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods.
Significant
accounts that require estimates as the basis for determining the stated amounts include share-based compensation, impairment analysis
and fair value of warrants, structured notes, convertible debt and conversion liabilities.
●
Fair
value of stock options
The
Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of equity instruments at the date
at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share-based payments requires determining the most appropriate valuation model for
a grant of such instruments, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. The estimate also requires determining the
most appropriate inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model, including the expected life of the instrument, risk-free rate, volatility,
and dividend yield.
●
Fair
value of warrants
In
determining the fair value of the warrant issued for services and issue pursuant to financing transactions, the Company used the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility rate, risk-free rate, and the remaining expected life of the warrants
that are classified under equity.
●
Fair
value of derivative liabilities
In
determining the fair values of the derivative liabilities from the conversion and redemption features, the Company used valuation models
with the following assumptions: dividend yields, volatility, risk-free rate and the remaining expected life. Changes in those assumptions
and inputs could in turn impact the fair value of the derivative liabilities and can have a material impact on the reported loss and
comprehensive loss for the applicable reporting period.
●
Functional
currency
Determining
the appropriate functional currencies for entities in the Company requires analysis of various factors, including the currencies and
country-specific factors that mainly influence labor, materials, and other operating expenses.
●
Useful
life of property and equipment
The
Company employs significant estimates to determine the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, considering industry trends
such as technological advancements, past experience, expected use and review of asset useful lives. The Company makes estimates when
determining depreciation methods, depreciation rates and asset useful lives, which requires considering industry trends and company-specific
factors. The Company reviews depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values annually or when circumstances change and adjusts
its depreciation methods and assumptions prospectively.
●
Provisions
Provisions
are recognized when the Company has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a previous event, if it is probable that
the Company will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. The amount recognized is
the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account
the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to
reflect the current best estimate of the expected future cash flows.

●
Contingencies
Contingencies
can be either possible assets or possible liabilities arising from past events, which, by their nature, will be resolved only when one
or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential impact of contingencies inherently
involves the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.
●
Inventory
obsolescence
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost and market value. Market value of our inventory, which is all purchased finished goods, is determined
based on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation.
The Company estimates net realizable value as the amount at which inventories are expected to be sold, taking into consideration fluctuations
in retail prices less estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories are written down to net realizable value when the cost
of inventories is estimated to be unrecoverable due to obsolescence, damage, or declining selling prices.
●
Income
and other taxes
The
calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise judgment regarding
the carrying values of assets and liabilities which are subject to accounting estimates inherent in those balances, the interpretation
of income tax legislation across various jurisdictions, expectations about future operating results, the timing of reversal of temporary
differences and possible audits of income tax filings by the tax authorities. In addition, when the Company incurs losses for income
tax purposes, it assesses the probability of taxable income being available in the future based on its budgeted forecasts. These forecasts
are adjusted to take into account certain non-taxable income and expenses and specific rules on the use of unused credits and tax losses.
When
the forecasts indicate that sufficient future taxable income will be available to deduct the temporary differences, a deferred tax asset
is recognized for all deductible temporary differences. Changes or differences in underlying estimates or assumptions may result in changes
to the current or deferred income tax balances on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, a charge or credit to income tax expense
included as part of net income (loss) and may result in cash payments or receipts. Judgment includes consideration of the Company’s
future cash requirements in its tax jurisdictions. All income, capital and commodity tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments.
Changes in interpretations or judgments may result in a change in the Company’s income, capital, or commodity tax provisions in
the future. The amount of such a change cannot be reasonably estimated.
●
Incremental
borrowing rate for lease
The
determination of the Company’s lease obligation and right-of-use asset depends on certain assumptions, which include the selection
of the discount rate. The discount rate is set by reference to the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Significant assumptions
are required to be made when determining which borrowing rates to apply in this determination. Changes in the assumptions used may have
a significant effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share
The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 260-10 which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic loss per share
of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings or loss per share of common stock is computed similarly to basic earnings or loss per share except the weighted average
shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of any common stock equivalents, if dilutive.
The Company’s warrants, options, convertible promissory notes, convertible preferred stock, shares to be issued and restricted
stock awards while outstanding are considered common stock equivalents for this purpose. Diluted earnings is computed utilizing the treasury
method for the warrants, stock options, shares to be issued and restricted stock awards. Diluted earnings with respect to the convertible
promissory notes and convertible preferred stock utilizing the if-converted method was not applicable during the periods presented as
no conditions required for conversion had occurred. No incremental common stock equivalents were included in calculating diluted loss
per share because such inclusion would be anti-dilutive given the net loss reported for the periods presented.
Cash
Cash
includes cash on hand and balances with banks.
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
functional currency of the Company’s Canadian-based subsidiary is the Canadian dollar and the US-based parent is the U.S. dollar.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using
the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate
on the date of the transaction. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included
in net income (loss) for the year. In translating the financial statements of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries from their functional
currency into the Company’s reporting currency of United States dollars, condensed consolidated balance sheet accounts are translated
using the closing exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange
rate prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation, if any, are included in accumulated other comprehensive
loss in stockholders’ deficiency. The Company has not, to the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements, entered
into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable consists of amounts due to the Company from medical facilities, which receive reimbursement from institutions and third-party
government and commercial payors and their related patients, as a result of the Company’s normal business activities. Accounts
receivable is reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible receivables based on historical experience, assessment of
specific risk, review of outstanding invoices, and various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
and recognizes the provision as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Uncollectible accounts are written off against
the allowance after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted and when it is deemed that a balance is uncollectible.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
ASC
820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements
of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
●
Level 1 – Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2 – Valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 3 – Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring management’s
best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value.
In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective
carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these
instruments or interest rates that are comparable to market rates. These financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, deposits
and other receivables, convertible promissory notes and short term loans, federally-guaranteed loans, term loans and accounts payable
and accrued liabilities. The Company’s cash and derivative liabilities, which are carried at fair values, are classified as a Level
1 and Level 3, respectively. The Company’s bank accounts are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore,
bear minimal credit risk.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of
the assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation
of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follow:

Impairment
for Long-Lived Assets
The
Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. ASC 360 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets, including right-of-use
assets, used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner,
except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal. Based on its review at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company believes
there was no impairment of its long-lived assets.

Leases
The
Company is the lessee in a lease contract when the Company obtains the right to use the asset. Operating leases are included in the line
items right-of-use asset, lease obligation, current, and lease obligation, long-term in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Right-of-use
(“ROU”) asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease obligations represent
the Company’s obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease, both of which are recognized based on the present value
of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception
are not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations. The Company determines the lease term by agreement with lessor. As the Company’s lease does
not provide implicit interest rate, the Company uses the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available
at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. The Company provides for Federal, State and Provincial income taxes payable,
as well as for those deferred because of the timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes
versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recoverable or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the
period of the change. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized.
Research
and Development
Research
and development costs, which relate primarily to product and software development, are charged to operations as incurred. Under certain
research and development arrangements with third parties, the Company may be required to make payments that are contingent on the achievement
of specific developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Before a product receives regulatory approval, milestone payments
made to third parties are expensed when the milestone is achieved .
Milestone payments made to third parties after regulatory approval
is received are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the approved product.
Stock
Based Compensation
The
Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with the provision of ASC 718, which requires that all share-based payments issued
to acquire goods or services, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss based on their fair values, net of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the
time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation expense
related to share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
The
Company accounts for stock based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the
fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable,
using the guidelines in ASC 505-50. The Company issues compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management,
accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services.

Convertible
Notes Payable and Derivative Instruments
The
Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-11 to account for the down round features of warrants issued with private placements effective
as of April 1, 2017. In doing so, warrants with a down round feature previously treated as derivative liabilities in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet and measured at fair value are henceforth treated as equity, with no adjustment for changes in fair value at each reporting
period. Previously, the Company accounted for conversion options embedded in convertible notes in accordance with ASC 815. ASC 815 generally
requires companies to bifurcate conversion options embedded in convertible notes from their host instruments and to account for them
as free-standing derivative financial instruments. ASC 815 provides for an exception to this rule when convertible notes, as host instruments,
are deemed to be conventional, as defined by ASC 815-40. The Company accounts for convertible notes deemed conventional and conversion
options embedded in non-conventional convertible notes which qualify as equity under ASC 815, in accordance with the provisions of ASC
470-20, which provides guidance on accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features. Accordingly, the Company
records, as a discount to convertible notes, the intrinsic value of such conversion options based upon the differences between the fair
value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the
note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt.
Preferred
Shares Extinguishments
The
Company accounted for preferred stock redemptions and conversions in accordance to ASU-260-10-S99. For preferred stock redemptions and
conversion, the difference between the fair value of consideration transferred to the holders of the preferred stock and the carrying
amount of the preferred stock is accounted as deemed dividend distribution and subtracted from net loss.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments.” This pronouncement, along with subsequent ASUs issued to clarify provisions of ASU 2016-13, changes the impairment
model for most financial assets and will require the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized
cost. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance
to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on
the financial asset. In developing the estimate for lifetime expected credit loss, entities must incorporate historical experience, current
conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. On November 19, 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit
Losses (Topic 326), finalized various effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller
reporting companies applying the credit losses (CECL), the revised effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.
In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which simplifies
the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current
guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021.
Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a
retrospective or modified retrospective basis. There is no significant impact from adopting ASU 2019-12 on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
In
April 2021, The FASB issued ASU 2021-04 to codify the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on how an issuer
should account for modifications made to equity-classified written call options (hereafter referred to as a warrant to purchase the issuer’s
common stock). The guidance in the ASU requires the issuer to treat a modification of an equity-classified warrant that does not cause
the warrant to become liability-classified as an exchange of the original warrant for a new warrant. This guidance applies whether the
modification is structured as an amendment to the terms and conditions of the warrant or as termination of the original warrant and issuance
of a new warrant. The Company adopted this guidance for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2022. There is no significant impact from
adopting ASU 2021-04 on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Series
A Convertible Promissory Notes :
During
the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company issued $ 11,275,500
(face value) in two series of convertible promissory
notes (the “Series A Notes”) sold under subscription agreements to accredited investors. The Notes mature one year from the
final closing date of the offering and accrue interest at
12 %
per annum.
For
first series of Series A Notes, commencing six months following the Issuance Date, and at any time thereafter (provided the Holder has
not received notice of the Company’s intent to prepay the note), at the sole election of the Holder, any amount of the outstanding
principal and accrued interest of this note (the “Outstanding Balance”) could be converted into that number of shares of
Common Stock equal to: (i) the Outstanding Balance divided by (ii) 75% of the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for the
5 trading days prior to the Conversion Date (the conversion price).

TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER
31, 2022 (Unaudited)
(Expressed
in US dollars)
For
the first series of Series A Notes,
the
notes would automatically convert into common stock (in each case, subject to the trading volume of the Company’s common stock
being a minimum of $500,000 for each trading day in the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the conversion date), upon
the earlier to occur of (i) the Company’s common stock being listed on a national securities exchange, in which event the conversion
price would be equal to 75% of the volume weighted average price of the common stock for the 20 trading days prior to the conversion
date, or (ii) upon the closing of the Company’s next equity round of financing for gross proceeds of greater than $5,000,000, in
which event the conversion price would be equal to 75% of the price per share of the common stock (or of the conversion price in the
event of the sale of securities convertible into common stock) sold in such financing. The Company could, at its discretion redeem the
notes for 115% of their face value plus accrued interest.
For
second series of Series A Notes, the notes could be converted into shares of common stock, at the option of the holder, commencing six
months from issuance, at a conversion price equal to the lower of $ 4.00
per share or 75% of the volume weighted average
price of the common stock for the five trading days prior to the conversion date
For
the second series of Series A Notes,
the
notes would automatically convert into common stock (in each case, subject to the trading volume of the Company’s common stock
being a minimum of $500,000 for each trading day in the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the conversion date), upon
the earlier to occur of (i) the Company’s common stock being listed on a national securities exchange, in which event the conversion
price would be equal to the lower of $4.00 per share or 75% of the volume weighted average price of the common stock for the 20 trading
days prior to the conversion date, or (ii) upon the closing of the Company’s next equity round of financing for gross proceeds
of greater than $5,000,000, in which event the conversion price would be equal to the lower of $4.00 per share or 75% of the price per
share of the common stock (or of the conversion price in the event of the sale of securities convertible into common stock) sold in such
financing. The Company could, at its discretion redeem the notes for 115% of their face value plus accrued interest.
The
Company was obligated to issue warrants that accompany the convertible notes and provide 50% warrant coverage. The warrants have a 3-year
term from date of issuance and an exercise price that is 120% of the 20-day volume weighted average price of the Company’s common
shares at the time final closing.
The
Company was obligated to pay the placement agent of the first series of Series A Notes a 12% cash fee for $8,925,550 (face value) of
the notes and 2.5% cash fee and other sundry expenses for the remaining $2,350,000 (face value) of the notes.
Net
proceeds to the Company from Series A Notes issuance up to March 31, 2021 amounted to $ 10,135,690
after payment of the relevant financing related
fees.
The
Company was also obligated to issue warrants to the placement agent that have a 10-year term and cover 12% of funds raised for $8,925,550
(face value) of the notes (first series) and 2.5% of funds raised for the remaining $2,350,000 (face value) of notes (second series),
with an exercise price that is 120% of the 20-day volume weighted average price of the Company’s common shares at the time final
closing. On final closing, which occurred on January 8, 2021, the warrants’ exercise price was struck at $1.06 per share.
Prior
to January 8, 2021 (final closing date), the Company determined that the conversion and redemption features, investor warrants and placement
agent warrants contained in those Notes represented a single compound derivative liability that meets the requirements for liability
classification under ASC 815. The Company accounted for these obligations by determining the fair value of the related derivative liabilities
associated with the embedded conversion and redemption features, as well as investor warrants and placement agent warrants.

(Expressed

Subsequently,
the exercise price of all warrants was concluded and locked to $ 1.06
as of January 8, 2021. Since the exercise price
was no longer a variable, the Company concluded that the noteholder and placement agent warrants should no longer be accounted for as
a derivative liability in accordance with ASC 815 guidelines related to equity indexation and classification. The derivative liabilities
related to those warrants were therefore marked to market as of January 8, 2021 and then transferred to equity (collectively, “End
of warrants derivative treatment”). Therefore, the remaining derivative liabilities only related to the conversion and redemption
features of the convertible notes.
For
the Series A Notes, The Company recognized debt issuance costs in the amount of $ 2,301,854
and treated these as a deduction from the convertible
note liabilities directly, as a contra-liability, and amortized the debt issuance cost over the term of the Notes. The Company also recognized
initial debt discount in the amount of $ 8,088,003
and accreted the interest over the remaining
lives of those Notes. The debt issuance costs were fully amortized as of March 31, 2022.
As
at March 31, 2022, $ 700,000
of Series A Notes remained unconverted and outstanding,
which was equal to the face value of the relevant convertible notes. There was no conversion of Series A Notes during the nine months
ended December 31, 2022.
On December 30, 2022, the Company exchanged $ 500,000
of Series A Notes along with its outstanding interest accrual of $ 121,500
into a new convertible note with the same note holder. The new convertible note has principal of $ 621,500 ,
stated interest rate of
12 % ,
as well as option to convert outstanding principal and accrued interest at the conversion price, calculated at
75 %
multiplied by the average of the three lowest closing prices during the previous ten trading days prior to the receipt of the
conversion notice. The new convertible note matures on December 30, 2023. The Company had concluded that this exchange transaction is
an extinguishment of the original convertible note. Therefore, the Company recorded the new convertible note at fair value, which was
its face value of $ 621,500
net of a discount of $ 64,636 .
The difference between the fair value of the original convertible note immediately prior to the extinguishment and the fair value of
the new convertible note is $ 64,636 .
This amount was recorded as a gain upon debt extinguishment and was included in other income on the income statement. In addition, the
Company had assessed fair value of the derivative liability associated with the conversion option on the original note immediately before
the modification, as well as the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the new convertible note. The difference $ 14,083
was recognized as other expense
[Note 8].
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 50,400
of interest accruals for the Series A Notes.
In connection with the foregoing, the Company relied upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, for transactions not involving a public offering.
Series
B Convertible Notes
In
addition, during the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company also issued $ 1,312,500
(face value) of convertible promissory notes
(“Series B Notes”) to various accredited investors.
Commencing
six months following the issuance date, and at any time thereafter, subject to the Company’s Conversion Buyout clause, at the sole
election of the holder, any amount of the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the note (the “outstanding balance”)
could be converted into that number of shares of Common Stock equal to: (i) the outstanding balance divided by (ii) the Conversion Price.
Partial conversions of the note shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of the note.
The
holder may exercise such conversion right by providing written notice to the Company of such exercise in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Company (a “conversion notice”). Conversion price means (subject in all cases to proportionate adjustment for stock
splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions), seventy-five percent (75%) multiplied by the average of the three (3) lowest closing
prices during the previous ten (10) trading days prior to the receipt of the conversion notice.
The
Series B Notes will automatically convert into common stock upon a merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization,
as a result of which the Company’s common stock shall be changed into another class or classes of stock of the Company or another
entity, or in the case of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company other than a complete liquidation of the
Company. Within the first 180 days after the issuance date, the Company may, at its discretion redeem the notes for 115% of their face
value plus accrued interest. The Company is obligated to issue warrants that accompany the convertible notes and provide 50% warrant
coverage.
The warrants have a
3 -year
term from date of issuance and an exercise price that is $ 1.06
per share for
100,000
warrant shares and $ 1.5
per share for
212,500
warrant shares.

Net
proceeds to the Company from convertible note issuances to March 31, 2021 amounted to $ 1,240,000
after the original issuance discount as well
as payment of the financing related fees. The Company determined that the conversion and redemption features contained in the Series
B Notes represented a single compound derivative liability that meets the requirements for liability classification under ASC 815. The
Company accounted for these obligations by determining the fair value of the related derivative liability associated with the embedded
conversion and redemption features.
The
Company recognized debt issuance costs in the amount of $ 10,000
and treated these as a deduction from the convertible
note liabilities directly, as a contra-liability, and amortized the debt issuance cost over the term of the Series B Notes. The Company
recognized initial debt discount in the amount of $ 1,312,500
and accreted the interest over the remaining
lives of those notes. The debt issuance costs were fully amortized as of March 31, 2022.
As
at March 31, 2022, $ 840,000
of Series B Notes remained unconverted and outstanding,
which was equal to the face value of the relevant convertible notes.
During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, $ 153,600
and $ 555,600
(face value) of Series B Notes were converted

During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, $ 53,250
(face value) of Series B Notes were redeemed
by cash payment of $ 61,238 .
The redemption price was determined in accordance
to the Series B note agreement, where the Company has an option to redeem the note at 115% of its principal value instead of converting
the note upon receipt of a conversion notice. The difference between the redemption cash payment and the book value of the note redeemed,
including the derivative liability associated to the note , was $ 9,991 ,
and was recognized as a gain upon convertible note repayment .
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded accrued interest in the amount of $ 82,509
related to the Series B Notes. In connection
with the foregoing, the Company relied upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, for transactions not involving a public offering.
In
total, as at December 31, 2022, the Company had issued $ 200,000
and $ 231,150
for Series A and Series B notes, respectively,
that remained outstanding beyond their contractual maturity date. These continued to accrue interest, and no repayment demands were received
from noteholders, notwithstanding the fact that these noteholders have continued to convert portions of these notes subsequently, and
it is management’s expectation that all of these notes will eventually convert. In connection with the foregoing, the Company relied
upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for transactions not involving
a public offering.

Stock-based compensation
On
February 2, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Company’s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”).
The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing an incentive to attract, retain
and reward persons performing services for the Company and by motivating such persons to contribute to the growth and profitability of
the Company. The Plan seeks to achieve this purpose by providing for awards in the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other stock-based
awards.
The
Plan shall continue in effect until its termination by the board of directors or committee formed by the board; provided, however, that
all awards shall be granted, if at all, on or before the day immediately preceding the tenth (10 th ) anniversary of the effective
date. The maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the Plan shall be equal to
3,750,000
shares; provided that the maximum number of shares
of stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to awards shall automatically and without any further Company or shareholder approval,
increase on January 1 of each year for not more than 10 years from the effective date, so the number of shares that may be issued is
an amount no greater than 20% of the Company’s outstanding shares of stock and shares of stock underlying any outstanding exchangeable
shares as of such January 1; provided further that no such increase shall be effective if it would violate any applicable law or stock
exchange rule or regulation, or result in adverse tax consequences to the Company or any participant that would not otherwise result
but for the increase.
Based
on the 2016 Option Plan, the Company is authorized to issue employee options with a
10 -year
term. On March 31, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the amendment of certain prior options grants, issued to current
employees, previously issued with a
3 -year
term, such that the respective options issued under these agreements would have their term extended to
10
years. The Company revalued these options using
a lattice model with an expected life of
10
years, risk free rates of
0.46 %
to
0.75 %,
stock price of $ 0.974
and expected volatility of
132.2 %,
in order to recognize the additional expense associated with the longer term and recognized a one-time charge of $ 1,600,515
in share-based compensation, with a corresponding
adjustment to adjusted paid in capital.
During
the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company granted
10,180
of options with a weighted average remaining
contractual life of
10
years. The Company recorded stock-based compensation
of $ 149,190
in connection with ESOP 2016 Plan (June 30, 2021
- $ 155,851 ),
under general and administrative expenses with corresponding credit to additional paid in capital.
During
the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company granted
3,757
of options with a weighted average remaining
contractual life of
10
years. The Company recorded stock-based compensation

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The
Company’s management has evaluated subsequent events up to February 14, 2023, the date the condensed consolidated financial statements
were issued, pursuant to the requirements of ASC 855, and has determined the following material subsequent events:
On January 23, 2023,
the Company issued a new convertible note to an individual in the amount of $ 2,000,000
(“principal amount”). This note bears interest with a fixed rate of
10 %
for its entire 18-month term, paid in advance through the issuance of common stock. On January 23, the company issued
270,270
shares to this individual in payment of this interest, using a share price of $ 0.74
per share, which is a strike price equal to the lowest Company stock price on the note issuance
date. The note maybe repaid in cash, or via conversion of note principal, subject to mutual consent of the Company and the note holder,
at
15 %
discount to the stock’s VWAP on the conversion date. In addition, the note holder has the option to convert, after a qualified
financing through the earlier of the prepayment date or maturity date, all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest thereon,
based upon a conversion price equal to a
20 %
discount to the lessor of (i) the actual price per new round of stock based on qualified financing, (ii) if there be no qualified financing
as of the maturity date, by mutual consent and election of the Company and the note holder, at
15 %
discount to average VWAP for ten consecutive trading days immediately prior to the maturity date.

Company
Overview
Biotricity
Inc. (the “Company”, “Biotricity”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a medical technology
company focused on biometric data monitoring solutions. Our aim is to deliver innovative, remote monitoring solutions to the medical,
healthcare, and consumer markets, with a focus on diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for lifestyle and chronic illnesses. We approach
the diagnostic side of remote patient monitoring by applying innovation within existing business models where reimbursement is established.
We believe this approach reduces the risk associated with traditional medical device development and accelerates the path to revenue.
In post-diagnostic markets, we intend to apply medical grade biometrics to enable consumers to self-manage, thereby driving patient compliance
and reducing healthcare costs. We intend to first focus on a segment of the diagnostic mobile cardiac telemetry market, otherwise known
as MCT, while providing our chosen markets with the capability to also perform other cardiac studies.
We
developed our FDA-cleared Bioflux® MCT technology, comprised of a monitoring device and software components, which we made available
to the market under limited release on April 6, 2018, in order to assess, establish and develop sales processes and market dynamics.
The fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 marked the Company’s first year of expanded commercialization efforts, focused on sales growth
and expansion. We have expanded our sales efforts to 20 states, with intention to expand further and compete in the broader US market
using an insourcing business model. Our technology has a large potential total addressable market, which can include hospitals, clinics
and physicians’ offices, as well as other Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (“IDTFs)”. We believe our solution’s
insourcing model, which empowers physicians with state-of-the-art technology and charges technology service fees for its use, has the
benefit of a reduced operating overhead for the Company, and enables a more efficient market penetration and distribution strategy.
34
We
are a technology company focused on earning utilization-based recurring technology fee revenue. The Company’s ability to grow this
type of revenue is predicated on the size and quality of its sales force and their ability to penetrate the market and place devices
with clinically focused, repeat users of its cardiac study technology. The Company plans to grow its sales force in order to address
new markets and achieve sales penetration in the markets currently served.
Full
market release of the Bioflux MCT device for commercialization launched in April 2019, after receiving its second and final required
FDA clearance. To commence commercialization, we ordered device inventory from our FDA-approved manufacturer and hired a small, captive
sales force, with deep experience in cardiac technology sales; we expanded on our limited market release, which identified potential
anchor clients who could be early adopters of our technology. By increasing our sales force and geographic footprint, we had launched
sales in 31 U.S. states by December 31, 2022.
On
January 24, 2022 the Company announced that it has received the 510(k) FDA clearance of its Biotres patch solution, which is a novel
product in the field of Holter monitoring. This three-lead technology can provide connected Holter monitoring that is designed to produce
more accurate arrythmia detection than is typical of competing remote patient monitoring solutions. It is also foundational, since already
developed improvements to this technology will follow which are not known by the Company to be currently available in the market, for
clinical and consumer patch solution applications.
During
2021, the Company also announced that it received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its Bioflux Software II System, engineered to improve
workflows and reduce estimated analysis time from 5 minutes to 30 seconds. ECG monitoring requires significant human oversight to review
and interpret incoming patient data to discern actionable events for clinical intervention, highlighting the necessity of driving operational
efficiency. This improvement in analysis time reduces operational costs and allows the company to continue to focus on excellent customer
service and industry-leading response times to physicians and their at-risk patients. Additionally, these advances mean we can focus
our resources on high-level operations and sales.
The
Company has also developed or is developing several other ancillary technologies, which will require application for further FDA clearances,
which the Company anticipates applying for within the next to twelve months. Among these are:
●
advanced
ECG analysis software that can analyze and synthesize patient ECG monitoring data with the purpose of distilling it down to the important
information that requires clinical intervention, while reducing the amount of human intervention necessary in the process;
●
the
Bioflux® 2.0, which is the next generation of our award winning Bioflux®
During
2021 and the early part of 2022, the Company has also commercially launched its Bioheart technology, which is a consumer technology whose
development was forged out of prior the development of the clinical technologies that are already part of the Company’s technology
ecosystem, the BioSphere. In October 2022, the Company launched its Biocare Cardiac Disease Management Solution, after successfully piloting
this technology in two facilities that provide cardiac care to more than 60,000 patients. This technology and other consumer technologies
and applications such as the Biokit and Biocare have been developed to allow the Company to transform and use its strong cardiac footprint
to expand into remote chronic care management solutions that will be part of the BioSphere. The technology puts actionable data into
the hands of physicians in order to assist them in making effective treatment decisions quickly. In recognition of its product development,
in November 2022, the Company’s Bioheart received recognition as one of Time Magazine’s Best Inventions of 2022.
The
COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring technologies. During the nine months ended
December 31, 2021, the Company has continued to develop a telemedicine platform, with capabilities of real-time streaming of medical
devices. Telemedicine offers patients the ability to communicate directly with their health care providers without the need of leaving
their home. The introduction of a telemedicine solution is intended to align with the Company’s Bioflux product and facilitate
remote visits and remote prescriptions for cardiac diagnostics, but it will also serve as a means of establishing referral and other
synergies across the network of doctors and patients that use the technologies we are building within the Biotricity ecosystem. The intention
is to continue to provide improved care to patients that may otherwise elect not to go to medical facilities and continue to provide
economic benefits and costs savings to healthcare service providers and payers that reimburse. The Company’s goal is to position
itself as an all-in-one cardiac diagnostic and disease management solution. The Company continue continues to grow its data set of billions
of patient heartbeats, allowing it to further develop its predictive capabilities relative to atrial fibrillation and arrythmias.
35
The
Company identified the importance of recent developments in accelerating its path to profitability, including the launch of important
new products identified, which have a ready market through cross-selling to existing large customer clinics, and large new distribution
partnerships that allow the Company to sell into large hospital networks. Additionally, in September 2022, the Company was awarded a
NIH Grant from the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute for AI-Enabled real-time monitoring, and predictive analytics for stroke
due to chronic kidney failure. This is a significant achievement that broadens our technology platform’s disease space demographic.
The grant will focus on Bioflux-AI, as an innovative system for real-time monitoring and prediction of stroke episodes in chronic kidney
disease patients.
Results
of Operations
During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company earned combined device sales and technology fee income totaling $2.5 million
and $6.9 million. This represents a 27% and a 25% increase from the corresponding comparable periods in fiscal 2021, respectively. Revenue
growth has improved from recent prior reporting periods, which were affected by the impacted of COVID on customer clinic operations and
closures across the US, including the Omicron variant which afflicted many of the US states that the Company operates in, and impeded
the ability of company sales professionals to engage in certain in-person sales meetings with their customers.
During
the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a net loss (prior to the adjustment for preferred stock dividends)
of $4.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively, as well as a comprehensive loss of approximately $4.8 million and $14.1 million, respectively.
During the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a net loss (prior to the adjustment for preferred stock
dividends) of $7.1 million and $23.5 million, respectively, as well as a comprehensive loss of approximately $7.4 million and $24.2 million,
respectively. This resulted in a net loss per common share of $0.091 and $0.283 per share for the three months and nine months ended
December 31, 2022, respectively (2021: $0.149 and $0.554).
For
the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022, Biotricity’s net loss included one-time expenses related to convertible
note conversions, one-time expenses related to deb extinguishments, as well as one-time fair value adjustments on derivative liabilities.
Normalized loss per common share, adjusted for these one-time expenses, are illustrated in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA section below.
During the three months ended December
31, 2022, the Company successfully signed agreements with two leading US medical device distributors and one Group Purchasing Organization
(“GPO”) as major components of its market strategy to large medical networks and hospitals. Given an established ecosystem
of state-of-the-art remote cardiac solutions, and newly established large distribution relationships, management anticipates increased
demand for cardiac services in the coming quarters. This expectation is reflected in management’s decision to increase its inventory
build and continue to focus on identifying and acquiring professional sales talent required to support continuous improvement in the
growth trajectory of the Company’s revenues.
Three
and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022
Operating
Revenues and Expenses
Revenue
and cost of revenue
Total
revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $2.5 million and $6.9 million, respectively, compared to $1.9 million and $5.5
million for the comparable periods in the prior year, respectively. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
experienced a gross margin of 57% and 57%, respectively. The gross margin during the comparable prior year periods was 43% and 57%, respectively.
The change in gross margin form the prior year was the result of increase of technology fee sales as a percentage of total sales, which
has higher gross margins as compared to device sales. Management expects that the cost of devices sold, as well as cellular and other
costs associated with technology fees, will become lower as a percentage of revenues as business sales volumes expand, which it anticipates
will improve and moderate gross margins.
36
Operating
Expenses
Total
operating expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $5.7 million and $17.1 million, respectively, compared
to $5.6 million and $16.0 million for the corresponding prior year periods, respectively, as further described below.
General
and administrative expenses
Our
general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $4.8 million and $14.5 million, respectively,
compared to $4.7 million and $13.9 million for the corresponding prior year periods, respectively. The increase in general and administrative
expenses during the nine month period ended December 31, 2022 was a result of expansion of sales force and marketing initiatives during
the first half of fiscal 2023. General and administrative expenses during the three month period ended December 31 decreased as compared
to prior year, as a result of increased monitoring of spending efficiency.
Research
and development expenses
During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred research and development expenses of $0.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively,
compared to $0.9 million and $2.1 million for the corresponding prior year periods, respectively. The change in research and development
activity was directly related to the timing of development activities associated with the new technologies for our ecosystem and product
enhancements.
Other
(expense) income, and loss upon convertible promissory notes conversion
During the three and nine months ended December
31, 2022, we recognized $119,880 and $116,989 in net other expense, respectively, as compared to net other income of $40,512 and $54,558,
in the corresponding prior year periods, respectively. The change in net other expense is a result of loss upon debt extinguishments
during current year.
In
addition, during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a gain of $5,391 and a loss of $85,537 upon the conversion
of our convertible promissory notes, respectively, as compared to an expense $0.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, during the
comparable prior year periods. The decrease of loss upon conversion is a result of decreased volumes of conversions during fiscal 2023
as compared to prior year.
Accretion
and amortization expenses
During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred accretion and amortization expense related to debt financing of $51,061
and $151,970, respectively, compared to $1.3 million and $8.8 million during the comparable prior year periods, respectively. The decreases
from the prior year comparative periods were as a result of full amortization during the quarter ending March 31, 2022 for the debt discount
related to Series A and Series B convertible notes. Therefore, there was no amortization of Series A and Series B convertible notes debt
discount during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. The remaining amortization in the three and nine months ended December
31. 2022 related to the amortization of debt discount related to the Company’s term loan.
Change
in fair value of derivative liabilities
During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a loss of $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related
to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities associated with preferred shares and convertible notes. The Company recognized
a loss of $0.8 million and $0.7 million during the comparable prior year periods, respectively.
37
EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA
Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-generally
accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial
information in evaluating operating profitability. EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
expenses to net income.
Adjusted
EBITDA is calculated by excluding from EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated
businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items that related to one-time, non-recurring expenditures.
We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness
of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.
Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.
See notes in the table below for additional information regarding special items.
It
is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Biotricity’s GAAP financial
information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other
users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess business performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented

Translation
Adjustment
Translation
adjustment for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was a translation adjustment loss of $72,824 and a gain of $0.6 million.
The company recognized a translation adjustment loss of $20,064 and $1,841 in the corresponding prior year periods, respectively. This
translation adjustment represents gains and losses that result from the translation of currency in the financial statements from our
functional currency of Canadian dollars to the reporting currency in U.S. dollars over the course of the reporting period.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
Company is in commercialization mode, while continuing to pursue the development of its next generation MCT product as well as new products
that are being developed.
We
generally require cash to:
●
purchase
devices that will be placed in the field for pilot projects and to produce revenue,
●
launch
sales initiatives,
●
fund
our operations and working capital requirements,
●
develop
and execute our product development and market introduction plans,
●
fund
research and development efforts, and
●
pay
any expense obligations as they come due.
The
Company is in the early stages of commercializing its products. It is concurrently in development mode, operating a research and development
program in order to develop an ecosystem of medical technologies, and, where required or deemed advisable, obtain regulatory approvals
for, and commercialize other proposed products. The Company launched its first commercial sales program as part of a limited market release,
during the year ended March 31, 2019, using an experienced professional in-house sales team. A full market release ensued during the
year ended March 31, 2020. Management anticipates the Company will continue on its revenue growth trajectory and improve its liquidity
through continued business development and after additional equity or debt capitalization of the Company. The Company has incurred recurring
losses from operations, and as at December 31, 2022, has an accumulated deficit of $107.7 million. On August 30, 2021 the Company completed
an underwritten public offering of its common stock that concurrently facilitated its listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On December
31, 2022, the Company has a working capital deficit of $2.5 million (March 31, 2022 – working capital surplus of $10.5 million).
Prior to listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company had also filed a shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-255544)
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 27, 2021, which was declared effective on May 4, 2021. This facilitates better transactional
preparedness when the Company seeks to issue equity or debt to potential investors, since it continues to allow the Company to offer
its shares to investors only by means of a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, which forms part of an effective registration
statement. As such, the Company has developed and continues to pursue sources of funding that management believes will be sufficient
to support the Company’s operating plan and alleviate any substantial doubt as to its ability to meet its obligations at least
for a period of one year from the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021,
the Company closed a number of private placements offering of convertible notes, which have raised net cash proceeds of $11,375,690 (face
value $12,525,500). As of December 31, 2021, $11,048,000 face value of convertible notes issued during last fiscal year was converted
into common shares. During fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company raised an additional $499,900 through government EIDL loan,
and $250,000 through short term loans. During the fiscal quarter ended Sept 30, 2021, the Company raised total net proceeds of $14,545,805
through the underwritten public offering that was concurrent with its listing onto the Nasdaq Capital Markets. During the fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2021, the Company raised additional net proceeds of $11,756,563 through a term loan transaction (Note 6) and made
repayment of the previously issued promissory notes and short-term loan. In connection with this loan, the Company and Lender also entered
into a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement wherein the Company agreed to secure the Credit Agreement with all of the Company’s assets.
The Company and Lender also entered into an Intellectual Property Security Agreement dated December 21, 2021 wherein the Credit Agreement
is also secured by the Company’s right title and interest in the Company’s Intellectual Property. During the fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2022, the Company raised short-term loans and promissory notes with net proceeds of 1,889,144 from various lenders.
39
As
we proceed with the commercialization of the Bioflux, Biotres and Biocare products and continue their development, we expect to continue
to devote significant resources on capital expenditures, as well as research and development costs and operations, marketing and sales
expenditures.
We
expect to require additional funds to further develop our business plan, including the continuous commercialization and expansion of
the technologies that will form part of its BioSphere eco-system. Based on the current known facts and assumptions, we believe our existing
cash and cash equivalents, access to funding sources, along with anticipated near-term debt and equity financings, will be sufficient
to meet our needs for the next twelve months from the filing date of this report. We intend to seek and opportunistically acquire additional
debt or equity capital to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protecting our
intellectual property, developing or acquiring new lines of business and enhancing our operating infrastructure. The terms of our future
financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek additional funds through
arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. There can be no assurance we will be able to raise this additional capital on
acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to modify our operating
plan and otherwise curtail or slow the pace of development and commercialization of our proposed product lines.
Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we used cash in operating activities of $11.7 million compared to $10.4 million for the corresponding
period of the prior year. These activities involved expenditures for sales, business development, as well as marketing and operating
activities, and continued research and product development.
Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net
cash used by investing activities was $Nil for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021,
net cash used by investing activities was attributed to the purchase of property and equipment of $29,766.
Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net
cash provided by financing activities was $4,119 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $25.0 million cash provided
by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
unaudited condensed consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and are expressed in United States Dollars. Significant accounting policies are
summarized below:
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”)
on April 1, 2018. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by applying
the core principles – 1) identify the contract with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine
the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue as performance
obligations are satisfied.
40
Both
the Bioflux mobile cardiac telemetry device, and the Biotres device are wearable devices. The cardiac data that the devices monitor and
collect is curated and analyzed by the Company’s proprietary algorithms and then securely communicated to a remote monitoring facility
for electronic reporting and conveyance to the patient’s prescribing physician or other certified cardiac medical professional.
Revenues earned are comprised of device sales revenues and technology fee revenues (technology as a service). The devices, together with
their licensed software, are available for sale to the medical center or physician, who is responsible for the delivery of clinical diagnosis
and therapy. The remote monitoring, data collection and reporting services performed by the technology culminate in a patient study that
is generally billable when it is complete and is issued to the physician. In order to recognize revenue, management considers whether
or not the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a commercial arrangement exists, and delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered. For sales of devices, which are invoiced directly, additional revenue recognition criteria include that the price
is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured; for device sales contracts with terms of more than one year, the
Company recognizes any significant financing component as revenue over the contractual period using the effective interest method, and
the associated interest income is reflected accordingly on the statement of operations and included in other income; for revenue that
is earned based on customer usage of the proprietary software to render a patient’s cardiac study, the Company recognizes revenue
when the study ends based on a fixed billing rate. Costs associated with providing the services are recorded as the service is provided
regardless of whether or when revenue is recognized.
The
Company may also earn service-related revenue from contracts with other counterparties with which it consults. This contract work is
separate and distinct from services provided to clinical customers, but may be with a reseller or other counterparties that are working
to establish their operations in foreign jurisdictions or ancillary products or market segments in which the Company has expertise and
may eventually conduct business.
The
Company recognized the following forms of revenue for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Inventory
Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost and market value, cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis. Market value of our inventory,
which is all purchased finished goods, is determined based on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price
less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation. The Company records write-downs of inventory that is obsolete or in excess
of anticipated demand or market value based on consideration of product lifecycle stage, technology trends, product development plans
and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may
have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Inventory write-downs are charged to cost of revenue and establish a new cost basis
for the inventory.
41
Significant
accounting estimates and assumptions
The
preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions to be made in applying the
accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. The estimates and related assumptions are based on previous experiences and other factors considered reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods.
Significant
accounts that require estimates as the basis for determining the stated amounts include share-based compensation, impairment analysis
and fair value of warrants, structured notes, convertible debt and conversion liabilities.
●
Fair
value of stock options
The
Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of equity instruments at the date
at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share-based payments requires determining the most appropriate valuation model for
a grant of such instruments, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. The estimate also requires determining the
most appropriate inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model, including the expected life of the instrument, risk-free rate, volatility,
and dividend yield.
●
Fair
value of warrants
In
determining the fair value of the warrant issued for services and issue pursuant to financing transactions, the Company used the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility rate, risk-free rate, and the remaining expected life of the warrants
that are classified under equity.
●
Fair
value of derivative liabilities
In
determining the fair values of the derivative liabilities from the conversion and redemption features, the Company used valuation models
with the following assumptions: dividend yields, volatility, risk-free rate and the remaining expected life. Changes in those assumptions
and inputs could in turn impact the fair value of the derivative liabilities and can have a material impact on the reported loss and
comprehensive loss for the applicable reporting period.
●
Functional
currency
Determining
the appropriate functional currencies for entities in the Company requires analysis of various factors, including the currencies and
country-specific factors that mainly influence labor, materials, and other operating expenses.
●
Useful
life of property and equipment
The
Company employs significant estimates to determine the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, considering industry trends
such as technological advancements, past experience, expected use and review of asset useful lives. The Company makes estimates when
determining depreciation methods, depreciation rates and asset useful lives, which requires considering industry trends and company-specific
factors. The Company reviews depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values annually or when circumstances change and adjusts
its depreciation methods and assumptions prospectively
42
●
Provisions
Provisions
are recognized when the Company has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a previous event, if it is probable that
the Company will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. The amount recognized is
the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account
the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to
reflect the current best estimate of the expected future cash flows.
●
Contingencies
Contingencies
can be either possible assets or possible liabilities arising from past events, which, by their nature, will be resolved only when one
or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential impact of contingencies inherently
involves the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.
●
Inventory
obsolescence
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost and market value. Market value of our inventory, which is all purchased finished goods, is determined
based on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation.
The Company estimates net realizable value as the amount at which inventories are expected to be sold, taking into consideration fluctuations
in retail prices less estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories are written down to net realizable value when the cost
of inventories is estimated to be unrecoverable due to obsolescence, damage, or declining selling prices.
●
Income
and other taxes
The
calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise judgment regarding
the carrying values of assets and liabilities which are subject to accounting estimates inherent in those balances, the interpretation
of income tax legislation across various jurisdictions, expectations about future operating results, the timing of reversal of temporary
differences and possible audits of income tax filings by the tax authorities. In addition, when the Company incurs losses for income
tax purposes, it assesses the probability of taxable income being available in the future based on its budgeted forecasts. These forecasts
are adjusted to take into account certain non-taxable income and expenses and specific rules on the use of unused credits and tax losses.
When
the forecasts indicate that sufficient future taxable income will be available to deduct the temporary differences, a deferred tax asset
is recognized for all deductible temporary differences. Changes or differences in underlying estimates or assumptions may result in changes
to the current or deferred income tax balances on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, a charge or credit to income tax expense
included as part of net income (loss) and may result in cash payments or receipts. Judgment includes consideration of the Company’s
future cash requirements in its tax jurisdictions. All income, capital and commodity tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments.
Changes in interpretations or judgments may result in a change in the Company’s income, capital, or commodity tax provisions in
the future. The amount of such a change cannot be reasonably estimated.
●
Incremental
borrowing rate for lease
The
determination of the Company’s lease obligation and right-of-use asset depends on certain assumptions, which include the selection
of the discount rate. The discount rate is set by reference to the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Significant assumptions
are required to be made when determining which borrowing rates to apply in this determination. Changes in the assumptions used may have
a significant effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
43
Earnings
(Loss) Per Share
The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 260-10 which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share
includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in
the earnings of an entity. Diluted earnings per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There
were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Cash
Cash
includes cash on hand and balances with banks.
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
functional currency of the Company’s Canadian-based subsidiary is the Canadian dollar and the US-based parent is the U.S. dollar.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using
the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate
on the date of the transaction. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included
in net income (loss) for the year. In translating the financial statements of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries from their functional
currency into the Company’s reporting currency of United States dollars, balance sheet accounts are translated using the closing
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate prevailing
during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation, if any, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) in stockholders’ equity. The Company has not, to the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements, entered
into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable consists of amounts due to the Company from medical facilities, which receive reimbursement from institutions and third-party
government and commercial payors and their related patients, as a result of the Company’s normal business activities. Accounts
receivable is reported on the balance sheets net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance
for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible receivables based on historical experience, assessment of specific risk, review of
outstanding invoices, and various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and recognizes
the provision as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance
after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted and when it is deemed that a balance is uncollectible.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
ASC
820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements
of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
●
Level 1 – Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2 – Valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 3 – Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring management’s
best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value.
44
In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective
carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these
instruments or interest rates that are comparable to market rates. These financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, deposits
and other receivables, convertible promissory notes and short term loans, federally-guaranteed loans, term loans and accounts payable
and accrued liabilities. The Company’s cash and derivative liabilities, which are carried at fair values, are classified as a Level
1 and Level 3, respectively. The Company’s bank accounts are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore,
bear minimal credit risk.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of
the assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation
of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follow:
Office
equipment
5
years
Leasehold
improvement
5
years
Impairment
for Long-Lived Assets
The
Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. ASC 360 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets, including right-of-use
assets, used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner,
except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal. Based on its review at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company believes
there was no impairment of its long-lived assets.
Leases
The
Company is the lessee in a lease contract when the Company obtains the right to use the asset. Operating leases are included in the line
items right-of-use asset, lease obligation, current, and lease obligation, long-term in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Right-of-use
(“ROU”) asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease obligations represent
the Company’s obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease, both of which are recognized based on the present value
of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception
are not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations. The Company determines the lease term by agreement with lessor. As the Company’s lease does
not provide implicit interest rate, the Company uses the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available
at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion.
45
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. The Company provides for Federal, State and Provincial income taxes payable,
as well as for those deferred because of the timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes
versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recoverable or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the
period of the change. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized.
Research
and Development
Research
and development costs, which relate primarily to product and software development, are charged to operations as incurred. Under certain
research and development arrangements with third parties, the Company may be required to make payments that are contingent on the achievement
of specific developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Before a product receives regulatory approval, milestone payments
made to third parties are expensed when the milestone is achieved .
Milestone payments made to third parties after regulatory approval
is received are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the approved product.
Stock
Based Compensation
The
Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with the provision of ASC 718, which requires that all share-based payments issued
to acquire goods or services, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their
fair values, net of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation expense related to share-based awards is recognized
over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
The
Company accounts for stock based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the
fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable,
using the guidelines in ASC 505-50. The Company issues compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management,
accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services.
Convertible
Notes Payable and Derivative Instruments
The
Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-11 to account for the down round features of warrants issued with private placements effective
as of April 1, 2017. In doing so, warrants with a down round feature previously treated as derivative liabilities in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet and measured at fair value are henceforth treated as equity, with no adjustment for changes in fair value at each reporting
period. Previously, the Company accounted for conversion options embedded in convertible notes in accordance with ASC 815. ASC 815 generally
requires companies to bifurcate conversion options embedded in convertible notes from their host instruments and to account for them
as free-standing derivative financial instruments. ASC 815 provides for an exception to this rule when convertible notes, as host instruments,
are deemed to be conventional, as defined by ASC 815-40. The Company accounts for convertible notes deemed conventional and conversion
options embedded in non-conventional convertible notes which qualify as equity under ASC 815, in accordance with the provisions of ASC
470-20, which provides guidance on accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features. Accordingly, the Company
records, as a discount to convertible notes, the intrinsic value of such conversion options based upon the differences between the fair
value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the
note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt.
46
Preferred
Shares Extinguishments
The
Company accounted for preferred stock redemptions and conversions in accordance to ASU-260-10-S99. For preferred stock redemptions and
conversion, the difference between the fair value of consideration transferred to the holders of the preferred stock and the carrying
amount of the preferred stock is accounted as deemed dividend distribution and subtracted from net income.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time communicated to the Company’s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e). The Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the Company’s desired disclosure control
objectives. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Therefore,
even a system which is determined to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented.
Our systems of internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
At
the end of the period being reported upon, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the material information
required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and financial officer, as well as recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms relating to the Company.
Changes
in Internal Controls
There
were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three-month period ended December
31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
