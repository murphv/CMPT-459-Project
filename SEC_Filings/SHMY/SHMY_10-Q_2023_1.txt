SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
These
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America (“US GAAP”).
The
accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
balances were eliminated in consolidation.
Below
is the organization chart of the Group.
Use
of Estimates
In
preparing these financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
Our
deposit in Malaysia is currently deposit in Public Bank Berhad and Standard Chartered Bank (Malaysia) Berhad, and there is a Perbadanan
Insurans Deposit Malaysia protects our eligible deposits held with bank in Malaysia which is members of the Scheme. The scheme will pay
a compensation up to a limit of Malaysia Ringgit (“MYR”)
250,000
per deposit per member bank, which is equivalent to $ 56,787
if the aforementioned banks fail.

Inventories
Inventories
consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due
to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and
promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of
revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Revenue
recognition
Revenue
is generated through sale of goods and delivery services. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or
services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods
or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive
in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount:
(i)
identification of the promised goods and services in the contract;
(ii)
determination of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context
of the contract;
(iii)
measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
(v)
recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The
Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under Topic 606, the Company records revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. The Company
records revenue from the sale of product upon shipment or delivery of the products to the customer. The Company doesn’t allow return
of the products purchased or refund unless the food delivered is spoilt.
Cost
of revenue
Cost
of revenue includes the purchase cost of raw material for manufacturing and distribute to customers and packing materials. It includes
purchasing and receiving costs, internal transfer costs, other costs of distribution network, opening and closing inventory net off discount
received and return outwards in cost of revenue.
Income
tax expense
Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC Topic 740”). Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclosed in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740,
tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
The
Company conducts major businesses in Malaysia and is subject to tax in their own jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities,
the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities.
F- 7
Foreign
currencies translation
Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The
functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have been
expressed in US$. In addition, the Company’s subsidiary maintains its books and record in Malaysia Ringgits (“MYR”)
and United States Dollars (“US$”), which is the respective functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic
environment in which the entity operates.
In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into
US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “Translation of Financial Statement”, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet
date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation
of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
Translation
of amounts from the local currency of the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:

Related
parties
Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.
Fair
value of financial instruments
The
carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, trade receivable, deposits and other receivables,
amount due to related parties and other payables approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial
instruments.
The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820-10”),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level
1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level
2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level
3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements, at least annually, on a recurring basis, nor did the Company have any assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Net
Income/(Loss) per Share
The
Company calculates net income/(loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic income/(loss)
per share is computed by dividing the net income/(loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income/(loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the
number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if
the additional common shares were dilutive.
F- 8
Lease
The
Company adopted the ASU No. 2016-02, on April 1, 2019 (date of inception). The Company leases central kitchen and restaurants for fixed
periods pre-emptive extension options. The Company recognizes lease payments for its short-term lease on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial
direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line
basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease.
In
determining the present value of the unpaid lease payments, ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company
leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. The Company
incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments. As
of December 31, 2022, the Company have no operating lease.
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards
Recent
accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s
present or future financial statements.

GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company having accumulated
deficit of $ 2,119,697
and $ 1,599,531
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company suffered from a net loss of $ 520,166
and $ 305,478
respectively.
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded operating cash outflows of $ 295,748
and $ 344,975
in operating
activities respectively.
Furthermore,
the Company recorded a negative working capital of $ 1,381,920
and $ 1,188,819
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 respectively.
The
Company’s cash position is not sufficient to support the Company’s daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability
of its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and the ability to acquire financial support from
its shareholder.
These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date that financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not
being able to continue as a going concern.

Overview
We
share the same business plan as that of our subsidiaries. We are engaged in the production and sale of food products, specifically dessert
created and sold through various restaurants that we operate in Malaysia. We sell our goods under our brand name “Sweet Hut.”
We have two dessert restaurant and one central kitchen.
It
is worth highlighting that, on 15 June 2021, Malaysia Government introduced a four-phase National Recovery Plan (herein and after referred
the “NRP”) to help the country emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. As each phase is based on the
number of new cases, people requiring ICU treatment, and vaccination rates, it can be extended, or moved on to the next phase, whenever
possible.
Phase
1 - Conditions are the same as “total lockdown” launched from 1 June 2021. No social gatherings, dine-in eating at restaurants,
interstate travel and non-essential services are permitted. Any remaining workplaces are required to have their workers work from their
homes. This phase, based on the critical condition of the healthcare services, may last until end of July.
Phase
2 - If more people are vaccinated, ICU bed usage reduced to a moderate level; and new cases fall below 4,000, the country will move on
to the next phase which allows more economic sectors to resume operation.
Phase
3 - Once daily cases are reduced to 2,000, the healthcare system has returned to a manageable level; ICU cases have been reduced to an
adequate amount; and 40% of the people have been vaccinated. All economic sectors will be allowed to operate and most importantly dining
in restaurants and cafes will be allowed. This phase will be expected to start on late August.
Phase
4 - Once daily cases have dropped to 500, the healthcare system becomes safe as ICU cases become low enough; and 60% of the people have
been vaccinated. This phase will be expected to start on late October.
The
Company’s central kitchen and two restaurants were and will continue to operate throughout each phase of NRP.
On October 31, 2022, the Company terminated all
the tenancy agreements before the due date of the agreements.
On November 30, 2022, the Company has entered into a lease agreement with
a third party, Sweet Bakery & Dessert Cafe Sdn Bhd to lease their assets to the third party. The leasing period is commencing from
January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. The Company did not cease its business operation nor sell the operating assets. The Company is looking for a new
strategic location to continue their business while leasing out their assets to the third party.

The

One being the closure of previous four restaurants since September 2020 and launching of two brand new restaurants in C180 and Sri Petaling
which commence operation on February and June 2021, respectively for business rebranding purpose and another being adversely impacted
by COVID-19 Movement Control Order imposed by Malaysia Government. On October 31, 2022, the Company terminated all the tenancy agreements and therefore do not generate any revenue

ITEM
4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:
We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to
a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties and
effective risk assessment; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the
requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines; and (4) lack of internal audit function due to the fact that the Company
lacks qualified resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit
function are yet to be developed.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
