NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Use of Estimates
The accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of the Company’s financial statements
in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, incremental borrowing rates and recognition
of renewal options for operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The estimates that we make include allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation, impairment analysis of long-lived
assets, income tax assets and liabilities, fair value of marketable securities and revenue recognition. Estimates are based on historical
experience where applicable or other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The interim financial statements are prepared pursuant to the instructions
for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulations S-X of the SEC Rules and Regulations. The July 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet
was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The interim financial statements
and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company's latest Form 10-K Annual
Report for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments
of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. The results of operations for the current
period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year ending July 31, 2023 or any other period.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in bank accounts
for tenant security deposits and other amounts required under certain loan agreements.
Accounts Receivable
Generally, rent is due from tenants at the beginning of the month
in accordance with terms of each lease. Based upon its periodic assessment of the quality of the receivables, management uses its historical
knowledge of the tenants and industry experience to determine whether a reserve or write-off is required. The Company uses specific identification
to write-off receivables to bad debt expense in the period when issues of collectibility become known. Collectibility issues include late
rent payments, circumstances when a tenant indicates their intention to vacate the property without paying, or when tenant litigation
or bankruptcy proceedings are not expected to result in full payment. Management also assesses collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable
on an aggregate basis where similar characteristics exist. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers
past due status and a tenant’s payment history. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
of future economic conditions. Our assessment considers volatility in market conditions and evolving shifts in credit trends that may
have a material impact on our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables in future periods.
As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, and primarily because of
the lingering effects of COVID-19, the Company recorded an allowance for uncollectible receivables in the amount of $ 159,000
and $ 393,000 ,
respectively, as an offset to receivables.

expense for each period follows:

Index
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated
using the straight-line method and the declining-balance method. Amortization of improvements to leased property is calculated over the
life of the lease. Lives used to determine depreciation and amortization are generally as follows:
Buildings and improvements
18 - 40
years
Improvements to leased property
3 - 10
years
Fixtures and equipment
7 - 12
years
Other
3 - 5
years
Maintenance, repairs, renewals and improvements of a non-permanent
nature are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for additions and major renewals or improvements are capitalized along with
the associated interest cost during construction. The cost of assets sold or retired, and the accumulated depreciation or amortization
thereon are eliminated from the respective accounts in the year of disposal, and the resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to
income. Capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset’s estimated useful
life.
Impairment
The Company reviews property and equipment and related lease intangibles
for possible impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable
through operations plus estimated disposition proceeds. Events or changes in circumstances that may occur include, but are not limited
to, significant changes in real estate market conditions, estimated residual values, and an expectation to sell assets before the end
of the previously estimated life. Impairments are measured to the extent the current book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the
asset less disposition costs for any assets classified as held for sale. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company has determined
there was no impairment of its property and equipment.
Deferred Charges
Deferred charges consist principally of costs incurred in connection
with the leasing of property to tenants. Such costs are amortized over the related lease periods, ranging from
4
to
21
years, using the
straight-line method. If a lease is terminated early, such costs are expensed.
Leases - Lessor Revenue
The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) 2014-09 (Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Rental income is recognized from tenants under executed leases
no later than on an established date or on an earlier date if the tenant should commence conducting business. Unbilled receivables are
included in accounts receivable and represent the excess of scheduled rental income recognized on a straight-line basis over rental income
as it becomes receivable according to the provisions of the lease. The effect of lease modifications that result in rent relief or other
credits to tenants, including any retroactive effects relating to prior periods, are recognized in the period when the lease modification
is signed. At the time of the lease modification, we assess the realizability of any accrued but unpaid rent and amounts that had been
recognized as revenue in prior periods. As lessor, we have elected to combine the lease components (base rent), non-lease components (reimbursements
of common area maintenance expenses) and reimbursements of real estate taxes and account for the components as a single lease component
in accordance with ASC 842. If the amounts are not determined to be realizable, the accrued but unpaid rent is written off. Accounts receivable
are recognized in accordance with lease agreements at its net realizable value. Rental payments received in advance are deferred until
earned.
In April 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a
Staff Q&A on accounting for leases during the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on the application of lease guidance in ASC Topic 842, Leases
(“ASC 842”). The Q&A states that it would be acceptable to make a policy election regarding rent concessions resulting
from COVID-19, which would not require entities to account for these rent concessions as lease modifications under certain conditions.
Entities making the election will continue to recognize rental revenue on a straight-line basis for qualifying concessions. Rent deferrals
would result in an increase to accounts receivable during the deferral period with no impact on rental revenue recognition. The Company
elected this policy during the year ended July 31, 2020. Rent deferrals included in receivables were $ 110,000
and $ 250,000
as of January
31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.
Leases - Lessee
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
With the adoption of ASC 842, operating leases are included in operating lease right- of-use assets, and operating lease liabilities on
the Company’s balance sheet.
Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the Company’s
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make payments arising
from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value
of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental
borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s
lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option.
Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Index
Taxes
The computation of the annual expected effective tax rate at each
interim period requires certain estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, the expected operating income for the year and
future periods, projections of the proportion of income (or loss), and permanent and temporary differences. The accounting estimates used
to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, or as additional information is
obtained. To the extent the estimated annual effective tax rate changes during a quarter, the effect of the change on prior quarters is
included in tax expense for the current quarter.
The Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward approximating
$ 10,096,000
as of July 31, 2022 available to offset future taxable income. As of July 31, 2022, the Company had unused state and city
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 12,308,000
for state and $ 12,293,000
for city, available to offset future state and
city taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not used, in 2035.
New York State and New York City taxes are calculated using the higher
of taxes based on income or the respective capital- based franchise taxes. Beginning with the Company’s tax year ended July 31,
2025, changes in the law required the state capital-based tax will be phased out. New York City taxes will be based on capital for the
foreseeable future. Capital-based franchise taxes are recorded to administrative and general expense. State tax amounts in excess of the
capital-based franchise taxes are recorded to income tax expenses. Due to both the application of the capital-based tax and due to the
possible absence of city taxable income, the Company does not record city deferred taxes.
2. Income Per Share of Common Stock:
Income per share has been computed by dividing the net income for
the periods by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods, adjusted for the purchase of treasury
stock. Shares used in computing income per share were
2,015,780
for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
3. Marketable Securities:
The Company’s marketable securities consist of investments
in equity securities. Dividends and interest income are accrued as earned. Realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification
basis. The Company reviews marketable securities for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication
that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. The changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in current period earnings
in accordance with ASC 825.
The Company follows GAAP which establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the valuation techniques and creates the following three broad levels, with Level 1 valuation being the highest priority:
Level 1 valuation inputs
are quoted market prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date (e.g., equity securities traded on the New York
Stock Exchange).
Level 2 valuation inputs
are from other than quoted market
prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (e.g., quoted market prices of
similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active).
Level 3 valuation inputs
are unobservable (e.g., an entity’s
own data) and should be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for
assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at January 31, 2023 and July
31, 2022.
Equity securities
are valued at the closing price reported
on the active market on which the individual securities are traded that the Company has access to.
Mutual funds
are valued at the daily closing price as reported
by the fund. Mutual funds held by the Company are open-end mutual funds that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value (“NAV”) and to transact at that price. The mutual funds held
by the Company are deemed to be actively traded.

4. Financial Instruments and Credit Risk Concentrations:
Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of marketable securities, restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents, and receivables. Marketable securities,
restricted cash, cash, and cash equivalents are placed with multiple financial institutions and instruments to minimize risk. No assurance
can be made that such financial institutions and instruments will minimize all such risk.
Five tenants accounted for approximately
57 % and
69 % of
receivables as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, two
tenants accounted for

Lessee
The Company’s real estate operations include
leased properties under long-term, non-cancelable operating lease agreements. The leases expire at various dates through 2073, including
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. Certain leases provide for
increases in future minimum annual rental payments as defined in the lease agreements.
In July 2022, the Company entered into lease agreements with its
landlord for two of its properties as follows:
(1) Jamaica Avenue at 169th Street, Jamaica, New York - Giving the Company
four five-year option periods to extend its lease beyond the current expiration date of
May 31, 2030
for a total of twenty years through
May 31, 2050. As of January 31, 2023, it is not reasonably certain such options to extend the lease will be exercised by the Company.
(2) 504-506 Fulton Street, Brooklyn, New York – Modification of
the lease agreement to increase monthly lease payments from $ 30,188
per month to $ 34,716

The landlord is Weinstein Enterprises, Inc., an affiliated company
principally owned by the Chairman of the Board of Directors who also principally owns the Company.

Item 2.
J. W. MAYS, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this report. In this
discussion, the words “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to J.W. Mays, Inc., and subsidiaries.
Forward Looking Statements:
The following can be interpreted as including forward looking statements under
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “outlook” “intend”, “plans”, “efforts”,
“anticipates”, “believes”, “expects” or words of similar import typically identify such statements.
Various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements
are identified under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below. Our actual results may
vary significantly from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements based on a number of factors including, but not limited
to, availability of labor, marketing success, competitive conditions, and the change in economic conditions of the various markets we
serve.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates:
Critical accounting policies are defined as those most important to the portrayal
of a company’s financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported
amount of revenues, and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the
critical accounting policies in Note 1 affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable or other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Recently adopted accounting standards are also disclosed in Note 1.
Results of Operations:
Three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended January
31, 2022:
In the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company reported net income
of $44,738, or $.02 per share. In the comparable three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company reported net loss of $(195,830), or
$(.10) per share. The change in the 2023 three months was primarily due to an increase in rental income from several new tenants combined
with increased rents from existing tenants, a decrease in bad debt expense, and increases in the fair value of marketable securities;
partially offset by increases in real estate taxes, building maintenance costs, and state capital-based franchise taxes.
Revenues in the current three months increased to $5,837,819 from $5,328,349
in the comparable 2022 three months primarily due to rental income from several new tenants, and increased rents from existing tenants.
Real estate operating expenses in the current three months increased to $3,958,144
from $3,670,065 in the comparable 2022 three months primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and building maintenance costs.
Administrative and general expenses in the current three months decreased to
$1,406,855 from $1,417,412 in the comparable 2022 three months primarily due to decreases in bad debt expense and legal and professional
fees; partially offset by increases in payroll costs and state capital-based franchise taxes.
Depreciation expense in the current three months decreased to $422,815
from $452,412 in the comparable 2022 three months.
Investment income exceeded interest expense in the current three months
by $9,733. In the comparable 2022 three months period, interest expense exceeded investment income by $(63,290). The improvement in
the 2023 three months was primarily due to increases in the fair value of marketable securities resulting in unrealized gains in the
current period. The prior year comparative period had unrealized losses.
- 15 -
Index
Six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the six months ended January
31, 2022:
In the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company reported net income of
$104,255, or $.05 per share. In the comparable six months ended January 31, 2022, the Company reported net loss of $(586,580), or $(.29)
per share. The change in the 2023 six months was primarily due to an increase in rental income from several new tenants combined with
increased rents from existing tenants, a decrease in bad debt expense, and increases in the fair value of marketable securities; partially
offset by increases in real estate taxes, building maintenance costs, and state capital-based franchise taxes.
Revenues in the current six months increased to $11,607,553 from $10,407,896
in the comparable 2022 six months primarily due to rental income from several new tenants, and increased rents from existing tenants.
Real estate operating expenses in the current six months increased to $7,743,565
from $7,300,187 in the comparable 2022 six months primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and building maintenance costs.
Administrative and general expenses in the current six months decreased to $2,657,086
from $2,821,524 in the comparable 2022 six months primarily due to decreases in bad debt expense and legal and professional fees; partially
offset by increases in payroll costs and state capital-based franchise taxes.
Depreciation expense in the current six months decreased to $841,311
from $903,682 in the comparable 2022 six months.
Interest expense and investment losses in the current year aggregated $(231,336)
compared to $(190,083) in the comparable 2022 six months, primarily due to decreases in dividend and interest income; partially offset
by decreases in unrealized loss on marketable securities and interest expense.

the real estate industry. These include statements regarding our expectations about revenues, our liquidity, our expenses, and our continued
growth, among others. Such forward-looking statements by their nature involve a degree of risk and uncertainty. We caution that a variety
of factors, including but not limited to the factors listed below, could cause business conditions and our results to differ materially
from what is contained in forward-looking statements:
● changes

ability to obtain credit from financial institutions and the related costs;

also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are
generally beyond our control. You should consider the areas of risk described above in connection with any forward-looking statements
that may be made by us.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to review any additional disclosures we
