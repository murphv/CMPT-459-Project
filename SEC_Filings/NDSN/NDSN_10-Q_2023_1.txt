Page 7 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements January 31, 2023 NOTE REGARDING AMOUNTS AND FISCAL YEAR REFERENCES In this quarterly report, all amounts related to United States dollars and foreign currency and to the number of Nordson Corporation’s common shares, except for per share earnings and dividend amounts, are expressed in thousands. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to “we” or the “Company” mean Nordson Corporation. Unless otherwise noted, all references to years relate to our fiscal year ending October 31. Significant accounting policies Basis of presentation .  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and
notes
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022.
Consolidation .  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Nordson Corporation and its 100%-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates and joint ventures in which our ownership is
50 % or less or in which we do not have control but have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.    Use of estimates .  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. Revenue recognition .
A contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and primarily is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. Revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenues deferred as of January 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material. However, for certain contracts related to the sale of customer-specific products within our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment, revenue is recognized over time as we satisfy performance obligations because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The continuous transfer of control to the customer occurs as we enhance assets that are customer controlled and we are contractually entitled to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable margin.   As control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion of the performance obligations. The selection method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We have elected to use the input method – costs incurred for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of products or services to the customer based on incurring costs on the contract. Under this method, revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Contract assets recognized are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and contract liabilities are recorded in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not material on January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. Revenue recognized over time represented approximately less than ten percent of our overall consolidated revenues at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services.  Taxes, including sales and value add, that we collect concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. As a practical expedient, we may exclude the assessment of whether goods or services are performance obligations, if they are immaterial in the context of the contract, and combine these with other performance obligations. While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to treat all shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs as a significant portion of these costs are incurred prior to transfer of control to the customer. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as they are incurred as the amortization period resulting from capitalizing the
Page 8 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation costs is one year or less. These costs are recorded within Selling and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We offer assurance-type warranties on our products as well as separately sold warranty contracts. Revenue related to warranty contracts that are sold separately is recognized over the life of the warranty term and are not material.
Certain arrangements may include installation, installation supervision, training, and spare parts, which tend to be completed in a short period of time, at an insignificant cost, and utilizing skills not unique to us, and, therefore, these items are typically regarded as inconsequential or not material. We disclose disaggregated revenues by operating segment and geography in accordance with the revenue standard and on the same basis used internally by the chief operating decision maker for evaluating performance of operating segments and for allocating resources. Refer to our Operating segments Note for details. Earnings per share .  Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each year, while diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding. Common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon exercise of stock options computed using the treasury stock method, as well as restricted shares and deferred stock-based compensation. Options whose exercise price is higher than the average market price are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be
anti-dilutive. Options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were
144
and
83 , respectively.
Recently issued accounting standards There have been no new accounting standards issued which would require either disclosure or adoption during the current period.
Acquisitions Business acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method, with the acquired assets and liabilities recorded at estimated fair value on the dates of acquisition. The cost in excess of the net assets of the business acquired is included in goodwill. Operating results since the respective dates of acquisitions are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 2023 Acquisition On November 3,
2022 we acquired
100 % of CyberOptics Corporation (CyberOptics). CyberOptics is a leading global developer and manufacturer of high-precision 3D optical sensing technology solutions. The CyberOptics acquisition expanded our test and inspection platform, providing differentiated technology that expands our product offering in the semiconductor and electronics industries and is reported in our Advanced Technology Solutions segment. We acquired CyberOptics for an aggregate purchase price of $ 377,843 , net of cash of approximately $ 40,890 , funded using borrowing under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $ 279,630
and identifiable intangible assets of $ 58,600
were recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $ 15,200
of tradenames (amortized over
fifteen years ), $ 14,600
of technology (amortized over
seven years ), and $ 28,800
of customer contracts (amortized over
twelve years ). T he results of CyberOptics are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of January 31, 2023, t he purchase price allocation remains preliminary as we complete our assessment of intangibles and income taxes.
The assets and liabilities acquired were as follows:   November 3, 2022 Cash $ 40,890   Receivables - net 21,364   Inventories - net 35,300   Goodwill 279,630   Intangibles 58,600   Other assets 14,046   Total Assets $ 449,830     Accounts payable $ 8,109   Deferred income taxes 14,294   Other liabilities 8,694   Total Liabilities $ 31,097   Page 9 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation 2022 Acquisition On November 1, 2021, we acquired
100 % of NDC Technologies (NDC), a leading global provider of precision measurement solutions for in-line manufacturing process control. NDC's technology portfolio includes in-line measurement sensors, gauges and analyzers using near-infrared, laser, X-ray, optical and nucleonic technologies, as well as proprietary algorithms and software. We acquired NDC for an aggregate purchase price of $ 171,613 , net of cash of approximately $ 7,533
and other working capital adjustments of $ 2,763 , utilizing cash on hand. Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $ 131,129
and identifiable intangible assets of $ 31,130
were recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $ 10,800
of tradenames (amortized over
thirteen years ), $ 10,000
of technology (amortized over
seven years ), $ 9,500
of customer relationships (amortized over
four years ) and $ 830
of non-compete agreements (amortized over
three years ). Goodwill associated with this acquisition of $ 72,018
is tax deductible. This acquisition is being reported in our Industrial Precision Solutions segment and the results of NDC are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Receivables Our allowance for credit losses is principally determined based on aging of receivables.
Receivables are exposed to credit risk based on the customers' ability to pay which is influenced by, among other factors, their financial liquidity. We perform ongoing customer credit evaluation to maintain sufficient allowances for potential credit losses. Our segments perform credit evaluation and monitoring to estimate and manage credit risk through the review of customer information, credit ratings, approval and monitoring of customer credit limits, and assessment of market conditions. We may also require prepayments or bank guarantees from customers to mitigate credit risk. Our receivables are generally short-term in nature with a majority of receivables outstanding less than 90 days. Accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance if deemed uncollectible. Accounts receivable are net of an allowance for credit losses of $ 9,148  and $ 8,218  on January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. The provision for losses on receivables was $ 348
and $ 471
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remaining change in the allowance for credit losses is principally related to net write-off/recoveries of uncollectible accounts as well as currency translation. Inventories Components of inventories were as follows:   January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Finished goods $ 256,243   $ 218,491   Raw materials and component parts 191,185   157,447   Work-in-process 57,917   53,195     505,345   429,133   Obsolescence and other reserves ( 57,618 ) ( 45,735 )   $ 447,727   $ 383,398   See Acquisitions Note for inventory increase attributable to acquisition of CyberOptics.

Cumulative translation adjustments Pension and postretirement  benefit plan adjustments Accumulated other  comprehensive income (loss) Balance at October 31, 2022 $ ( 160,046 ) $ ( 47,736 ) $ ( 207,782 ) Pension and other postretirement plan adjustments, net of tax of ($ 195 ) —   ( 576 ) ( 576 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments 76,821   —   76,821   Balance at January 31, 2023 $ ( 83,225 ) $ ( 48,312 ) $ ( 131,537 ) Stock-based compensation During the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved the Nordson Corporation 2021 Stock Incentive and Award Plan (the "2021 Plan") as the successor to the Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive and Award Plan (the "2012 Plan"). The 2021 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, performance shares, cash awards and other stock or performance-based incentives. A maximum of
900
common shares were authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan plus the number of shares that remained available to be granted under the 2012 Plan and additional shares registered related to the acquisition of CyberOptics. As of January 31, 2023, a total of
2,005
common shares were available to be granted under the 2021 Plan. Stock Options Nonqualified or incentive stock options may be granted to our employees and directors. Generally, options granted to employees may be exercised beginning one year from the date of grant at a rate not exceeding
25 % per year and expire
10
years from the date of grant. Vesting accelerates upon a qualified termination in connection with a change in control. In the event of termination of employment due to early retirement or normal retirement at age
65 , options granted within
12
months prior to termination are forfeited, and vesting continues post retirement for all other unvested options granted. In the event of disability or death, all unvested stock options granted within
12
months prior to termination fully vest. Termination for any other reason results in forfeiture of unvested options and vested options in certain circumstances. The amortized cost of options is accelerated if the retirement eligibility date occurs before the normal vesting date. Option exercises are satisfied through the issuance of treasury shares on a first-in, first-out basis. We recognized compensation expense related to stock options of $ 1,663
and $ 1,772
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Page 12 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation The following table summarizes activity related to stock options for the three months ended January 31, 2023:   Number of Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Per Share Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted Average Remaining Term Outstanding at October 31, 2022 1,187 $ 141.82   Granted 78 240.01   Exercised ( 73 ) 122.96   Forfeited or expired ( 2 ) 132.92   Outstanding at January 31, 2023 1,190 $ 148.33   $ 114,851   5.4

years As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 10,669
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options. That cost is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately
1.9
years. The fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 Expected volatility 30.4 % - 31.8 % 30.6 % - 30.8 % Expected dividend yield 1.12 % - 1.12 % 0.76 % - 0.76 % Risk-free interest rate 3.79 % - 3.82 % 1.36 % - 1.47 % Expected life of the option (in years) 5.0 - 6.1 5.3 - 6.2 The weighted-average expected volatility used to value the 2023 and 2022 options was
30.6 % and
30.6 %, respectively. Historical information was the primary basis for the selection of the expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the expected lives of the options. The risk-free interest rate was selected based upon yields of U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option being valued. The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 78.12
and $ 79.03 , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 8,350
and $ 6,961 , respectively.
Cash received from the exercise of stock options for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 8,807
and $ 5,721 , respectively. Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units We may grant restricted shares and/or restricted share units to our employees and directors. These shares or units may not be transferred for a designated period of time (generally
one
to
three years ) defined at the date of grant. We may also grant continuation awards in the form of restricted share units with cliff vesting and a performance measure that must be achieved for the restricted share units to vest.
For employee recipients, in the event of termination of employment due to early retirement, with the consent of the Company, restricted shares and units granted within
12
months prior to termination are forfeited, and other restricted shares and units vest on a pro-rata basis, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee. In the event of termination of employment due to normal retirement at age
65 , restricted shares and units granted within
12
months prior to termination are forfeited, and, for other restricted shares and units, the restriction period applicable to restricted shares will lapse and the shares will vest and be transferable and all unvested units will become vested in full, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee. In the event of a recipient's disability or death, all restricted shares and units granted within
12
months prior to termination fully vest. Termination for any other reason prior to the lapse of any restrictions or vesting of units results in forfeiture of the shares or units. For non-employee directors, all restrictions lapse in the event of disability or death of the non-employee director. Termination of service as a director for any other reason within one year of date of grant results in a pro-rata vesting of shares or units. As shares or units are issued, deferred stock-based compensation equivalent to the fair value on the date of grant is expensed over the vesting period.   Page 13 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation The following table summarizes activity related to restricted shares during the three months ended January 31, 2023:   Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date

and $ 314 , respectively, which included common share dividends of $ 2
and $ 5 , respectively. The following table summarizes activity related to restricted share units during the three months ended January 31, 2023:   Number of Units Weighted-Average Grant Date

of remaining expense to be recognized related to outstanding restricted share units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
2.1
years. The amount charged to expense related to restricted share units during each of the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 2,258
and $ 2,273 . Performance Share Incentive Awards
Executive officers and selected other key employees are eligible to receive common share-based incentive awards. Payouts, in the form of unrestricted common shares, vary based on the degree to which corporate financial performance exceeds predetermined threshold, target and maximum performance goals over
three-year
performance periods. No payout will occur unless threshold performance is achieved. The amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered. The calculations are based upon the grant date fair value, which is principally driven by the stock price on the date of grant or a Monte Carlo valuation for awards with market conditions. The per share values were $ 231.34
in 2023, and $ 260.60 , $ 273.50 , and $ 221.94
for 2022. The amount charged to expense related to performance awards for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 2,062
and $ 3,944 , respectively. The cumulative amount recorded in shareholders' equity at January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 10,603
and $ 10,959 , respectively. As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 12,980
of unrecognized compensation cost related to performance share incentive awards. Deferred Compensation
Our executive officers and other highly compensated employees may elect to defer up to
100 % of their base pay and cash incentive compensation, and for executive officers, up to
90 % of their share-based performance incentive payout each year. Additional share units are credited for quarterly dividends paid on our common shares. Expense related to dividends paid under this plan for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 18
and $ 18 , respectively. Deferred Directors' Compensation Non-employee directors may defer all or part of their cash and equity-based compensation until retirement. Cash compensation may be deferred as cash or as share equivalent units. Deferred cash amounts are recorded as liabilities, and share equivalent units are recorded as equity. Additional share equivalent units are earned when common share dividends are declared.

Warranties We offer warranties to our customers depending on the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement.  A typical warranty program requires that we repair or replace defective products within a specified time period (generally
one year ) from the date of delivery or first use. We record an estimate for future warranty-related costs based on actual historical return rates.  Based on analysis of return rates and other factors, the adequacy of our warranty provisions are adjusted as necessary. The liability for warranty costs is included in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Following is a reconciliation of the product warranty liability for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022:   January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 Beginning balance at October 31 $ 11,723   $ 11,113   Accruals for warranties 4,809   3,865   Warranty payments ( 3,186 ) ( 3,051 ) Currency effect 215   ( 10 ) Ending balance $ 13,561   $ 11,917   Operating segments We conduct business in
three
p rimary operating segments: Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and Advanced Technology Solutions. The composition of segments and measure of segment profitability is consistent with that used by our chief operating decision maker. The primary measure used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing performance is operating profit, which equals sales less cost of sales and certain operating expenses. Items below the operating profit line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (interest and investment income, interest expense and other income/expense) are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our chief operating decision maker and are not presented by operating segment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Significant accounting policies Note. Industrial Precision Solutions:
This segment focuses on delivering proprietary dispensing and processing technology, both standard and highly customized equipment, to diverse end markets. Product lines commonly reduce material consumption, increase line efficiency through precision dispense and measurement and control, and enhance product brand and appearance. Components are used for dispensing adhesives, coatings, paint, finishes, sealants and other materials. This segment primarily serves the industrial, consumer durables and non-durables markets. Medical and Fluid Solutions:
This segment includes the Company’s fluid management solutions for medical, high-tech industrial and other diverse end markets. Related plastic tubing, balloons, catheters, syringes, cartridges, tips and fluid connection components are used to dispense or control fluids within customers’ medical devices or products, as well as production processes. Advanced Technology Solutions:
This segment focuses on products serving electronics end markets.
Advanced Technology Solutions products integrate our proprietary product technologies found in progressive stages of an electronics customer’s production processes, such as surface treatment, precisely controlled dispensing of material and test and inspection to ensure quality and reliability. Applications include, but are not limited to, semiconductors, printed circuit boards, electronic components and automotive electronics.

Foreign exchange contracts are valued using market exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges.
Page 16 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation (b) Executive officers and other highly compensated employees may defer up to
100 % of their salary and annual cash incentive compensation and for executive officers, up to
90 % of their long-term incentive compensation, into various non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Deferrals can be allocated to various market performance measurement funds. Changes in the value of compensation deferred under these plans are recognized each period based on the fair value of the underlying measurement funds. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments, other than cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable, are shown in the table below.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.   January 31, 2023   Carrying Amount Fair Value Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 1,016,113   $ 1,003,337   Long-term debt is valued by discounting future cash flows at currently available rates for borrowing arrangements with similar terms and conditions, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount of long-term debt is shown net of unamortized debt issuance costs as disclosed in the Long-term Debt Note. Derivative financial instruments   We operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currency transactions occur and the dates they are settled. We regularly use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts usually have maturities of
90
days or less and generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars at maturity, at rates stated in the contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in each accounting period in “Other – net” on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income together with the transaction gain or loss from the related balance sheet position.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, we recognized a net gain of $ 16,139
on foreign currency forward contracts and a net loss of $ 20,710
from the change in fair value of balance sheet positions. For the three months ended January 31, 2022, we recognized a net loss of $ 3,598
on foreign currency forward contracts and a net gain of $ 3,962
from the change in fair value of balance sheet positions. The fair values of our foreign currency forward contract assets and liabilities are included in Receivable-net and Accrued liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Euro loan, due 2023
— In March 2020, we amended, restated and extended the term of our existing euro term loan facility with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited. The interest rate is variable based on the EURIBOR rate. The term loan agreement provides for the following term loans due in two tranches: € 115,000
is due in March 2023 and an additional
€ 150,000
that was drawn down in March 2020 is due in March 2023. The weighted average interest rate at January 31, 2023 was
2.12 %.
Term loan, due 2024
— In January 2023, we entered into a $ 200,000
unsecured term loan facility. This facility has a
1.25
year term and expires in April 2024. At January 31, 2023, we had no balance outstanding under this facility. We were in compliance with all covenants at January 31, 2023 and the amount we could borrow would not have been limited by any debt covenants.
Contingencies We are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental, product liability, patent, contract, employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business.   Including the environmental matters discussed below, after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows. Environmental We have voluntarily agreed with the City of New Richmond, Wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the City of New Richmond municipal landfill (the "Site") and the construction of a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the Site. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, our accrual for the ongoing operation, maintenance and monitoring obligation at th e Site was $ 266
a nd $ 266 , respectively. The liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations. The accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities, the
Page 18 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations, and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements. Consequently, our liability could be greater than our current estimate. However, we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Page 19 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Overview Nordson Corporation is an innovative precision technology company that leverages a scalable growth framework to deliver top tier growth with leading margins and returns. The Company’s direct sales model and applications expertise serves global customers through a wide variety of critical applications. Its diverse end market exposure includes consumer non-durable, medical, electronics and industrial end markets.
Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Westlake, Ohio, the Company has approximately 7,200 employees with operations and support offices in over 35 countries. COVID-19 Update In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged and has since spread to other countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (the COVID-19 pandemic). The COVID-19 pandemic, including multiple variants, has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business interruptions and other measures.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have supported, and continue to support, multiple “critical infrastructure” sectors by manufacturing materials and products needed for medical supply chains, packaging, transportation, energy, communications, and other critical infrastructure industries. We have benefited from our geographical and product diversification as the end markets we serve have remained resilient in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to invest in the businesses, people, and strategies necessary to achieve our long-term priorities as we focus on driving profitable growth. We have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic in all our production facilities, having taken the recommended public health measures to ensure worker and workplace safety. As a result, there have been unfavorable impacts on our manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, we are taking steps to offset cost increases from COVID-19 pandemic-related supply chain disruptions.
We continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving circumstances and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has negatively disrupted, and may continue to negatively disrupt, our business and results of operations in the future. For example, in the first quarter of 2023, our revenue growth in Asia-Pacific was negatively impacted by labor shortages and business disruption from the spread of COVID-19. The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the markets we serve remains highly uncertain and will depend largely on future developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including infection rates increasing or returning in various geographic areas, variations of COVID-19, the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as reimposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions, and the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine, among other things. These developments are constantly evolving and cannot be accurately predicted.
CyberOptics Acquisition On November 3, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of CyberOptics Corporation (“CyberOptics”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 7, 2022, by and among the Company, Meta Merger Company and CyberOptics. CyberOptics is
a leading global developer and manufacturer of high-precision 3D optical sensing technology solutions. The CyberOptics acquisition expanded our test and inspection platform, providing differentiated technology that expands our product offering in the semiconductor and electronics industries and will be reported in our Advanced Technology Solutions segment. The all-cash transaction of approximately $378,000, net of cash acquired, was funded using borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand and is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates A comprehensive discussion of the Company’s critical accounting policies and management estimates and significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022 (the 2022 Form 10-K). There have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies, management estimates or accounting policies followed since the year ended October 31, 2022. Page 20 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation Results of Operations Three months ended January 31, 2023 Worldwide sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $610,477, an increase of 0.2% from sales of $609,166 for the comparable period of 2022. The increase consisted of a 1.4% increase in organic sales and a favorable 2.8% increase due to an acquisition, which was partially offset by an unfavorable effect from currency translation of 4.0%. The organic sales increase was driven by strong demand in Europe and the Americas region, partially offset by weakness in the Asia Pacific region, predominantly in China. In the Americas region, sales were $264,878 for the three months ended January 31, 2023, an increase of 10.4% from 2022, consisting of an organic sales increase of 8.6% and an increase due to an acquisition of 2.1%, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 0.3%. In the Asia Pacific region, sales were $182,660, a decrease of 14.4% from 2022, consisting of an organic sales decrease of 13.3% and a 5.8% decrease due to unfavorable currency effects, partially offset by a 4.7% increase due to an acquisition. In Europe, sales were $162,939, an increase of 4.5% from 2022, consisting of an organic sales increase of 10.7% and a 1.3% increase due to an acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 7.5%.
Cost of sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $281,610, up from $269,032 in the comparable period of 2022. Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of sales, decreased to 53.9% from 55.8% in the comparable period of 2022. The 1.9 percentage point decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the impact of passing through inflationary cost increases and incremental inventory step-up amortization of $2,743. Selling and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were $184,648, up from $184,274 in the comparable period of 2022. The 0.2% increase was primarily driven by the first-year effect of an acquisition, partially offset by favorable currency translation effects and a reduction in variable expenses. Operating profit decreased to $144,219
for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to
$155,860 in
the
comparable period of
2022. Operating profit
as a percentage of sales decreased to 23.6% f or the three months ended January 31, 2023
compared to 25.6%
in the comparable period of 2022 . The 2.0 percentage point decline in operating margin was primarily driven by fees, severance and non-cash inventory charges associated with the CyberOptics acquisition, as well as unfavorable currency translation effects. Interest expense for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $10,530, compared to $5,650 in the comparable period of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt levels compared to the prior year period, as well as increases in interest rates. Other expense was $3,196 compared to other income of $1,292 in the comparable period of 2022. Included in 2023 other expense were pension and postretirement income of $1,369 and $4,571 of foreign currency losses. Included in 2022 other income were pension and postretirement income of $281 and $364 of foreign currency gains. Net income for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $104,261, or $1.81 per diluted share, compared to $120,409, or $2.05 per diluted share, in the same period of 2022. This represents a 13.4% decrease in net income, and a 11.7% decrease in diluted earnings per share. The decrease was driven by a combination of fees, severance, and non-cash inventory charges associated with the CyberOptics acquisition, increased interest expense, and foreign currency losses.
Industrial Precision Solutions Sales of the Industrial Precision Solutions segment were $311,546 in the three months ended January 31, 2023, a decrease of 3.8% from sales in the comparable period of 2022 of $323,933. The decrease consisted of an organic sales increase of 1.2%, which was offset by unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 5.0%. The organic sales increase was driven primarily by steady demand across most product lines and regions, offset by softness in the Asia Pacific region due to labor shortages and business disruption from the spread of COVID-19, as well as the timing of the Chinese New Year. Operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 32.8% for
the three months ended January 31, 2023
compared to 31.5% in the comparable period of
2022 .
The 1.3 percentage point improvement in operating margin was primarily due to favorable product mix. Medical and Fluid Solutions Sales of the Medical and Fluid Solutions segment were $154,287 in the three months ended January 31, 2023, a decrease of 2.8% from sales in the comparable period of 2022 of $158,784. The decrease consisted of an organic sales decrease of 0.8% and unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 2.0%. The organic sales decrease was driven by lower demand for the medical fluid components product lines and fluid solutions product lines in China, offset by strong demand for medical interventional solutions product lines.
Page 21 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation Operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 25.5% for
the three months ended January 31, 2023
compared to 30.9% in the comparable period of
2022 . T he 5.4 percentage point decline in operating margin was primarily due to meaningful sales mix changes within medical product lines and related factory inefficiencies due to reduced volumes. Advanced Technology Solutions Sales of the Advanced Technology Solutions segment were $144,644 in the three months ended January 31, 2023, an increase of 14.4% from sales in the comparable period of 2022 of $126,449. The increase was the result of organic sales increase of 4.6% and a 13.5% increase due to an acquisition, partially offset by an unfavorable currency effect of 3.7%. The organic sales increase was driven by test and inspection product lines. Operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 11.7% for
the three months ended January 31, 2023
compared to 21.5% in the comparable period of
2022 . T he 9.8 percentage point decline in operating margin was primarily due to
fees, severance and non-cash inventory charges of $10,295 associated with the CyberOptics acquisition and unfavorable sales mix. Income taxes We record our interim provision for income taxes based on our estimated annual effective tax rate, as well as certain items discrete to the current period. Significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. We have considered several factors in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets which include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. We review our tax positions on a regular basis and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. The effective tax rate for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was 20.5%, compared to 20.8% for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Foreign Currency Effects In the aggregate, average exchange rates for 2023 used to translate international sales and operating results into U.S. dollars were generally unfavorable compared with average exchange rates existing during 2022. It is not possible to precisely measure the impact on operating results arising from foreign currency exchange rate changes, because of changes in selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structure in each country in which we operate. However, if transactions for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were translated at exchange rates in effect during the same period of 2022, we estimated that sales would have been approximately $24,800 higher while costs of sales and selling and administrative expenses would have been approximately $16,600 higher. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources During the three months ended January 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents decreased $41,463 as cash was used to fund the
CyberOptics
acquisition, partially offset by incremental borrowings and cash generated from operations in the period. Cash provided by operations during this period was $123,337 compared to $118,087 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash by $58,371 in the three months ended January 31, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, compared to decreasing cash by $29,217 in the comparable period of 2022. Other improved year over year due primarily to cash inflows related to settlement of foreign exchange contracts. Cash used in investing activities was $387,136 for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $184,097 used in the comparable period of 2022. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, cash of $377,843 was used for the CyberOptics acquisition and cash of $9,302 was used for capital expenditures. During the
three
months ended January 31, 2022, cash of $171,613 was used for the NDC acquisition and $12,491 was used for capital expenditures. The decrease in capital expenditures related primarily to 2022 expenditures being higher as a result of capacity expansion in our medical fluid dispensing and components product lines. Cash provided by financing activities was $215,693 for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $61,902 cash used in the comparable period of 2022. In the three months ended January 31, 2023, cash of $37,199 was used for dividend payments and cash of $6,875 was used for the purchase of treasury shares, compared to $29,724 and $35,002, respectively, in the comparable period of 2022. The three months ended January 31, 2023 included net borrowings of long-term debt of $252,278, used primarily to fund the acquisition of CyberOptics, compared to net repayments of
$1,257 during the three months ended
January 31, 2022 .
The following is a summary of significant changes in balance sheet captions from October 31, 2022 to January 31, 2023. Inventories-net increased by $64,329, primarily as a result of the CyberOptics acquisition. Goodwill and intangibles increased by $279,630 and $58,600, respectively, due to the CyberOptics acquisition. Accrued liabilities decreased by $49,964 due primarily to incentive compensation payments made in the
three months ended January 31, 2023, and long-term debt
increased principally as result of borrowing $250,000 under the revolving credit facility for the CyberOptics acquisition. Page 22 Table of Contents Nordson Corporation We believe the combination of present capital resources, cash from operations and unused financing sources, such as our credit facilities, which includes our revolving credit facility and new term loan entered in January 2023, are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. There are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent Company. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2023.
