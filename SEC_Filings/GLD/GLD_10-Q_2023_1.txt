Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements
1.
Organization
The SPDR® Gold Trust (the “Trust”) is an investment trust formed on
November 12, 2004
under New York law pursuant to a trust indenture (the “Trust Indenture”). The fiscal year-end for the Trust is
September 30 th . The Trust holds gold and is expected from time to time to issue shares (“Shares”) (in minimum denominations of
100,000
Shares, also referred to as “Baskets”) in exchange for deposits of gold and to distribute gold in connection with the redemption of Baskets. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the Trust’s expenses. World Gold Trust Services, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust (the “Sponsor”). BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon, is the trustee of the Trust (the “Trustee”). State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC is the marketing agent of the Trust (the “Marketing Agent”). HSBC Bank plc ("HSBC") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are the custodians of the Trust (each a "Custodian" and together, the “Custodians”).
The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “NYSE Arca”) under the symbol “GLD”, providing investors with an efficient means to obtain market exposure to the price of gold bullion. The Shares are also listed on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), the Singapore Exchange Limited and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The Trustee does
not
actively manage the gold held by the Trust. This means that the Trustee does
not
sell gold at times when its price is high or acquire gold at low prices in the expectation of future price increases. It also means that the Trustee does
not
make use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional gold investors to attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from price decreases. Any losses sustained by the Trust will adversely affect the value of the Shares.
The Statements of Financial Condition and Schedules of Investment at
December 31, 2022  and the Statements of Operations, Cash Flows and Changes in Net Assets for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021
have been prepared on behalf of the Trust without audit. In the opinion of management of the Sponsor of the Trust, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the  three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and for all periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2022 . The results of operations for the  three
months ended
December 31, 2022
are
not
necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year.
2.
Significant Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires those responsible for preparing financial statements to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.
2.1.
Basis of Accounting
For accounting purposes only, the Trust is an investment company and, therefore, applies the specialized accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic
946,
Financial Services—Investment Companies. The Trust is
not
registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940,
as amended.
2.2.
Fair Value Measurement
FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic
820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, provides a single definition of fair value, a hierarchy for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value adjustments.
The Trust does
not
hold any derivative instruments, and its assets only consist of allocated gold bullion and, from time to time, (i) gold receivable, representing gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of Shares where the gold has
not
yet been transferred to the Trust’s account and (ii) cash, which is used to pay expenses.
U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price the Trust would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Trust’s policy is to value its investments at fair value.
6
Table of Contents
Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities. Inputs
may
be based on independent market data (“observable inputs”) or they
may
be internally developed (“unobservable inputs”). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of
three
broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The
three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level  1
– Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level  2
– Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level  1
that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not
considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means; and
Level  3
– Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, including the Trust’s assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments.
The following table summarizes the Trust’s investments at fair value:

There were

and other Levels for the

months ended
December 31, 2022 , or for the year ended
September 30, 2022 .
The Trustee values the gold held by the Trust on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold as determined by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), a benchmark administrator, which provides an independently administered auction process as well as the overall administration and governance for the London Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”). In determining the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Trust, the Trustee values the gold held by the Trust on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the IBA
3:00
PM auction process (“LBMA Gold Price PM”), which is an electronic auction, with the imbalance calculated, and the price adjusted in rounds ( 30
seconds in duration). The auction runs twice daily at
10:30
AM and
3:00
PM London time. The Trustee determines the NAV of the Trust on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier of the LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or
12:00
PM New York time. If
no
LBMA Gold Price is made on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price has
not
been announced by
12:00
PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the NAV of the Trust, unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such a price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination.
2.3.
Custody of Gold
Gold is held by the Custodians on behalf of the Trust,
100 % of which is allocated gold in the form of good delivery gold bars. A current list of all gold held by each Custodian, including any held with a subcustodian is available on the sponsor’s website at www.spdrgoldshares.com.

Table of Contents
2.4.
Gold Receivable
Gold receivable represents the quantity of gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of Shares where the gold has
not
yet been transferred to the Trust’s account. Generally, ownership of the gold is transferred within
two
business days of the trade date.

Creations and Redemptions of Shares
The Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in
one
or more Baskets (a Basket equals a block of
100,000
Shares). The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to certain authorized participants (“Authorized Participants”) on an ongoing basis. The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold and any cash represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the combined net asset value of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received.
As the Shares of the Trust are redeemable in Baskets at the option of the Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the Shares as Net Assets for financial reporting purposes.

2.7.
Income and Expense (Amounts in
000 ’ s of US$)
The Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust’s gold as necessary to pay the Trust’s expenses. When selling gold to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor to sell the smallest amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trust’s holdings of assets other than gold. Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will sell gold to the Custodians at the next LBMA Gold Price PM following the sale order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the average cost of the gold sold, and such amounts are reported as net realized gain/(loss) from investment in gold sold to pay expenses on the Statements of Operations.
The Trust’s net realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
of $ 4,082,272
is made up of a realized gain of $ 2,693   from the sale of gold to pay expenses, a realized gain of $ 175,717
from gold distributed for the redemption of Shares, and a change in unrealized gain of $ 3,903,862
on investment in gold.

from the sale of gold to pay expenses, a realized gain of $ 302,742
from gold distributed for the redemption of Shares, and a change in unrealized gain of $ 2,093,694
on investment in gold.
2.8.
Income Taxes
The Trust is classified as a “grantor trust” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will
not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the Trust’s income and expenses will “flow through” to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trust’s proceeds, income, deductions, gains, and losses to the Internal Revenue Service on that basis. The Sponsor of the Trust has evaluated whether or
not
there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that
no
reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of

The Sponsor evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of its tax treatment, and its tax reporting to its shareholders, of these positions to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than- not”
to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions
not
deemed to meet that threshold would be recorded as an expense in the current year. The Trust is required to analyze all open tax years. Open tax years are those years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority.
As of December 31, 2022, the 2021, 2020 and 2019 tax years remain open for examination. There were
no
examinations in progress at period end.

Sponsor
and Trustee
The Trust’s only recurring fixed expense is the Sponsor’s fee which accrues daily at an annual rate equal to
0.40 % of the daily NAV, in exchange for the Sponsor assuming the responsibility to pay all ordinary fees and expenses of the Trust which include fees and expenses of the Trustee, the fees and expenses of the Custodians for the custody of the Trust’s gold bars, the fees and expenses of the Sponsor, certain taxes, the fees of the Marketing Agent, printing and mailing costs, legal and audit fees, registration fees, NYSE Arca listing fees and other marketing costs and expenses.
Affiliates of the Trustee
may
from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.
4.
Concentration of Risk
The Trust’s sole business activity is the investment of gold. Various factors could affect the price of gold including: (i) global supply and demand, which is influenced by such factors as gold’s uses in jewelry, technology and industrial applications, purchases made by investors in the form of bars, coins and other gold products, forward selling by gold producers, purchases made by gold producers to unwind gold hedge positions, central bank purchases and sales, and production and cost levels in major gold-producing countries such as China, Australia, and the United States; (ii) investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; (iii) currency exchange rates; (iv) interest rates; (v) investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; (vi) other economic variables such as income growth, economic output, and monetary policies; and (vii) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations, especially those that are unexpected in nature. In addition, while gold is used to preserve wealth by investors around the world, there is
no
assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of gold declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately. Each of these events could have a material effect on the Trust’s financial position and results of operations.
5.
Indemnification
The Sponsor, and its shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, affiliates and subsidiaries, are indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against certain losses, liabilities or expenses incurred in the performance of their duties under the Trust Indenture without gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, willful malfeasance or reckless disregard of the indemnified party’s obligations and duties under the Trust Indenture. Such indemnity includes payment by the Trust of the costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim or liability under the Trust Indenture. Under the Trust Indenture, the Sponsor
may
be able to seek indemnification by the Trust for payments it makes in connection with the Sponsor’s activities under the Trust Indenture to the extent its conduct does
not
disqualify it from receiving such indemnification under the terms of the Trust Indenture. The Sponsor is also indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense arising under the Amended and Restated Marketing Agent Agreement between the Sponsor and the Marketing Agent effective
July  17,
2015,
as amended, or any agreement entered into with an Authorized Participant which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of gold and any cash required for creations and redemptions insofar as such loss, liability or expense arises from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any written statement provided to the Sponsor by the Trustee. Any amounts payable to the Sponsor are secured by a lien on the Trust’s assets.

The Sponsor has agreed to indemnify certain parties against certain liabilities and to contribute to payments that such parties
may
be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse such parties, solely from and to the extent of the Trust’s assets, for indemnification and contribution amounts due from the Sponsor in respect of such liabilities to the extent the Sponsor has
not
paid such amounts when due. The Sponsor has agreed that, to the extent the Trustee pays any amount in respect of the reimbursement obligations described in the preceding sentence, the Trustee, for the benefit of the Trust, will be subrogated to and will succeed to the rights of the party so reimbursed against the Sponsor.

Trust Overview
SPDR ®
Gold Trust (the “Trust”) is an investment trust that was formed on November 12, 2004 (the “Date of Inception”). The Trust issues baskets of Shares (“Baskets”) in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with the redemption of Baskets. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost effective and convenient way to invest in gold.
Gold is held by HSBC Bank plc ("HSBC") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (each a "Custodian" and together, the “Custodians”) on behalf of the Trust.
As of the date of this quarterly report, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas LLC are the only Authorized Participants. An updated list of Authorized Participants can be obtained from the Trustee or the Sponsor.
Investing in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The following chart illustrates the movement in the price of the Shares and NAV of the Shares against the corresponding gold price (per 1/10 of an oz. of gold) since the day the Shares first began trading on the NYSE and subsequent transfer to NYSE Arca:
Share price   & NAV v. gold price
–
November   18, 2004 to December 31, 2022
The divergence of the price of the Shares and NAV of the Shares from the gold price over time reflects the cumulative effect of the Trust expenses that arise if an investment had been held since inception.
Critical Accounting Policy
Valuation of Gold, Definition of NAV
The Trustee values the gold held by the Trust and determines the NAV of the Trust as of the LBMA Gold Price PM on each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier of the LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price PM is announced on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the NAV of the Trust, unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. In the event the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that such price is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the Trust’s gold, they will identify an alternative basis for such valuation to be employed by the Trustee. While we believe that the LBMA Gold Price is an appropriate indicator of the value of gold, there are other indicators that are available that could be different than the LBMA Gold Price. The use of such an alternative indicator could result in materially different fair value pricing of the gold in the Trust which could result in different market adjustments or redemption value adjustments of our outstanding redeemable Shares.
Once the value of the gold has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust’s reserve account, if established). The resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on NYSE Arca.

Table of Contents
Inspectorate International Limited (“Inspectorate”) conducts two counts each year of the gold bullion held on behalf of the Trust at the vaults of the Custodians. A complete bar count is conducted once per year and coincides with the Trust’s financial year end at September 30 th . On October 3, 2022, Inspectorate concluded the annual full count of the Trust’s gold bullion held by HSBC. The second count is a random sample count and is conducted at a date which falls within the same financial year and was conducted most recently at HSBC's vault on April 29, 2022. The results can be found on
www.spdrgoldshares.com . The Sponsor generally visits the vaults of the Custodians twice a year as part of its due diligence procedures.
Recent Developments
The Trust as well as the Sponsor and its service providers are vulnerable to the effects of geopolitical events and the continuation of the war in Ukraine or other hostilities. Geopolitical events and the continuation of the hostilities in Ukraine or other hostilities could disrupt and potentially impact the business activities of the Sponsor and its service providers and have an adverse effect on the Trust.
In late February 2022, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, significantly amplifying already existing geopolitical tensions among Russia and other countries in the region and in the west. On March 7, 2022, the LBMA suspended its accreditation of six Russian precious metals refiners. The LBMA stated that existing bars produced by the refiners before their suspension will still be accepted as good delivery. Following an announcement at the G7 Summit to collectively ban the import of Russian gold, the UK passed regulations which prohibit the direct or indirect (i) import of gold that originated in Russia, (ii) acquisition of gold that originated in Russia or is located in Russia and (iii) supply or delivery of gold that originated in Russia, all after July 21, 2022. Similarly, US regulations prohibit the import of gold of Russian origin into the United States on or after June 28, 2022 and EU regulations prohibit the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of gold if it originates in Russia and has been exported from Russia after July 22, 2022.
The responses of countries and political bodies to Russia’s actions, the larger overarching tensions, and Ukraine’s military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility generally, have adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in the price of gold and the price of the Shares. In addition, the conflict in Ukraine, along with global political fallout and implications including sanctions, shipping disruptions, collateral war damage, and a potential expansion of the conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders, could disturb the gold market.
War and other geopolitical events in eastern Europe, including but not limited to Russia and Ukraine, may cause volatility in commodity prices including precious metals prices. These events are unpredictable and may lead to extended periods of price volatility. To date, the impact of the conflict in Ukraine, including the regulatory responses to such conflict, have not materially affected the operations of the Trust and have not materially impacted the price of gold or the share price of the Trust.
Results of Operations
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, an additional 17,800,000 Shares (178 Baskets) were created in exchange for 1,656,782.2 ounces of gold, 25,100,000 Shares (251 Baskets) were redeemed in exchange for 2,336,597.9 ounces of gold, and 29,515.0 ounces of gold were sold to pay expenses.
At December 31, 2022, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by the Custodians was 29,530,952 ounces, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of $53,520,421,006 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on December 31, 2022 (cost— $48,197,729,420 ).
At September 30, 2022, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by the Custodians was 30,323,468 ounces, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of $50,693,257,111 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2022 (cost— $49,274,427,022).
Cash Resources and Liquidity
At December 31, 2022, the Trust did not have any cash balances. When selling gold to pay expenses, the Trustee endeavors to sell the exact amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trust’s holdings of assets other than gold. As a consequence, we expect that the Trust will not record any net cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period.

Movements in the Price of Gold
As movements in the price of gold are expected to directly affect the price of the Trust’s Shares, investors should understand what the recent movements in the price of gold have been. Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in the gold price are not indicators of future movements.
The following chart provides historical background on the price of gold. The chart illustrates movements in the price of gold in US dollars per ounce over the period from November 12, 2004 to December 31, 2022 and is based on the LBMA Gold Price PM when available.
