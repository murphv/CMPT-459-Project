AETHLON MEDICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
December 31, 2022
1.
NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION ORGANIZATION
Aethlon Medical, Inc., or Aethlon, the Company,
we or us, is a medical therapeutic company focused on developing products to diagnose and treat cancer and life-threatening infectious
diseases. The Aethlon Hemopurifier is a clinical-stage immunotherapeutic device designed to combat cancer and life-threatening viral infections.
In cancer, the Hemopurifier is designed to deplete the presence of circulating tumor-derived exosomes that promote immune suppression,
seed the spread of metastasis and inhibit the benefit of leading cancer therapies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has
designated the Hemopurifier as a “Breakthrough Device” for two independent indications:
·
the treatment of individuals with advanced or metastatic cancer who are either unresponsive to or intolerant of standard of care therapy, and with cancer types in which exosomes have been shown to participate in the development or severity of the disease; and
·
the treatment of life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies.
We believe the Hemopurifier can be a substantial
advance in the treatment of patients with advanced and metastatic cancer through the clearance of exosomes that promote the growth and
spread of tumors through multiple mechanisms. We are currently working with our new contract research organization, or CRO, on preparations
to conduct a clinical trial in Australia in patients with solid tumors, including head and neck cancer, gastrointestinal cancers and
other cancers.
On October 4, 2019, the FDA approved our Investigational
Device Exemption, or IDE, application to initiate an Early Feasibility Study, or EFS, of the Hemopurifier in patients with head and neck
cancer in combination with standard of care pembrolizumab (Keytruda). The primary endpoint for the EFS, designed to enroll 10 to 12 subjects
at a single center, is safety, with secondary endpoints including measures of exosome clearance and characterization, as well as response
and survival rates. This clinical trial, initially conducted at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in Pittsburgh, PA, or UPMC, treated two
patients. Due to lack of further patient enrollment, we and UPMC terminated this trial. We
are in the process of designing other clinical
trials in oncology, to include additional solid tumors. These trials initially are planned to be conducted in Australia.
We also believe the Hemopurifier can be part of
the broad-spectrum treatment of life-threatening highly glycosylated, or carbohydrate coated, viruses that are not addressed with an already
approved treatment. In small-scale or early feasibility human studies, the Hemopurifier has been used in the past to treat individuals
infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, hepatitis-C and Ebola.
Additionally,
in vitro,
the Hemopurifier
has been demonstrated to capture Zika virus, Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya
virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, smallpox-related viruses, H1N1 swine flu virus, H5N1 bird flu virus, Monkeypox virus and the reconstructed
Spanish flu virus of 1918. In several cases, these studies were conducted in collaboration with leading government or non-government research
institutes.
On June 17, 2020, the FDA approved a supplement
to our open IDE for the Hemopurifier in viral disease to allow for the testing of the Hemopurifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19,
or COVID-19, in a New Feasibility Study.
That study was designed to enroll up to 40 subjects at
up to 20 centers in the United States. Subjects will have established laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, be admitted to an intensive care
unit, or ICU, and will have acute lung injury and/or severe or life-threatening disease, among other criteria. Endpoints for this study,
in addition to safety, included reduction in circulating virus as well as clinical outcomes (NCT # 04595903).
In June 2022, the
first patient in this study was enrolled and completed the Hemopurifier treatment phase of the protocol.
Under
Single Patient Emergency Use regulations, the Company has
treated two patients with COVID-19 with the Hemopurifier.
7
We currently are experiencing a disruption in
our Hemopurifier supply, as our existing supply of Hemopurifiers expired on September 30, 2022 and, as previously disclosed, we are dependent
on FDA approval of qualified suppliers to manufacture our Hemopurifier. Our intended transition to a new supplier for Galanthus nivalis
agglutinin, or GNA, is delayed as we work with the FDA for approval of our supplement to our IDE, which is required to make this manufacturing
change.
In October 2022, we launched a wholly owned subsidiary
in Australia, formed to conduct clinical research, seek regulatory approval and commercialize our Hemopurifier in that country. The subsidiary
will initially focus on the oncology market in Australia. There were only insignificant expenses in that subsidiary in the three months
ended December 31, 2022.
We also obtained ethics review board approval
and entered into a clinical trial agreement with Medanta Medicity Hospital, a multi-specialty hospital in Delhi NCR, India, for a COVID-19
clinical trial at that location. One patient has completed participation in the Indian COVID-19 study. The relevant authorities in India
have accepted the use of the Hemopurifiers made with the GNA from our new supplier.
Previously, we were the majority owner of Exosome
Sciences, Inc., or ESI, a company formed to focus on the discovery of exosomal biomarkers to diagnose and monitor life-threatening diseases,
and thus consolidated ESI in our consolidated financial statements. For more than four years, the primary activities of ESI were limited
to the payment of patent maintenance fees and applications. In September 2022, the Board of Directors of ESI and the Company, as the majority
stockholder of ESI, approved the dissolution of ESI. Accordingly, ESI is eliminated from our December 31, 2022 balance sheet.
Successful outcomes of human trials will also
be required by the regulatory agencies of certain foreign countries where we plan to sell the Hemopurifier. Some of our patents may expire
before FDA approval or approval in a foreign country, if any, is obtained. However, we believe that certain patent applications and/or
other patents issued more recently will help protect the proprietary nature of the Hemopurifier treatment technology.
In addition to the foregoing, we are monitoring
closely the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, inflation and the war in Ukraine on our business. Given the level of uncertainty regarding
the duration and impact of these events on capital markets and the U.S. economy, we are unable to assess the impact on our timelines and
future access to capital. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and the war in Ukraine will impact our business, results
of operations, financial condition, clinical trials and preclinical research will depend on future developments, as well as the economic
impact on national and international markets that are highly uncertain.
Our executive offices are located at 11555 Sorrento
Valley Road, Suite 203, San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is (619) 941-0360. Our website address is www.aethlonmedical.com.
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol
“AEMD.”
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
there were no changes to our significant accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2022.
8
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC,
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2022, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 28, 2022. The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aethlon Medical, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Aethlon
Medical Australia Pty Ltd, as well as its previously majority-owned subsidiary, ESI, which dissolved in September 2022. All significant
inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the condensed
consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and the condensed consolidated statement of cash
flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Estimates were made relating to useful lives of fixed assets, impairment of assets,
share-based compensation expense and accruals for clinical trial and research and development expenses. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated
balance sheet at March 31, 2022, contained in the above referenced 10-K. The results of operations for the nine months ended December
31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year balances within the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN
Management expects existing cash as of December
31, 2022 to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these condensed
consolidated financial statements.
Restricted Cash
To comply with the terms of our laboratory and
office lease and our lease for our manufacturing space, see Note 11, we caused our bank to issue two standby letters of credit, or L/Cs,
in the aggregate amount of $ 87,506
in favor of the landlord. The L/Cs are in lieu of a security deposit. In order to support the L/Cs,
we agreed to have our bank withdraw $87,506 from our operating accounts and to place that amount in a restricted certificate of deposit.
We have classified that amount as restricted cash, a long-term asset, on our balance sheet.
2.
LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period of computation. Diluted loss per share is computed
similar to basic loss per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional dilutive common shares that
would have been outstanding if potential common shares had been issued, if such additional common shares were dilutive. Since we had net
losses for all periods presented, basic and diluted loss per share are the same, and additional potential common shares have been excluded,
as their effect would be antidilutive.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, an
aggregate of
2,068,252
and
1,587,759
potential common shares, respectively, consisting of shares underlying outstanding stock options, warrants, and restricted stock
units were excluded, as their inclusion would be antidilutive.
9
3.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
Our research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. We incurred research and development expenses during the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, which
are included in various operating expense line items in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Our research
and development expenses in those periods were as follows:

EQUITY TRANSACTIONS IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
2022 At The Market Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright &
Co., LLC
On March 24, 2022, we entered into an At The Market
Offering Agreement, or the 2022 ATM Agreement, with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, or Wainwright, which established an at-the-market
equity program pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time as set forth in the 2022 ATM Agreement.
The offering was registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, pursuant to our shelf registration statement on S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-259909),
as previously filed with the SEC and declared effective on October 21, 2021. We filed a prospectus supplement, dated March 24, 2022, with
the SEC that provides for the sale of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, or the 2022
ATM Shares.
Under the 2022 ATM Agreement, Wainwright may sell
the 2022 ATM Shares by any method permitted by law and deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated
under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or on any other existing trading market for the
2022 ATM Shares. In addition, under the 2022 ATM Agreement, Wainwright may sell the 2022 ATM Shares in privately negotiated transactions
with our consent and in block transactions. Under certain circumstances, we may instruct Wainwright not to sell the 2022 ATM Shares if
the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us from time to time.
We are not obligated to make any sales of the
2022 ATM Shares under the 2022 ATM Agreement. The offering of the 2022 ATM Shares pursuant to the 2022 ATM Agreement will terminate upon
the termination of the 2022 ATM Agreement by Wainwright or us, as permitted therein.
The 2022 ATM Agreement contains customary representations,
warranties and agreements by us, and customary indemnification and contribution rights and obligations of the parties. We agreed to pay
Wainwright a placement fee of up to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of the 2022 ATM Shares. We also agreed to reimburse
Wainwright for certain specified expenses in connection with entering into the 2022 ATM Agreement.
In the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we
raised net proceeds of $ 8,927,211 , net of $ 229,610
in commissions to Wainwright and $ 27,153
in other offering expense, through the sale
of,
7,480,836
shares of our common stock at an average price of $1.19 per share under the 2022 ATM Agreement.
10
Restricted Stock Unit Grants
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
of the Company approved, effective as of April 1, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Amended and Restated Non-Employee
Directors Compensation Policy, or the Directors Compensation Policy, the grant of the annual Restricted Stock Unit awards, or RSUs, to
each of the two non-employee directors of the Company then serving on the Board of Directors of the Company, or Board, and the grant of
an RSU for the then newly appointed director. The RSU grants were made subject to stockholder approval of an increase of
1,800,000
shares
of common stock authorized for issuance under the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2020 Plan, at the Company’s
2022 annual meeting of stockholders. The increase was approved at the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders held in September
2022. The Directors Compensation Policy provides for a grant of stock options or $50,000 worth of RSUs at the beginning of each fiscal
year for current non-employee directors then serving on the Board and for a grant of stock options or $75,000 worth of RSUs for a newly
elected director, with each RSU priced at the average for the closing prices for the five days preceding and including the date of grant,
or $1.46 per share as of April 1, 2022. The two then-current eligible directors each was granted a contingent RSU in the amount of
34,247
shares under the 2020 Plan and the then newly appointed director received a contingent RSU grant for
51,370
shares under the 2020 Plan.
The RSUs are subject to vesting in three installments, 50% on September 30, 2022, and 25% on each of December 31, 2022, and March
31, 2023, subject to the recipient's continued service with the Company on each such vesting date.

All of the stock-based compensation expense recorded
during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, an aggregate of $ 791,588
and $ 522,234 , respectively, is included in payroll and
related expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based compensation expense recorded during
each of the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 represented an impact on basic and diluted loss per common share of $(0.04) in
each period.
We review share-based compensation on a quarterly
basis for changes to the estimate of expected award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience. The cumulative effect of adjusting
the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. The effect of forfeiture
adjustments for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was insignificant.
Stock Option Activity
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
we recognized a stock option grant made in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 to purchase
61,600
shares of our common stock under our
2020 Plan that previously was contingent on stockholder approval of an increase of 1,800,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance
under the 2020 Plan, at the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. The increase was approved at the Company’s 2022
annual meeting of stockholders held in September 2022.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2021,
we issued a stock option grant to Charles J. Fisher, Jr., MD, our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, for the purchase of
266,888
shares

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED REVENUE RECOGNITION
We entered into the following contract with the
National Cancer Institute, or NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, in September 2019:
Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract
On September 12, 2019, the NCI awarded to us an
SBIR Phase II Award Contract, for NIH/NCI Topic 359, entitled “A Device Prototype for Isolation of Melanoma Exosomes for Diagnostics
and Treatment Monitoring”, or the Award Contract. The Award Contract amount is $ 1,860,561
and, as amended, ran for the period from
September 16, 2019 through September 15, 2022.
The work performed pursuant to this Award Contract
was focused on melanoma exosomes. This work followed from our completion of a Phase I contract for the Topic 359 solicitation that ran
from September 2017 through June 2018, as described below. Following on the Phase I work, the deliverables in the Phase II program involved
the design and testing of a pre-commercial prototype of a more advanced version of the exosome isolation platform.
We did not record government contract
revenue on the Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract in the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2022. We recorded $ 114,849
and $ 229,698
of government contract revenue on the Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract in the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2021,
respectively.
The contract ended on September 15, 2022 and we
presented the required final report to the NCI. Once the NCI completes the close out review of the contract, we expect to recognize as
revenue the $ 574,245
currently recorded as deferred revenue on our December 31, 2022 balance sheet.
14
Subaward with University of Pittsburgh
In December 2020, we entered into a cost reimbursable
subaward arrangement with the University of Pittsburgh in connection with an NIH contract entitled “Depleting Exosomes to Improve
Responses to Immune Therapy in HNNCC.” Our share of the award was $ 256,750 . We did not record revenue related to this subaward in
the three- and nine- month periods ended December 31, 2022. We recorded $ 17,117
and $ 51,351
of revenue related to this subaward in the
three- and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
In October 2022, we agreed with the University
of Pittsburgh to terminate the subaward arrangement, effective as of November 10, 2022, since it related to our clinical trial in head
and neck cancer in which the University of Pittsburgh was unable to recruit patients. There are no provisions in the subaward arrangement
requiring repayment of cash received for work completed through November 10, 2022.
11.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LEASE COMMITMENTS
Office, Lab and Manufacturing Space Leases
In December 2020, we entered into an agreement
to lease approximately 2,823 square feet of office space and 1,807 square feet of laboratory space located at 11555 Sorrento Valley Road,
Suite 203, San Diego, California 92121 and 11575 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite 200, San Diego, California 92121, respectively. The agreement
carries a term of 63 months and we took possession of the office space effective October 1, 2021. We took possession of the lab space
effective January 1, 2022. In October 2021, we entered into another lease for (i) approximately 22,260 square feet of space located at
11588 Sorrento Valley Road, San Diego, California 92121, or the Building, and (ii) 2,655 square feet of space located in the Building
and commonly known as Suite 18 to house our manufacturing operations. The term is for 55 months and we took possession of the manufacturing
space in August 2022.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
we recorded a $ 625,471
right-of-use lease asset and associated lease liability related to the manufacturing space component of the lease
based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term of
55
months, discounted using our estimated incremental borrowing
rate of
4.25 %. The current monthly base rent under the manufacturing component of the lease is $ 12,540 .
The office, lab and manufacturing leases are coterminous
with a remaining term of
54
months. The weighted average discount rate is
4.25 %.
As of our December 31, 2022 balance sheet, we
have a right-of-use lease asset of $ 1,217,458 .
In addition, the lease agreements for the new
office, lab and manufacturing space required us to post a standby L/C in favor of the landlord in the aggregate amount of $ 87,506
in lieu
of a security deposit. We arranged for our bank to issue standby L/Cs for the new office and lab in the amounts of $ 46,726
in the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2021 and for the manufacturing space in the amount of $ 40,780
in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. We transferred
like amounts to a restricted certificate of deposit which secured the bank’s risk in issuing those L/Cs. We have classified those
restricted certificates of deposit on our balance sheet as restricted cash with a balance of $ 87,506 .
Mobile Clean Room
In addition, we rented a mobile clean room on
a short term, month-to-month basis, where we housed our manufacturing operations until our permanent manufacturing space was completed.
The mobile clean room was located on leased land near our office and lab and we paid $2,000 per month for the right to locate it there.
We paid approximately $ 167,615
in total rent expense to lease the mobile clean room located on this space during the nine months ended
December 31, 2022. The arrangement was terminated in September 2022 and the mobile clean room was returned to the vendor that leased it
to us.
Overall, our rent expense, which is included in
general and administrative expenses, approximated $ 411,000
and $ 288,000
for the nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
15
LEGAL MATTERS
From time to time, claims are made against us
in the ordinary course of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties
and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more
products or engaging in other activities.
The occurrence of an unfavorable outcome in any
specific period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period or future periods. We are not presently
a party to any pending or threatened legal proceedings.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Management has evaluated events subsequent to
December 31, 2022 through the date that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were filed with the SEC for transactions
and other events which may require adjustment of and/or disclosure in such financial statements.
In January 2023, we entered into an
agreement with North American Science Associates, LLC, or NAMSA, a world leading MedTech CRO offering global end-to-end development
services, to oversee the Company’s clinical trials investigating the Hemopurifier for oncology indications. Pursuant to the
agreement, NAMSA will manage our clinical trials of the Hemopurifier for patients in the United States and Australia with various
types of cancer tumors. We anticipate that the initial clinical trials will begin in Australia.
In
February 2023, we entered into an executive employment agreement with a new Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Lee Arnold, effective February
1, 2023. Dr. Arnold initially will serve as our Chief Scientific Offer on a part-time, three days per week basis. Previously, Dr. LaRosa
served as interim Chief Scientific Officer, as well as our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. LaRosa will continue as our Chief Medical Officer.

Overview
Aethlon Medical, Inc., or
Aethlon, the Company, we or us, is a medical therapeutic company focused on
developing products to diagnose and treat cancer and life-threatening infectious diseases. The Aethlon Hemopurifier is a
clinical-stage immunotherapeutic device designed to combat cancer and life-threatening viral infections. In cancer, the Hemopurifier
is designed to deplete the presence of circulating tumor-derived exosomes that promote immune suppression, seed the spread of
metastasis and inhibit the benefit of leading cancer therapies. The FDA has designated the Hemopurifier as a “Breakthrough
Device” for two independent indications:
·        the
treatment of individuals with advanced or metastatic cancer who are either unresponsive to or intolerant of standard of care therapy,
and with cancer types in which exosomes have been shown to participate in the development or severity of the disease; and
·        the
treatment of life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies.
We believe the Hemopurifier can be a substantial
advance in the treatment of patients with advanced and metastatic cancer through the clearance of exosomes that promote the growth and
spread of tumors through multiple mechanisms. We are currently working with our new contract research organization, or CRO, on preparations
to conduct a clinical trial in Australia in patients with solid tumors, including head and neck cancer, gastrointestinal cancers and
other cancers.
On October 4, 2019, the FDA approved our Investigational
Device Exemption, or IDE, application to initiate an Early Feasibility Study, or EFS, of the Hemopurifier in patients with head and neck
cancer in combination with standard of care pembrolizumab (Keytruda). The primary endpoint for the EFS, designed to enroll 10 to 12 subjects
at a single center, is safety, with secondary endpoints including measures of exosome clearance and characterization, as well as response
and survival rates. This clinical trial, initially conducted at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in Pittsburgh, PA, or UPMC, treated two
patients. Due to lack of further patient enrollment, we and UPMC terminated this trial. We are in the process of designing other clinical
trials in oncology, to include additional solid tumors. These trials initially are planned to be conducted in Australia.
17
We also believe the Hemopurifier can be part of
the broad-spectrum treatment of life-threatening highly glycosylated, or carbohydrate coated, viruses that are not addressed with an already
approved treatment. In small-scale or early feasibility human studies, the Hemopurifier has been used in the past to treat individuals
infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, hepatitis-C and Ebola.
Additionally, in vitro, the Hemopurifier has been
demonstrated to capture Zika virus, Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya virus,
Dengue virus, West Nile virus, smallpox-related viruses, H1N1 swine flu virus, H5N1 bird flu virus, Monkeypox virus and the reconstructed
Spanish flu virus of 1918. In several cases, these studies were conducted in collaboration with leading government or non-government research
institutes.
On June 17, 2020, the FDA approved a supplement
to our open IDE for the Hemopurifier in viral disease to allow for the testing of the Hemopurifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19,
or COVID-19, in a New Feasibility Study. That study was designed to enroll up to 40 subjects at up to 20 centers in the United States.
Subjects will have established laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, be admitted to an intensive care unit, or ICU, and will have acute lung
injury and/or severe or life-threatening disease, among other criteria. Endpoints for this study, in addition to safety, included reduction
in circulating virus as well as clinical outcomes (NCT # 04595903). In June 2022, the first patient in this trial was enrolled and completed
the Hemopurifier treatment phase of the protocol. Under Single Patient Emergency Use regulations, the Company has
treated two patients
with COVID-19 with the Hemopurifier.
We currently are experiencing a disruption in
our Hemopurifier supply, as our existing supply of Hemopurifiers expired on September 30, 2022, and as previously disclosed, we are dependent
on FDA approval of qualified suppliers to manufacture our Hemopurifier. Our intended transition to a new supplier for Galanthus nivalis
agglutinin, or GNA, is delayed as we work with the FDA for approval of our supplement to our Investigational Device Exemption, which is
required to make this manufacturing change.
In October 2022, we launched a wholly owned subsidiary
in Australia, formed to conduct clinical research, seek regulatory approval and commercialize our Hemopurifier in that country. The subsidiary
will initially focus on the oncology market in Australia. There were only insignificant expenses in that subsidiary in the three months
ended December 31, 2022.
We also obtained ethics review board approval
and entered into a clinical trial agreement with Medanta Medicity Hospital, a multi-specialty hospital in Delhi NCR, India, for a COVID-19
clinical trial at that location. One patient has completed participation in the Indian COVID-19 study. The relevant authorities in India
have accepted the use of the Hemopurifiers made with the GNA from our new supplier.
Previously we were the majority owner of Exosome
Sciences, Inc., or ESI, a company formed to focus on the discovery of exosomal biomarkers to diagnose and monitor life-threatening diseases,
and thus consolidated ESI in our consolidated financial statements. For more than four years, the primary activities of ESI were limited
to the payment of patent maintenance fees and applications. In September 2022, the Board of Directors of ESI and the Company, as the majority
stockholder of ESI, approved the dissolution of ESI. Accordingly, ESI is eliminated from our December 31, 2022 balance sheet.
Successful outcomes of human trials will also
be required by the regulatory agencies of certain foreign countries where we plan to sell the Hemopurifier. Some of our patents may expire
before FDA approval or approval in a foreign country, if any, is obtained. However, we believe that certain patent applications and/or
other patents issued more recently will help protect the proprietary nature of the Hemopurifier treatment technology.
In addition to the foregoing, we are monitoring
closely the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, inflation and the war in Ukraine on our business. Given the level of uncertainty regarding
the duration and impact of these events on capital markets and the U.S. economy, we are unable to assess the impact on our timelines and
future access to capital. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and the war in Ukraine will impact our business, results
of operations, financial condition, clinical trials and preclinical research will depend on future developments, as well as the economic
impact on national and international markets that are highly uncertain.

Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital
Market under the symbol “AEMD.”
COVID-19, Inflation and International Conflicts
The COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine
and inflation has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption
of financial markets.  Given the level of uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Ukraine conflict and inflationary environment
on capital markets and the U.S. economy, we are unable to assess the impact of these events on our future access to capital. Further,
while we have not experienced significant disruptions to our manufacturing supply chain, business, results of operations, financial condition,
clinical trials or preclinical research to date, we are unable to assess the potential impact these events could have on our manufacturing
supply chain, business, results of operations, financial condition, clinical trials or preclinical research in the future.
As we continue to actively advance our clinical
trials, we remain in close contact with our clinical sites and are assessing the impact of COVID-19 on our trials, expected timelines
and costs on an ongoing basis. We will assess any potential delays in our ability to timely ship clinical trial materials, including internationally,
due to transportation interruptions. The extent of the impact of COVID-19, the Ukraine conflict and inflation on our operational and financial
performance will depend on certain developments, including the impact on our clinical trials, employees and vendors, all of which are
uncertain and cannot be predicted. Given these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact to our business, operating
results and financial condition, if any.

Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract
On September 12, 2019, the National Cancer Institute,
or NCI, awarded to us an SBIR Phase II Award Contract, for NIH/NCI Topic 359, entitled “A Device Prototype for Isolation of Melanoma
Exosomes for Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring”, or the Award Contract. The Award Contract amount was $1,860,561 and, as amended,
ran for the period from September 16, 2019 through September 15, 2022.
The work performed pursuant to this Award Contract
was focused on melanoma exosomes. This work followed from our completion of a Phase I contract for the Topic 359 solicitation that ran
from September 2017 through June 2018, as described below. Following on the Phase I work, the deliverables in the Phase II program involved
the design and testing of a pre-commercial prototype of a more advanced version of the exosome isolation platform.
We did not record government contract revenue
on the Award Contract in the three months ended December 31, 2022 or in the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The Award Contract ended on September 15, 2022
and we presented the required final report to the NCI. Once the NCI completes the close out review of the contract, we expect to recognize
as revenue the $574,245 currently recorded as deferred revenue on our December 31, 2022 balance sheet.
Subaward with University of Pittsburgh
In December 2020, we entered into a cost reimbursable
subaward arrangement with the University of Pittsburgh in connection with an NIH contract entitled “Depleting Exosomes to Improve
Responses to Immune Therapy in HNNCC.” Our share of the award was $256,750. We did not record revenue related to this subaward in
the three months ended December 31, 2022. We recorded $17,117 of revenue related to this subaward in the three months ended December 31,
2021.
In October 2022, we agreed with the University
of Pittsburgh to terminate the subaward arrangement, effective as of November 10, 2022, since it related to our clinical trial in head
and neck cancer in which the University of Pittsburgh was unable to recruit patients. There are no provisions in the subaward arrangement
requiring repayment of cash received for work completed through November 10, 2022.
Operating Expenses
Consolidated operating expenses for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 were $2,849,753, compared to $2,545,063 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase of
$304,690, or 12%, in the 2022 period was due to increases in our professional fees of $296,261 and in our payroll and related expenses
of $49,261, offset by a decrease in our general and administrative expenses of $40,832.
The $296,261 increase in our professional fees
was primarily due to the combination of a $144,684 increase in our contract labor expense associated with product development and scientific
analytical services, a $73,115 increase in our scientific consulting expense, a $71,029 increase in our legal fees, a $25,622 increase
related to outside regulatory services, and a $21,712 increase associated with recruiting. These expenses were partially offset by a $13,687
decrease in our accounting expenses.
The $49,261 increase in our payroll and related
expenses was due to an increase of $167,520 in salary expense and an increase of $61,594 of stock based compensation expense related to
increased headcount, offset by a decrease of $179,853 in relocation expense.
The $40,832 decrease in our administrative expenses
was due to a $74,894 decrease in clinical trial expenses, a $18,914 decrease in rent expense and a $19,774 decrease in licenses and permits,
which was partially offset by a $60,455 increase in our depreciation expense.
20
Net Loss
As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses
noted above, our net loss increased to approximately $2,850,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $2,528,000
in the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Basic and diluted loss attributable to common
stockholders were ($0.12) for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to ($0.16) for the three month period ended December
31, 2021.

or 36.2%, in the 2022 period was due to increases in our general and administrative expenses of $1,225,779, in our professional fees of
$909,163 and in our payroll and related expenses of $369,552.
The $1,225,779 increase in our general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to the combination of a $470,022 increase in our clinical trial expenses, a $406,410 increase in supplies and
materials, primarily for manufacturing Hemopurifiers, a $146,962 increase in subcontract expenses related to our government contracts,
a $122,912 increase in our rent expense, and a $72,199 increase in our insurance expense.
The $909,163 increase in our professional fees
was primarily due to the combination of a $450,767 increase in our contract labor expense associated with product development and analytical
services, a $204,943 increase in our legal fees, a $145,924 increase in professional fees associated with regulatory strategy services,
a $64,602 increase in our investor relations expenses, primarily related to solicitation expenses associated with our 2022 annual meeting
of stockholders and an increase of $36,485 in scientific consulting related to product development and scientific analytical services.
The $369,552 increase in our payroll and related
expenses was due to an increase in our cash-based compensation expense of $508,620 and stock-based compensation expense of $269,354 due
to our increased headcount. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of $215,000 in bonus expense and $198,347 in relocation
expense.
Other Expense
In September 2022, the Board of Directors of ESI
and Aethlon, as the majority stockholder of ESI, approved the dissolution of ESI. As a result of this dissolution, we recorded a non-cash
charge of $142,121 as other expense in the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Net Loss
As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses
noted above, our net loss increased to approximately $9,563,000 in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $6,635,000
in the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Basic and diluted loss attributable to common
stockholders were ($0.48) for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to ($0.46) for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
22
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance
of $17,499,541 and working capital of $15,736,299. This compares to a cash balance of $17,072,419 and working capital of $16,332,958 at
March 31, 2022. We expect our existing cash as of December 31, 2022 to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months
from the issuance date of these financial statements.
2022 At The Market Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright &
Co., LLC
On March 24, 2022, we entered into an At The Market
Offering Agreement, or the 2022 ATM Agreement, with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, or Wainwright, which established an at-the-market
equity program pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time as set forth in the 2022 ATM Agreement.
The offering was registered under the Securities
Act pursuant to our shelf registration statement on S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-259909), as previously filed with the SEC and
declared effective on October 21, 2021. We filed a prospectus supplement, dated March 24, 2022, with the SEC that provides for the sale
of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, or the 2022 ATM Shares.
Under the 2022 ATM Agreement, Wainwright may sell
the 2022 ATM Shares by any method permitted by law and deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated
under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or on any other existing trading market for the
2022 ATM Shares. In addition, under the 2022 ATM Agreement, Wainwright may sell the 2022 ATM Shares in privately negotiated transactions
with our consent and in block transactions. Under certain circumstances, we may instruct Wainwright not to sell the 2022 ATM Shares if
the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us from time to time.
We are not obligated to make any sales of the
2022 ATM Shares under the 2022 ATM Agreement. The offering of the 2022 ATM Shares pursuant to the 2022 ATM Agreement will terminate upon
the termination of the 2022 ATM Agreement by Wainwright or us, as permitted therein.
The 2022 ATM Agreement contains customary representations,
warranties and agreements by us, and customary indemnification and contribution rights and obligations of the parties. We agreed to pay
Wainwright a placement fee of up to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of the 2022 ATM Shares. We also agreed to reimburse
Wainwright for certain specified expenses in connection with entering into the 2022 ATM Agreement.
In the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we
raised net proceeds of $8,927,211, net of $229,610 in commissions to Wainwright and $27,153 in other offering expense, through the sale
of 7,480,836 shares of our common stock at an average price of $1.19 per share under the 2022 ATM Agreement.

NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES. We used
cash in our operating activities due to our losses from operations. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $7,558,000
in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately $6,668,000 in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The primary
components in the $890,000 increase in cash used in our operating activities in the 2022 period were a $2,928,000 increase in our net
losses, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $653,271, a decrease of prepaid expenses of $626,483
primarily related to our clinical trials, an increase in non-cash charge of $269,354 from stock-based compensation related to increased
headcount, a $142,121 non-cash charge for the loss on dissolution of subsidiary, an increase in deferred revenue of $114,849, a decrease
of $110,000 in accounts receivable, and an increase of $63,000 in depreciation and amortization associated with leasehold improvements.
NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. We used
approximately $932,000 of cash for leasehold improvements and to purchase laboratory and office equipment in the nine months ended December
31, 2022, compared to approximately $137,000 in the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the 2022 period was primarily
a result of leasehold improvements and furnishings for our manufacturing space and purchasing additional laboratory equipment.
NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES. During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we raised approximately $8,927,000 from the issuance of common stock. That source of cash from
our financing activities was partially offset by the use of approximately $10,000 to pay for the tax withholding on restricted stock units,
for an aggregate amount of cash provided by financing activities of approximately $8,917,000.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2021,
we raised approximately $17,456,000 from the issuance of common stock. That source of cash from our financing activities was partially
offset by the use of approximately $77,000 to pay for the tax withholding on restricted stock units, for an aggregate amount of cash provided
by financing activities of approximately $17,379,000.
Material Cash Requirements
As noted above in the results of operations, our
clinical trial expense decreased by $74,894 in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three-month period ended December
31, 2021. However, we expect our clinical trial expenses will increase over the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our clinical
trials both in the United States and internationally.
In addition, we have entered into leases for our
corporate headquarters, laboratory and manufacturing facilities. As noted above in the results of operations, our rent expense increased
by $122,912 in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Future capital requirements will depend upon many
factors, including progress with pre-clinical testing and clinical trials for our Hemopurifier, the number and breadth of our clinical
programs, the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary
rights, the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, competing technological and market developments, as well as our
ability to establish collaborative arrangements, effective commercialization, marketing activities and other arrangements. We expect to
continue to incur increasing negative cash flows and net losses for the foreseeable future. We will continue to need to raise additional
capital either through equity and/or debt financing for the foreseeable future.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires us to make a number of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances.
We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates
under different future conditions.
We believe that the estimates and assumptions
that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most difficult,
subjective or complex judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to us. These critical accounting
estimates relate to revenue recognition, stock purchase warrants issued with notes payable, beneficial conversion feature of convertible
notes payable, impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets, stock compensation, deferred tax asset valuation allowance and contingencies.
There have been no changes to our critical accounting
estimates as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore
are not required to provide the information requested by this item.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.
Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
25
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
From time to time, claims are made against us
in the ordinary course of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties
and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more
products or engaging in other activities.
The occurrence of an unfavorable outcome in any
specific period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period or future periods. We are not presently
a party to any pending or threatened legal proceedings.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
RISK FACTOR SUMMARY
Below is a summary of the principal factors that
make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion
of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading “Risk Factors”
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on June 28, 2022, or Annual Report, and
in this Item 1A below and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our
other filings with the SEC before making investment decisions regarding our securities.
·
We have incurred significant losses and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
·
We will require additional financing to sustain our operations, achieve our business objectives and satisfy our cash obligations, which may dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.
·
We have limited experience in identifying and working with large-scale contracts with medical device manufacturers; manufacture of our devices must comply with good manufacturing practices in the United States.
·
Delays, interruptions or the cessation of production by our third-party suppliers of important materials or delays in qualifying new materials, may prevent or delay our ability to manufacture or process our Hemopurifier.
·
Our Hemopurifier technology may become obsolete.
·
If we fail to comply with extensive regulations of U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies, the commercialization of our products could be delayed or prevented entirely.
·
If we are unable to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.
·
As a public company with limited financial resources undertaking the launch of new medical technologies, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining executive management and directors.
·
We plan to expand our operations, which may strain our resources; our inability to manage our growth could delay or derail implementation of our business objectives.
·
Delays in successfully completing our planned clinical trials could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval.
26
Except for the risk factors set forth below, there
have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report.
The risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report are not the only risks facing our company. Additional
risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition or future results.
Delays, interruptions
or the cessation of production by our third-party suppliers of important materials or delays in qualifying new materials, has and may
continue to prevent or delay our ability to manufacture our Hemopurifier.
Most of the raw materials used in the process
for manufacturing our Hemopurifier are available from more than one supplier. However, there are materials within the manufacturing and
production process that come from single suppliers. We do not have written contracts with all of our single source suppliers, and at any
time they could stop supplying our orders. FDA review of a new supplier is required if these materials become unavailable from our current
suppliers. Currently, we are experiencing an interruption in the manufacturing of our Hemopurifier as we transition to a new supplier
of Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, or GNA, used in the manufacture of our Hemopurifier. We have not received the required FDA approval of
our proposal to approve a new qualified supplier of the GNA and are working with the FDA to gain approval of this supplier. Although we
have recently completed the manufacture of 112 Hemopurifiers, which have passed our quality control measures, we cannot ship the cartridges
until we have FDA approval of our new GNA supplier. FDA review of the new supplier could take several additional months to obtain.
In addition, an uncorrected impurity, a supplier’s
variation in a raw material or testing, either unknown to us or incompatible with its manufacturing process, or any other problem with
our materials, testing or components, would prevent or delay the release of our Hemopurifiers for use in our clinical trials. For example,
in late 2020, we identified during our device quality review procedures prior to product release that one of our critical suppliers had
produced a Hemopurifier component that was not produced to our specifications, although no affected Hemopurifiers were released into our
inventory or to any clinical trial sites. Our current inventory of Hemopurifiers expired on September 30, 2022. Any further delay
in achieving the required FDA approvals for our new supplier will limit our ability to meet any demand for the Hemopurifier in the United
States. and delay our clinical trials in the United States., which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.
Difficulties in
manufacturing our Hemopurifier could have an adverse effect upon our expenses, our product revenues and our ability to complete our clinical
trials.
We currently outsource most of the
manufacturing of our Hemopurifier. The manufacturing of our Hemopurifier is difficult and complex. To support our current clinical
trial needs, we comply with and intend to continue to comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our product. Our ability to adequately
manufacture and supply our Hemopurifier in a timely matter is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our
facilities and those of third parties producing raw materials and supplies upon which we rely in our manufacturing. We currently are
experiencing an interruption in our Hemopurifier manufacturing due to delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approval of a new
manufacturer of GNA. The manufacture of our products may also be impacted by:
·
availability or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier;
·
our ability to comply with new regulatory requirements, including our ability to comply with cGMP;
·
natural disasters;
·
changes in forecasts of future demand for product components;
·
potential facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses;
·
updating of manufacturing specifications;
·
product quality success rates and yields; and
·
global viruses and pandemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.
The current interruption in the manufacture and
supply of our Hemopurifier has and may continue to delay shipments of our Hemopurifier for use in clinical trials in the United States.
27
Our products are
manufactured with raw materials that are sourced from specialty suppliers with limited competitors and we may therefore be unable to access
the materials we need to manufacture our products.
Specifically, the Hemopurifier contains three
critical components with limited supplier numbers. The base cartridge on which the Hemopurifier is constructed is sourced from Medica
S.p.A and we are dependent on the continued availability of these cartridges. We currently purchase the diatomaceous earth from Janus
Scientific Inc., our distributor; however, the product is manufactured by Imerys Minerals Ltd., which is the only supplier of this product.
The GNA is sourced from Vector Laboratories, Inc. and also is available from other suppliers; however, Sigma Aldrich is our only back
up supplier at this time and we are in the process of working with the FDA to obtain regulatory approval for this supplier. A business
interruption at any of these sources, including the interruption resulting from the delay in obtaining FDA approval of our new GNA supplier,
has and may continue to have a material impact on our ability to manufacture the Hemopurifier.
If we are unable to regain compliance with
the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital
Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of
publicly held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share (subject to a 180-day grace period, as discussed below),
and minimum stockholders' equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one
or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.
On October 25, 2022, we received a notice, or
Notice, from The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, that we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued
listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), or the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Notice
indicated that, consistent with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had 180 days, or until April 24, 2023, to regain compliance with
the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by having the closing bid price of our common stock meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten
consecutive business days.
If we do not achieve compliance with the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement by April 24, 2023, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify,
we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of its publicly held shares and all other Nasdaq initial
listing standards, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and would need to provide written notice of our intention to cure
the deficiency during the second compliance period. However, if it appears to Nasdaq staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency,
or if we do not meet the other listing standards, Nasdaq could provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. In the
event we receive notice that our common stock is being delisted, we would be entitled to appeal the determination to a Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel and request a hearing.
There can be no assurance, however, that we will
be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Even if we do regain compliance, we may not be able to maintain compliance
with the continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market or our common stock could be delisted in the future. In addition,
we may be unable to meet other applicable listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders’
equity or market values of our common stock in which case, our common stock could be delisted notwithstanding our ability to demonstrate
compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.
Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market may adversely
affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the
ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could
have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business
development opportunities.
28
If we are delisted from Nasdaq and we are not
able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the “pink sheets.”
As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others:
·
a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;
·
a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;
·
a limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage for us;
·
an inability to qualify for exemptions from state securities registration requirements, which may require us to comply with applicable state securities laws; and
·
a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing in the future.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.
We did not issue or sell any unregistered securities during the three
months ended December 31, 2022.
ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.
We have no disclosure applicable to this item.
ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.
We have no disclosure applicable to this item.
ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.
We have no disclosure applicable to this item.
