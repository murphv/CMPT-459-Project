CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2022 (the “Quarterly Report”) contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements relate to future events including, without limitation, our ability to raise
capital, our operational and strategic initiatives or our future financial performance. We have attempted to identify forward-looking
statements by using terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “can,”
“continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,”
“plans,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” or “will” or the negative of these
terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions; uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels or activity, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Our expectations are
as of the date this Quarterly Report is filed, and we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this
Quarterly Report is filed to confirm these statements to actual results, unless required by law.
You
should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this Quarterly Report identify
important factors which you should consider in evaluating our forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things:
●
Our
ability to effectively execute our business plans including transitioning from being focused on end-to-end consumer product innovation,
development, and commercialization to being focused on digital media, advertising and content technologies innovation, development,
and commercialization;
●
Our
ability to manage our expansion, growth and operating expenses;
●
Our
ability to protect our brands, reputation and intellectual property rights;
●
Our
ability to obtain adequate financing to support our development plans;
●
Our
ability to repay our debts;
●
Our
ability to rely on third-party suppliers, content contributors, developers, and other business partners;
●
Our
ability to evaluate and measure our business, prospects and performance metrics;
●
Our
ability to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry;
●
Our
ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior;
●
Our
dependence on information technology, and being subject to potential cyberattacks, security problems, network disruptions, and other
incidents;
●
Our
ability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations including those relating to privacy, data use and data protection,
content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, digital assets and other matters, many of which are subject to
change and uncertain interpretation;
●
Our
ability to enhance disclosure and financial reporting controls and procedures and remedy the existing weakness;
●
Risks
in connection with completed or potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic growth opportunities and initiatives;
●
Risks
related to the integration of completed acquisitions and the achievement of our expected benefits from our acquisitions and
investments, including, but not limited to, our investment in Lomotif Private Limited (“Lomotif”) through ZVV Media
Partners, LLC (“ZVV”), our investment in Magnifi U Inc. (“Magnifi U”), our joint venture with ZASH Global
Media and Entertainment Corporation (“ZASH”), and our acquisitions of AdRizer, LLC (“AdRizer”) and Honey
Badger Media, LLC (“Honey Badger”);
●
Various
risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)
pandemic, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows;
●
Other
risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Specifically,
our investment in Lomotif and related growth initiatives may fail to deliver our expected benefits, for reasons relating to including,
but not limited to, our and Lomotif’s capital requirements and whether we will be able to raise capital as needed; our ability
to successfully develop the business and revenue models for Lomotif’s social media platform; whether Lomotif can retain its existing
users and attract new users to its platform; whether our cross-platform user engagement strategy will enhance our ability to monetize
the Lomotif platform; whether Lomotif can attract and maintain relationships with influencers, artists, and other content creators or
publishers who will provide compelling content to the platform; our ability to integrate the operations of Lomotif within the Vinco Ventures
conglomerate and create synergies between Lomotif and other businesses and assets we have acquired or plan to acquire, including AdRizer;
the ability of Lomotif’s platform and associated promotional activities to compete effectively for user engagement; Lomotif’s
ability to retain reliable developers, vendors and suppliers to support its operations; failure of third parties to promote Lomotif’s
platform and associated products and services effectively or at all; breaches of network and data security measures; a disruption or
failure of networks and information systems; Lomotif’s ability to protect its patents and other intellectual property and operate
its businesses without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others; changes in local, state, federal and international
laws and regulations that may adversely affect Lomotif’s business or prospects; risk of attempts at unauthorized or improper use
of the platform and resulting damages to Lomotif’s reputation; the inability to maintain or increase the value of the Lomotif brands;
the inability to successfully respond to rapid changes in technologies and user tastes and preferences and remain competitive; the impact
of any legal proceedings or governmental action against Lomotif; and whether Lomotif will continue to receive the services of key management
and retain qualified personnel.
In
addition, AdRizer’s advertising business and our efforts to integrate AdRizer with our other businesses or investments such as
Lomotif and Honey Badger are subject to risks including, but not limited to, AdRizer is faced with intensive competition in the digital
advertising industry; high customer concentration, long sales cycles and payment-related risks may subject AdRizer to significant fluctuations
or declines in revenues; the reliability of operational and performance issues with AdRizer’s platform, whether real or perceived,
including a failure to respond to technological changes or to upgrade its technology systems, may adversely affect AdRizer’s business
and operational results; AdRizer’s technology solutions are dependent on third parties including data hosting service, data providers
and various technology, software, products and services from third parties or available as open source; AdRizer’s business practices
are subject to governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy, data protection and consumer
protection, and unfavorable changes or failure by AdRizer to comply with these laws and regulations could substantially harm its business;
and to the extent the use of “third-party cookies” or other technology to uniquely identify devices is rejected by Internet
users, restricted by government regulations, blocked or limited by technical changes on end users’ devices and web browsers, AdRizer’s
performance may decline and AdRizer may lose advertisers.
These
and other factors discussed above could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by any independent
parties and by us.

NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note
1 —
Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations
Unaudited
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Information
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial statements and with Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain all information
and footnotes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present
the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and the results of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for the periods presented. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2022 or for any other interim period or for any other future year.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021 (the “Annual Report”). The Company’s accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and updated, as necessary, in this Quarterly
Report.
Description
of the Business
Vinco
Ventures is focused on digital media, advertising and content technologies.
As
of June 30, 2022, Vinco Ventures wholly-owned subsidiaries included: AdRizer, Vinco Ventures Shared Services LLC, Honey Badger, EVNT
Platform LLC DBA Emmersive Entertainment (“EVNT”), Love is Blurred LLC and Edison Nation Holdings, LLC. Edison Nation
Holdings, LLC is the single member of Edison Nation, LLC and Everyday Edisons, LLC. Edison Nation, LLC is the single member of Safe
TV Shop, LLC. Vinco Ventures owns a
50 %
voting membership interest and a
25 %
economic interest after return of unreturned capital contributions in ZVV, which are consolidated as Variable Interest Entities
(“VIE”) with noncontrolling interests. ZVV owns
80 %
of the outstanding equity interests in Lomotif and Lomotif owns
100 %
of Lomotif, Inc. Vinco Ventures also has an outstanding loan with Magnifi U Inc which is consolidated as a VIE with a noncontrolling
interest.
Going
Concern and Liquidity
These
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting
contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities in the normal course of business.
The
Company has incurred and continues to incur losses from operations as well as negative cash flows from operations. For the six
months ended June 30, 2022, the Company had a net loss of $ 242,448,937 ,
negative cash flows from operations of $ 72,471,541
and
an accumulated deficit of $ 963,776,852 .
On June 30, 2022, the Company postponed its special stockholder meeting from July 1, 2022 to July 26, 2022 which was subsequently
postponed again to August 23, 2022 and then postponed indefinitely. This meeting was to be held to approve various proposals
including amending the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of its authorized
shares of common stock from
250,000,000
to
750,000,000 .
The postponement of the meeting triggered an alternative exercise notice clause in the Company’s November and December 2021
warrants, as amended, which allows the holder to put the warrants back to the Company in exchange for cash payments of $ 0.65
and
$ 0.36
per
warrant for the November and December 2021 warrants, respectively (Note 12 – Warrant Liability). The Holder exercised this
provision in July 2022 resulting in a cash payment of $ 33,886,612
and
cancelation of
82,260,699
warrants.
Additionally, per the terms of the amended July 2021 convertible note the Company made a cash payment of $ 33,000,000
against principal and cash interest payment of $ 115,500
on July 19, 2022. On August 18, 2022, the Company paid an additional
$ 65,000,000
to the note holder, of which $ 55,000,000
was applied to the principal.
These
payments along with our cash flows from operations have reduced our cash balance from $ 179,216,863
at
June 30, 2022 to approximately $ 10,000,000
in Restricted Cash and $ 5,500,000
in unrestricted cash
at
January 31, 2023. At June 30, 2022 we have approximately $ 14.7
million
in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and during the first six months of 2022, we utilized approximately $ 1
million
in cash per month. Furthermore, due to the postponement of special stockholder meeting, the Company’s ability to raise
additional cash through issuance of common shares is limited. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern and meet its obligations through twelve months following the date the condensed consolidated
financial statements are issued.
9
Management’s
plans include evaluating different strategies to obtain required funding for future operations, develop and implement cost reduction
initiatives, and pursue revenue generating programs with strategic partners. As these plans have not yet been implemented, management
has concluded that substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern has not been alleviated.
The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vinco Ventures, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, majority owned subsidiaries
and consolidated variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use
of Estimates
Preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the financial statements.
The
Company’s significant estimates used in these financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounts receivable reserves,
the valuation allowance related to the Company’s deferred tax assets, the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets,
debt conversion features, stock-based compensation, certain assumptions related to the valuation of the reserved shares and the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed related to the Company’s acquisitions. Certain of the Company’s estimates could be affected
by external conditions, including those unique to the Company and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external
factors could have an effect on the Company’s estimates and could cause actual results to differ from those estimates.
Significant
Accounting Policies
Significant
accounting policies are disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There have
been no changes in such policies or the application of such policies during the six months ended June 30, 2022. As a result of the acquisition
of Adrizer, the Company added a new revenue stream, Digital Media Advertising and Licensing, to its Revenue Recognition policy. Additionally,
as a result of the Company’s interest in Love is Blurred, the Company has recorded Film and Television Production assets in accordance
with Topic 926. As a result of these changes in the first six months of 2022, new Investments have been recognized. The details for each
of these topics are as follows:
10
Revenue
Recognition
The Company considers all revenues as arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized based on the five-step process outlined
in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 as disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional clarification on the Company’s Digital
Media Advertising and Licensing revenue recognition policy is provided below.
Digital
Media Advertising and Licensing
The
Company’s digital media advertising revenues are generated primarily from the posting of original digital content through third-party
online platforms which are then delivered to users of the online platform across the customer’s digital advertising platform and
becomes monetizable to the Company, which the Company concludes is its performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue when control
of the services are transferred to customers and the transaction price is determined by the third-party online platform. Revenue from
the digital media platform is primarily recognized based on impressions delivered to customers. An “impression” is delivered
when an advertisement appears on pages viewed by users. For impressions-based digital advertising, revenues are recognized as impressions
are delivered over the term of the arrangement, while revenue from non-impressions-based digital advertising is recognized over the period
that the advertisements are displayed. Such amounts are recognized net of agency commissions and provisions for estimated sales incentives,
including rebates, rate adjustments or discounts.
Licensing revenues are derived from the sale of a licensee’s products that
incorporates the Company’s intellectual property. Royalty revenues are recognized during the quarter in which the Company receives
a report from the licensee detailing the shipment of products that incorporate the Company’s intellectual property, which receipt
is in the quarter following the licensee’s sale of such products to its customers. Royalties are calculated as a percentage of
the revenues received by the Company’s licensees on sales of products incorporating the Company’s intellectual property.
Identification of a Customer and Gross Versus Net
Revenue Recognition
In the normal course of business,
the Company acts as or uses an intermediary or agent in executing transactions with third parties. When the intermediary or agent is determined
to be the Company’s customer, the Company records revenue based on the amount it expects to receive from the agent or intermediary.
In other circumstances, the determination of whether
revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether the Company is acting as the principal or an agent
in the transaction. If the Company is acting as a principal in a transaction, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis. If the Company
is acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company reports revenue on a net basis. The determination of whether the Company is acting
as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of the terms of the arrangement. The Company
serves as the principal in transactions in which it controls the goods or services prior to being transferred to the ultimate customer.
For AdRizer, FASB ASC 606 requires an entity to determine whether it is a principal (recognizes revenue at the gross amount) or an agent
(recognizes revenue at the net amount) for each promised good or service. Based on the FASB guidance, the Company has determined that
AdRizer is the principal for each promised good or service, thus, revenue is recognized at the gross amount of the transactions. Revenue
from traffic sales and traffic management services are generally recognized at the end of each month when the performance obligation
is satisfied.
Film
and Television Productions
The
Company accounts for the film and television productions in accordance with Topic 926,
Entertainment – Films . Production
costs qualifying for capitalization, are recorded as film and television productions on the consolidated balance sheet and amortized
using forecast methods that match amortization to estimated revenue. Currently all productions are actively under development and, as
such, amortization has not commenced.
Investments
Investments
in equity securities (excluding equity method investments) with readily determinable fair values are accounted for at fair value. For investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, the Company elects the measurement
alternative permitted under GAAP to measure these investments at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable
price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
Investments
in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control and is not the primary beneficiary are equity
method investments. Significant influence typically exists if the Company has a 20% to 50% ownership interest in a venture unless persuasive
evidence to the contrary exists. Under this method of accounting, the Company records its proportionate share of the net earnings or
losses of equity method investees and a corresponding increase or decrease to the investment balances. Cash payments to equity method
investees such as additional investments, loans and advances and expenses incurred on behalf of investees as well as payments from equity
method investees such as dividends, distributions and repayments of loans and advances are recorded as adjustments to investment balances.
The Company applies the cumulative earnings approach for determining the cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity
method investees. Distributions received are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities, unless the
cumulative distributions exceed the Company’s portion of the cumulative equity in the net earnings of the equity method investment,
in which case the excess distributions are deemed to be returns of the investment and are classified as investing activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flows. The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
AdRizer, LLC
On
February 11, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of AdRizer and cancelled all outstanding performance
units under AdRizer’s phantom equity plan (“Performance Units”) pursuant to that certain Unit Purchase Agreement among
the Company, AdRizer, the members of AdRizer and the holders of Performance Units of AdRizer (collectively, the “Seller Members”),
and Innovative Assets LLC, in its capacity as the sellers’ representative (the “Unit Purchase Agreement”), resulting
in AdRizer becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price paid and payable consists of (i) $ 38
million in cash
paid at closing, of which $ 10
million was deposited in an escrow account to secure the Seller Members’ indemnification obligations
under the Unit Purchase Agreement, subject to customary post-closing adjustments for working capital and other items, and (ii) up to
10
million shares of the Company’s common stock to be issued on January 1, 2024, determined by dividing $ 50
million by the volume
weighted average price of the Company’s common stock reported by Bloomberg LP for the 20 trading days preceding such date, subject
to a floor price of $ 5.00
and maximum price of $ 8.00
per share (the “Purchase Price Equity”). The Company estimated the fair
value of the Purchase Price Equity to be issued was $ 23,250,000 .
If
a Company change of control transaction occurs on or prior to January 1, 2024, the issuance of the Purchase Price Equity may be accelerated
to allow each Seller Member to participate in such transaction on the same terms as other common stockholders of the Company (the “Acceleration”),
provided that, to the extent that the consideration to be paid to the common stockholders of the Company in such transaction does not
consist entirely of cash or free-trading securities listed on a national stock exchange, (i) each Seller Member may elect the Acceleration
except with respect to Purchase Price Equity issuable in respect of the Performance Units, and (b) if any Seller Member has not elected
the Acceleration, to the extent permitted and with respect to the Performance Units, the Company shall (i) pay each such applicable Seller
Member a cash amount equal to
50 % of such Seller’s Member’s pro rata portion of the Purchase Price Equity (the “Forfeited
Purchase Price Equity”) and (ii) issue such Seller Member’s pro rata portion of the Purchase Price Equity less the Forfeited
Purchase Price Equity.
Upon
the closing of the acquisition, AdRizer entered into a new employment agreement with its chief executive officer, Kenneth Bond. Certain
Seller Members including those who are employees, officers, directors or managers of AdRizer and their affiliates also agreed to be bound
by three-year post-closing non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement.
11
The
Company has accounted for the AdRizer acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. The Company has
classified the Purchase Price Equity as a deferred acquisition liability.
The
purchase price allocation presented below is preliminary given the recent closing of the AdRizer acquisition. We are in the process of
evaluating additional information necessary to finalize the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition
date including, but not limited to, post-closing adjustments to the working capital acquired and identification and valuation of developed
technology and intangible assets acquired which include customer relationships and trade name, and the fair value of AdRizer’s
investment in Mind Tank, LLC, of which we own 50% as a result of our ownership of AdRizer.
The fair value in AdRizer, and AdRizer’s
investment in Mind Tank, used several methodologies to arrive at the current estimate.  To value assets, fixed assets were reported
at NBV
which approximates fair value.  The fair
value of the intangible assets employed the following methodologies: customer relationships (Distributor method); developed technology
(Multi- period Excess Earnings Method); trade name (Relief-from-Royalty); and the existing workforce was also valued (Replacement Cost
method) but is included in Goodwill for reporting purposes.  The estimated useful life of the various intangibles was based on the
cash flow estimated for the particular asset. Qualitative factors regarding the valuation included expected synergies between businesses
and integration of the technology.
The
following purchase price allocation is preliminary and details management’s
estimate and allocation of the purchase price
and fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of closing.

During
the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company made a provisional estimate and adjustment for amortization of the preliminary intangible
assets including customer list, developed technology, and trade name. The Company has estimated a
seven -year useful life and recorded
amortization expense of approximately $ 1,752,000
during the six months ended June 30, 2022. The final fair value determination could
result in material adjustments to the values presented in the preliminary purchase price allocation, including the fair value of Mind
Tank, LLC, intangible assets, goodwill and the related tax impact of such adjustments. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation
within the measurement period.
The
Company recognized $ 8,216,000
of acquisition related costs, including $ 6,750,000
paid to ZASH for the assignment of ZASH’s rights
under a letter of intent to acquire AdRizer (See Note 13- Related Party Transactions) that were expensed during the six months ended
June 30, 2022. These costs are included in the consolidated statement of operations in the line item entitled “Selling, General
and Administrative”.

The
activity of AdRizer is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date to June 30, 2022.
The amounts of revenue and earnings of AdRizer from the acquisition date of February 11, 2022 to June 30, 2022 are as follows:

PZAJ
Holdings, LLC
On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement
with PZAJ Holdings, LLC (“PZAJ”) to Convert Promissory Note to Capital Contributions (“5/12/2022 Conversion Agreement”).
Under the 5/12/2022 Conversion Agreement, the Company was to be admitted as a PZAJ Member with
51 % ownership subject to the terms of the
agreement.
Because condition(s)
precedent to the Company’s admission to PZAJ as a member and to the May 12, 2022 Agreement to Convert Promissory Note to Capital
Contributions failed to occur, the Company did not record a membership interest in PZAJ. The notes receivable due from PZAJ will continue
to be reported by the Company.  Because the intent is to be admitted as a member
in
exchange for the cancellation of the notes receivable, the Company will not establish a reserve against the loans that are included in
the conversion agreement as the fair value of the membership interest approximates the fair value of the loans receivable.
During
the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company held loans for investment with PZAJ, which totaled $ 5,740,000 .
The notes accrue interest at
2 % with a
one-year repayment term and are repaid through 50% of net revenues , as defined, of the related
productions. On July 7, 2022, the Company entered into an additional note for $ 840,000
accruing interest at
6 % with a
two-year repayment
term .
The notes are principally funding film or TV production assets, all of
which are still in production. As of June 30, 2022, $ 950,000
of the loans have matured, and not been repaid to the Company.
13
Asset
Acquisitions
Love is Blurred, LLC
On June 21,
2022, ZASH and the Company entered into a Love is Blurred LLC Membership Interest Assignment Agreement (“LIB Membership
Interest Agreement”). Pursuant to the LIB Membership Interest Agreement, ZASH sold
100 %
of its membership interest in Love Is Blurred (“LIB”) to the Company to purchase
100 %
Membership Interests in LIB LLC from ZASH. The purchase price for the LIB asset was $ 531,279 .
Consideration to ZASH for the acquired asset was the reduction of outstanding principal by $ 1,048,750
and outstanding interest by
$ 201,250
(totaling $ 1,250,000 ) on a loan between the Company and ZASH. The acquisition closed on June 21, 2022. The fair value of
the asset was determined to be $ 531,279 ,
and a loss on the Love is Blurred LLC acquisition of $ 718,721
was recognized .
The LIB LLC assets consist principally of a single film production asset.
Because the LIB LLC is not a business, the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset.
Emmersive
Entertainment Asset Contribution
On
April 17, 2021, Vinco and EVNT entered into (and closed on) a certain Asset Contribution Agreement (“Asset Contribution Agreement”)
with Emmersive Entertainment, Inc. (“Emmersive”), pursuant to which Emmersive contributed/transferred to the Company the
assets used for Emmersive’s business, which include digital assets, software and certain physical assets (the “Contributed
Assets”) in consideration for, among other things, the Company assuming certain obligations of Emmersive, hiring certain employees,
and issuing
1,000,000
preferred membership units (“Preferred
Units”) in the Company to Emmersive and/or its shareholders (“Preferred Members”) pursuant to a First Amended and Restated
Operating Agreement for the Company dated as of April 17, 2021(“Amended Operating Agreement”). Certain put rights are associated
with Preferred Units, which if exercised by the Preferred Members, obligates Vinco to purchase the Preferred Units in exchange for
1,000,000
shares of Vinco Venture’s common stock
(“Put Rights”). In addition, the Preferred Members have the opportunity to earn up to
4,000,000
Conditional Preferred Units if certain conditions
are satisfied for each of the four earn out targets (“Earn-Out Targets”).
On
April 17, 2021, the transactions under both the Asset Contribution Agreement and Amended Operating Agreement closed. The Preferred Units
and Conditional Preferred Units were valued at $ 2,100,000
and $ 5,300,000 , respectively, and recorded as an intangible asset. On October
19, 2021, the Preferred Unit Holders were issued
1,000,000
shares of common stock of Vinco in exchange for the Preferred Units.

On
February 25, 2022, Emmersive, certain former shareholders of Emmersive (collectively, the “Emmersive Parties”), the
Company and EVNT entered into a Termination and Release Agreement, terminating certain transaction documents dated April 17, 2021,
in connection with which the Emmersive Parties and our subsidiary Cryptyde, Inc (“Cryptyde”) also entered into a Milestone Agreement for the earnout
shares to be earned and any remaining consideration to be paid by Cryptyde with an effective date of both the agreements upon the
spin- off of Cryptyde being declared effective by the SEC (the “Effective Date”). Upon the Effective Date, the
agreements released the Company of the obligation to deliver the additional
4,000,000
earn-out
shares provided under the Asset Contribution Agreement. The Cryptyde spin-off occurred on June 29, 2022, and therefore the Company
is no longer liable for any contingent consideration to Emmersive.
In addition, with the sale of Cryptyde, there
was a change in how the Company planned to utilize the EVNT platform from its acquisition. Management made the determination that it was
no longer interested in continuing to operate and profit from E-NFT. The developed
technology intangible asset for the EVNT platform of $ 6,607,989
(net of amortization) was fully impaired at September 30, 2022. (See Note
17 – Subsequent Events | Impairment Charges)
Divestitures
CBAV1,
LLC Divestiture
On
March 12, 2021, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the CBAV1, LLC Assets to BTL Diffusion SARL, the winning bidder, at the auction
held on March 10, 2021 and March 11, 2021 for a total sum of $ 3,000,000 , which includes a cash payment at closing in the amount of $ 2,650,000 ,
less certain closing costs and credits, and additional royalty payments in the amount of $ 150,000
on April 15, 2022 and in the amount
of $ 200,000
on April 15, 2023 (“ CBAV1-BTL Transaction ”).
A
first closing of the CBAV1-BTL Transaction occurred on April 16, 2021, with the transfer of assets and release of funds completed on
April 21, 2021 (“ Final Closing ”). Contemporaneously with the Final Closing, a certain license agreement between CBAV1
and Edison Nation, LLC (“ Edison Nation ”) terminated and any remaining operational assets of Edison Nation were transferred
to BTL.

Spin-Off
of Cryptyde, Inc .
On
November 8, 2021, Cryptyde initially filed, and on January 25, 2022, March 18, 2022 and May 13, 2022 amended, a Form 10
registration statement with the SEC (the “Form 10”) in connection with our planned spin-off of
100 % of the outstanding shares
of common stock of Cryptyde to our shareholders, subject to certain conditions as described in the registration statement, including
the effectiveness of the registration statement, receipt of an opinion of counsel to the effect that, among other things, the spin-off
and related transactions should qualify as tax-free for United States federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355
of the Internal Revenue Code, and Nasdaq having approved the listing of Cryptyde’s common stock. Cryptyde, along with our subsidiaries CW Machines LLC and Ferguson Containers
(the “Cryptyde Businesses”), held our packaging,
Bitcoin mining services, and Web3 (decentralized internet) products businesses.
On
May 16, 2022, the Form 10 was declared effective. The Record Date for the spin-off was May 18, 2022. Effective June 29, 2022,
Cryptyde
separated from the Company and the distribution of its common stock was completed. Upon completion of the spin-off, Cryptyde became an
independent, publicly traded company (NasdaqCM: TYDE). The distribution was made in the amount of one share of Cryptyde common stock
for every ten shares of our common stock owned by our stockholders at the close of business on the Record Date.
Also,
in connection with the spinoff, we entered into definitive agreements with Cryptyde that, among other things, set forth the terms and
conditions of the separation and distribution. The agreements set forth the principles and actions taken or to be taken in connection
with the separation and the distribution and provide a framework for our relationship with Cryptyde from and after the separation and
the distribution. The agreements include a Separation and Distribution Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement.
On
January 26, 2022,
Cryptyde entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor for the issuance of a (i)
1,500,000 shares of Cryptyde Common Stock, and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of Cryptyde Common
Stock with an exercise price of $8.00 per share of Cryptyde Common Stock. In addition, Cryptyde issued a warrant to the
placement agent to purchase up to 240,000 shares of Cryptyde Common Stock with an initial exercise price of $8.00 per
share of Cryptyde Common Stock. The transaction closed on May 20, 2022.
On June 29, 2022,
Vinco Ventures,
Inc. distributed 100% of the shares of Cryptyde’s common stock held by Vinco to holders of shares of Vinco common stock, subject
to certain conditions . On the Distribution Date, each holder of Vinco common stock received one share of Cryptyde common stock for every
ten shares of Vinco common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date.
The results of our Cryptyde businesses have been reflected as discontinued
operations in the current year period through the date of the spinoff and in the prior year period.

Variable Interest Entities
The
Company is involved in the formation of various entities considered to be VIEs. The Company
evaluates the consolidation of these entities as required pursuant to ASC Topic 810 relating to the consolidation of VIEs.
The
Company’s determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of VIE is based in part on an assessment of whether or not the
Company and its related parties are exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards of the entity. Typically, the Company is entitled
to substantially all or a portion of the economics of these VIEs. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE entities. The assets
of the VIEs can be used to settle obligations of the consolidated entities. Conversely, liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating
these VIEs do not represent additional claims on the Company’s general assets.
The
following table presents the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of entities that are VIEs and consolidated by the Company
as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”) which defines a fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level
1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level
2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable
Level
3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)
The
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, such as cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair
values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s notes payable approximates fair
value because the effective yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates, taken together with other features
such as concurrent issuance of warrants, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk.

Bay Financing – July 2021
On
July 22, 2021 Vinco Ventures consummated a private placement offering (the “July 2021 Offering”) whereby pursuant to the
Securities Purchase Agreement (the “July 2021 Purchase Agreement”) entered into by the Company on July 22, 2021 with Hudson
Bay Master Fund Ltd as investor the Company issued a Senior Secured Convertible Note in the amount of $ 120,000,000
for the purchase price
of $ 100,000,000
(the “July 2021 Note”) and five ( 5 ) year warrants (the “July 2021 Warrant”) to purchase shares
of the common stock of the Company (“Common Stock”). The Company placed $ 100,000,000
of cash into a restricted bank account
under a deposit account control agreement as collateral for the July 2021 Note. The Company recorded a deferred discount of $ 120,000,000
which consisted of the $ 20,000,000
original issue discount, $ 9,300,000
of fees paid to placement agents and lawyers, and $ 90,700,000
related to the issuance of warrants.
The
July 2021 Note, as amended carries interest at
6.0 % per annum and is payable quarterly. The July 2021 Note originally matured on
July
22, 2022 . The July 2021 Note contains a voluntary conversion mechanism whereby the noteholder may convert at any time after the Initial
Convertibility Date (as defined in the July 2021 Note), in whole or in part, the outstanding principal and interest under the July 2021
Note into shares of Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price of $ 4.00
per share. The July 2021 Note is guaranteed by the Company’s
subsidiaries and certain other guarantors and is a senior secured obligation of the Company and its subsidiaries. The July 2021 Note
contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs, interest under the July 2021 Note will accrue at a rate of eighteen
percent ( 18 %) per annum and the outstanding principal amount of the July 2021 Note, plus accrued but unpaid interest, liquidated damages
and other amounts owing with respect to the July 2021 Note will become, at the noteholder’s election, immediately due and payable
in cash. Upon completion of a Change of Control (as defined in the July 2021 Note), the July 2021 Note holder may require the Company
to purchase any outstanding portion of the July 2021 Note in cash at a price in accordance with the terms of the July 2021 Note.

Palladium
Capital Group, LLC. acted as placement agent for the July 2021 Offering.
The
placement agent received $ 9,000,000
of which $ 1,000,000
was cash compensation and $ 8,000,000
was deferred cash compensation ( 8 %
of the gross proceeds to the Company plus an additional 1% of the gross proceeds to the Company for non-accountable expenses). The
Company has paid $ 4,000,000
of the deferred cash compensation and $ 4,000,000
remains outstanding in accounts payable as of June 30, 2022.
Pursuant
to the July 2021 Purchase Agreement, the investor received the July 2021 Warrant. The July 2021 Warrant contained an exercise price of
$ 2.655
per share, subject to adjustments as provided under the terms of the July 2021 Warrant. In connection with the closing of the
July 2021 Offering, the July 2021 Warrant was issued for an aggregate of
32,697,548
shares of Common Stock. The conversion features on
the July 2021 Note and the July 2021 Warrant were approved by the Company’s stockholders on October 14, 2021. On November 9, 2021
the investor converted $ 7,000,000
of principal under the July 2021 Note in exchange for
1,750,000
shares of Common Stock.
On
March 9, 2022, the Company, Cryptyde and the noteholder of the July 2021 Note entered into an Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment
Agreement”) whereby the parties agreed to, among other things:
(i) amend certain provisions of the July 2021 Note to (a) convert
$ 10,000
of the principal amount of the July 2021 Note at a conversion price of $ 0.01
into shares of Common Stock, (b) extend the maturity
date under the July Note to July 22, 2023, (c) increase the interest rate on the July 2021 Note from zero percent (0%) to six percent
(6.0%), (d) reduce the maximum cap of the minimum cash in the control account from $ 100,000,000
to $ 80,000,000 , and (e) require the Company
to redeem $ 33,000,000
of the principal of the July 2021 Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest and accrued and unpaid late charges
on such principal and interest, on July 22, 2022; (ii) to extend certain dates relating to (x) the Company’s registration of certain
securities under the Warrant Exercise Agreements dated September 1, 2021, November 11, 2021 and December 20, 2021 to April 30, 2022,
(y) the Company’s filing of a proxy statement to April 30, 2022 and (z) the Company holding a stockholder meeting and obtaining
a stockholder vote to June 4, 2022 or July 4, 2022 in the event that the Company receives comments from the SEC with respect to the proxy
statement; and (iii) to waive any adjustments to convertible securities or options as a result of the Adjusted Conversion Price (as defined
in the Amendment Agreement).
The Company accounted for the amendment as a modification of debt and as a result, extended the amortization
of the deferred financing fees of the original note over the remaining term of the amended agreement. In addition, the Company recorded
additional deferred financing fees as a result of the issuance of
1,000,000
shares of common stock with a per share value of $ 2.18

Operating
Leases

Legal
Contingencies
The
Company is involved in claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business, some of which seek monetary damages, including claims
for punitive damages, which are not covered by insurance. For certain pending matters, accruals have not been established because such
matters have not progressed sufficiently through discovery, and/or development of important factual information and legal information
is insufficient to enable the Company to estimate a range of possible loss, if any. An adverse determination in one or more of these
pending matters could have an adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
We
are, and may in the future become, subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business.

the date of grant.

Net
Earnings or Loss per Share
Basic
net (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of vested common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number vested of common
shares, plus the net impact of common shares (computed using the treasury stock method), if dilutive, resulting from the exercise of
dilutive securities. In periods when losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock
equivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company excluded the common stock equivalents
summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to ultimately acquire shares of common stock, from its calculation of earnings per
share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The potential dilution from common stock equivalents is computed using
the treasury stock method based on the average market value of our common stock during the period.
For the period three months ending June 30, 2022,
due to a reported net gain of $ 145,928,165 ,
the calculation of our diluted weighted-average common
shares outstanding
includes
all common stock equivalents as the effect would be
dilutive . For the period six months ending
June 30, 2022, due to a reported net loss of $ 227,019,793 ,
the calculation of our diluted weighted-average
common shares outstanding
excludes
all common stock equivalents as the effect would be
anti-dilutive .

Subsequent Events
July
6, 2022 Alternative Exercise of Hudson Bay Warrants and Cash Payment and Postponement of Annual Meeting
On
June 30, 2022, the Company postponed its special stockholder meeting from July 1, 2022 to July 26, 2022 which was subsequently postponed
again to August 23, 2022 and then postponed indefinitely. This meeting was to be held to approve various proposals including amending
the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of its authorized shares of common stock from
250,000,000
to
750,000,000 . The postponement of the meeting triggered an alternative exercise notice clause in the Company’s November
and December 2021 warrants, as amended, which allows the holder to put the warrants back to the Company in exchange for cash payments
of $ 0.65
and $ 0.36
per warrant for the November and December 2021 warrants, respectively. The Holder exercised this provision in July 2022
resulting in a cash payment of $ 33,886,612
and cancelation of
82,260,699
warrants. Additionally, per the terms of the amended July 2021
convertible note the Company made a cash payment of $ 33,000,000 .
On August 18,
2022, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement, in which it agreed to repurchase $ 55,000,000
of the principal amount of the
note then outstanding for $ 65,000,000 . The Company was permitted to release up to $ 70,000,000
from
Restricted
Cash, provided that $ 65,000,000
of the amount was wired directly from the Control Account to the Holder of the note as
payment.
Business
Changes
On July 22, 2022, the Company entered into one of
two anticipate software license agreements with its strategic partner, AI-Pros Inc. (“AI-Pros”). The license provides Vinco
the right to use AI-Pros’ tools and technologies, which could allow Vinco to participate in a social media platform that it believes
can significantly enhance its position in the digital advertising markets.
The Company is in the process of terminating the software licensing agreements with AI-Pros.
Litigation
and Management Changes
On August 5, 2022, Vinco Ventures, Inc. was
subject to a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) filed in the State of Nevada. The TRO outlined various management
disputes between existing members of the Board of Directors and members of executive management. On September 28, 2022, the Company
entered into a settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) with respect to the litigation entitled “Vinco Ventures,
Inc. v. Theodore Farnsworth, Lisa King, Roderick Vanderbilt and Erik Noble” in the Eight Judicial District Court located in
Clark County, Nevada. The Agreement set forth the following, among other things (a) Ross Miller is the interim sole CEO and shall
run the Company under the oversight of the Company’s Board of Directors, with Lisa King and Rod Vanderbilt remaining as
directors, (b) John Colucci, former Co-CEO and Phillip Jones, former CFO, both resigned effective immediately as officers and
director (in the case of Colucci) of the Company, (c) Michael Distasio and Elliot Goldstein resigned effective immediately as
Directors of the Company, (e) John Colucci received three month’s severance and Phillip Jones received four month’s
severance, in addition to any accrued and unpaid payroll, (f) The Company shall pay six months’ worth of COBRA payments for
Jones, (g) All directors are to be paid all director fees due to the date of severance, (h) Elliot Goldstein is to be paid $ 100,000
in
lieu to any matters related to his stock options and RSUs, (i) All outgoing directors and officers entered into three year
noncompete agreements with the Company, and (j) All parties entered into mutual releases with the Company.
On October 26,
2022, the Company entered into an engagement agreement with Ankura Consulting Group for interim CFO services, with Brendan Bosack, one
of its principals, named as Interim CFO of the Company. The agreement calls for services to be rendered at $ 900
per hour up to $ 30,000
per week. The agreement is for an indefinite term and cancellable by either party.
Effective December 12, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously
approved the following:
●
Ross Miller no longer as interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Gabe Hunterton no longer as interim President of the Company
●
Appointment of its Chairman, Rod Vanderbilt, as Executive Chairman as replacement for Mr. Miller and Mr. Hunterton
From the date of court appointment, August 19, 2022
through December 12, 2022, executive compensation paid to Ross Miller, interim Chief Executive Officer totaled $ 210,000 ; executive compensation
paid to Gabe Hunterton totaled $ 135,000 , and disbursements totaling $ 163,525
were made to advisors to Ross Miller.
Impairment Charges
Subsequent to June 30,
2022, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred due various management disputes between existing members of the Board
of Directors and members of executive management and the receipt of an
Alternative Exercise from
Hudson Bay , and Amendment to the July 2021
Note . Taken in conjunction with the resulting
Going Concern, the Company abandoned its product business .
Our
consumer products business was led by Edison Nation. Edison Nation had a number of internally developed brands (“EN Brands”).
These EN Brands included Cloud B, Pirasta, Uber Mom, Lily and Grey, Trillion Trees, and Barkley Lane. We impaired the related intangible
assets in the third quarter, which included customer relationships, developed technology, membership network and trademarks of $ 3,747,349
(net of amortization) and goodwill of $ 4,938,674
associated with this business.
In addition, with the
spinoff of Cryptyde, there was a change in how the Company planned to utilize the EVNT platform from its acquisition. Management
made the determination that it was no longer interested in continuing to operate and profit from E-NFT. The
developed technology intangible asset for the EVNT platform of $ 6,607,989
(net of amortization) was fully impaired at September 30,
2022.
Further we performed a quantitative impairment
test for both the remaining goodwill and intangible assets of the remaining business, Lomotif and AdRizer and recorded an estimated
impairment charge of $ 96,901,960
and $ 16,546,760
respectively
in the third quarter.

10
shares

million
common shares of ZVV Media Partners, for which issuance will be subject to Nasdaq rules) and for which a Certificate of Designation

Vinco Ventures, Inc. shall issue the Purchase Equity to ZASH Global Media at the Closing (as defined herein) or such later time as
agreed by the Parties in writing.
Nasdaq
On August 26,
2022, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K in which it disclosed that it had received notification from Nasdaq that required
the Company to submit to Nasdaq, on or before October 17, 2022, a Plan of Compliance with regard to the filing of its Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2022. The Plan of Compliance was submitted as of October 17, 2022. This 10-Q and the subsequent
third quarter 10-Q satisfy the Plan.
As a result of a delinquency
notice received with respect to the Company’s as yet filed 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company submitted a plan
of compliance to file the second quarter 10-Q and the third quarter 10-Q no later than February 13, 2023. The Company submitted an update
to this plan of compliance to Nasdaq confirming the above referenced timetable. The Company was unable to file the Form 10-Q for period ending September 30, 2022 by February 13, 2023.
On November 17, 2022, the
Company received a notice (the “November Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC
(“Nasdaq”) advising the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements under the
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (“Rule 5250”) as a result of the Company’s failure to file its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 (“Form 10-Q”) with the United States SEC in a timely manner, which deadline
was November 14, 2022. Rule 5250 requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic reports with the SEC.
On December
1, 2022, the Company received a notice (“December Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq advising the
Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements under the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (“Rule
5550”) as a result of requiring listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. Based upon the closing bid price
for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer meets this requirement. However, Rule 5550 also provides the Company
a compliance period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance. If at any time during this 180 day period the closing bid price
of the Company’s security is at least $1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written confirmation
of compliance and this matter will be closed.
On
February 14, 2023, the Company received a Staff Determination letter (the “Letter”) from Nasdaq. The Letter states that on
August 19 and November 17, 2022, Staff notified the Company that it did not comply with Nasdaq’s filing requirements set forth
in Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Rule”) because it had not filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2022, and its
Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2022 (the “Delinquent Filings”). Staff granted the Company an exception until
January 31, 2023, to regain compliance with the Rule. Subsequently, on January 26, 2023, the Company requested additional time to file
the Delinquent Filings and Staff granted the Company an exception until February 13, 2023, to regain compliance with the Rule.
Upon further review,
Staff determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the exception because it had not filed the Delinquent Filings by February
13, 2023. The Company will appeal Staff’s determination to a Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), pursuant to the procedures
set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series. A hearing request will stay the suspension of the Company’s securities and the
filing of the Form 25-NSE pending the Panel’s decision. The Company filed a hearing request and remitted the hearing filing fee
prior to February 17, 2023.

Overview
Vinco
Ventures is Focused on Digital Media, Advertising and Content Technologies
Vinco
Ventures, formerly known as Edison Nation, Inc., Xspand P roducts
Lab, Inc. and Idea Lab Products, Inc., is a Nevada corporation incorporated on July 18, 2017. In connection with the acquisition of an
80% equity interest in Lomotif by ZVV, our joint venture with ZASH in 2021, our recent acquisition of AdRizer which includes 50% of Mind
Tank, our investments into entertainment and motion picture company PZAJ, and our strategic investments in the TMX and Magnifi U platforms,
we are transitioning from focusing on innovation, development and commercialization of end-to-end consumer products to the creation of
a content-centric ecosystem with an emphasis on innovation, content development and commercialization of print and digital media, advertising,
and distribution platforms. Additionally, with a focus on profitability, future mergers and acquisitions will be considered if they enhance
the full ecosystem, provide more exclusive content, and create unique
experiences
for our active users. We currently operate the platforms and businesses described below through our significant subsidiaries and consolidated
variable interest entities:
● Lomotif
Social Media
Platform
Lomotif
and the Lomotif App
- ZVV currently owns an 80% equity interest in Lomotif, a Singapore-based video-sharing and live streaming social
networking platform that is committed to democratizing video creation and increasing user reach through our content development, live
streaming and cross-platform engagement initiatives. The Lomotif app allows its users to create their own music videos by selecting pictures
and videos from the camera, mixing them with music and transforming video clips into music videos. Lomotif users can watch videos of
other creators on the Lomotif platform and share their videos on the Lomotif platform or on various third-party social media platforms
such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Twitch. The Lomotif platform offers LoMoTV, a digital entertainment and lifestyle content network
offering original programming. Our strategy includes expanding Lomotif’s reach through our live-streaming entertainment initiatives
involving social media influencers and leading artists and entertainers.
32
The
Lomotif app is available in the Apple and Google stores and is a grassroots social community with dedicated users spanning from Asia,
South America, to the United States. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, Lomotif has not generated significant revenue and we are
developing means to monetize the content creation and streaming capabilities of the Lomotif platform including our plan to leverage the
AdRizer technologies to enable advertisers to more effectively engage with the Lomotif platform, content and its
users.
As of June 30,
2022, there has been a downward trend in the number of monthly active users and daily active users of the Lomotif technology as a result
of the following reasons:
● Overall
drop in MAU, DAU and creations is in part due to an update requirement by the Apple Appstore.
The update has limited Lomotif’s music library. This muted much of the content.
● Moderation
of explicit content.
● New
Apple privacy features limit apps abilities to track users, which in turn may limit recommendations
and ad revenue.
● With
a focus on bugs and fixes and to integrate advertising placement in the app and on the website,
Lomotif did not introduce a steady stream of new features, thus potentially impacting Creation,
and Retention metrics.
● Some
user acquisition tests did not yield the desired conversion rates from views to active users.
As
of June 30,2022, there has been an upward trend in the Impressions and Reach across the Lomotif website ecosystem. This cross-platform
strategy was implemented in order to test various types of content, promotions and advertising, and intended to mitigate the decline
in advertising and revenue opportunities. We believe that in 2023, this trend will continue to increase traffic on Lomotif websites by
leveraging the entire Lomotif social and website ecosystem. Lomotif measures active users on platform, as well as users on the Lomotif
website, Lomotif promotional sites, views of live events, and views of original Lomotif content shared on other social sites. Key metrics
include active users on platform, users on Lomotif sites, site visits, content views, reach and impressions. AdRizer is anticipated to
generate advertising revenue through ad placements in the Lomotif app and on Lomotif websites based on traffic, views, and impressions.
● End-to-End
Fully Integrated Programmatic Advertising
Platform
AdRizer
and the Cortex Platform – Our wholly-owned subsidiary AdRizer provides technology solutions to automate the use of artificial intelligence
for digital advertising analytics and programmatic media buying through its core platform, Cortex. Cortex provides real-time analytics
for marketing spend and revenue optimization and delivers ad- campaign creation, optimization and monetization at scale. Cortex integrates
with various traffic partners, including Google, MSN, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and others, and is able to deliver real-time attribution
against a wide range of advertiser and publisher metrics such as revenue by source, author, article, and conversion event. AdRizer targets
advertisers, advertising agencies, publishers and other advertising technology companies as its audience for the Cortex platform offerings.
AdRizer
generates revenue from the Cortex platform through two major sources: (1) the traffic acquisition of digital advertising spaces to advertisers
from multiple digital advertising technologies, and (2) developing marketing campaigns and strategies for some of the top direct-to-customers
(“DTC”) companies. We believe that AdRizer’s Cortex platform provides small- to medium-sized enterprises with an efficient
and effective end-to-end, fully integrated platform that allows its users to control their marketing and branding campaigns in real-time.
We also expect to integrate AdRizer’s technologies with the Lomotif platform and content and the Honey Badger digital commerce
company.
● Streaming
Music Non-Fungible Token (“NFT”)
Platform
E-NFT.com
– Our wholly-owned subsidiary EVNT Platform LLC,
dba
Emmersive Entertainment (“EVNT”) offers a platform
for artists and content owners to distribute their intellectual property. EVNT’s proprietary streaming process seeks to make NFTs
affordable by seeking to reduce mining fees with the goal of enabling fans to engage with content in new ways with EVNT’s multi-media
delivery system. EVNT generates revenue from the development of custom, digital artwork and digital music that is sold in the form of
non-fungible tokens through a third-party marketplace.

Company
Honey
Badger - Our wholly-owned subsidiary Honey Badger offers a full-service digital commerce strategies solution focused on brand specific
messaging and designing comprehensive digital campaigns from creation to monetization for celebrities and influencers. As a digital commerce
company, Honey Badger leverages influencer relationships and followers in their network to grow advertiser-based revenue as well as Vinco’s
brands and holdings. Honey Badger generates revenue from providing digital marketing services for brands and influencers.
Corporate
Strategy
We
are transitioning from focusing on innovation, development and commercialization of end-to-end consumer products to the creation of a
content-centric ecosystem with an emphasis on innovation, content development and commercialization of print and digital media, advertising,
and distribution platforms. Additionally, with a focus on profitability, future mergers and acquisitions will be considered if they enhance
the full ecosystem, provide more exclusive content, and create unique experiences for our active users. The right content enables brands
to rapidly communicate key messages, improving the asset’s ability to capture the attention of target audiences. Video and digital
content is also a ready-made resource for users who consume content on mobile devices. Additionally, video generates a much larger number
of shares than long-form content, text, or image posts. By investing in Lomotif, our short-form video sharing and social media platform,
AdRizer and MindTank, related growth initiatives and investments such as PZAJ, TMX and Magnifi U, we are aiming to grow into an integrated
robust social media, content development and digital advertising company, with millions of users around the world.
In
February 2022 we acquired AdRizer. We continue to integrate AdRizer’s Cortex   technologies with the Lomotif platform
and content to optimize revenue generation opportunities. We have also invested in activities to generate content for the Lomotif platform
and to expand its user base and engagement such as launching LoMoTV, hosting and live streaming concerts and celebrity events. We expect
to further this effort by continuing to invest in acquisitions, joint ventures, and growing our own capacity to create and distribute
content. For example, we expect that future joint ventures, licensing, loan financing or other arrangements with ZASH and PZAJ Holdings,
LLC will generate entertainment content that we plan to distribute through the Lomotif platform, among other distribution channels.
In
connection with our transition, we have completed the process of spinning off Cryptyde.
Recent
Developments
The
following is a description of recent events regarding important developments which we believe are important to an understanding of our
business, financial position and results of operations.
Acquisition
of
AdRizer
On
October 1, 2021, ZVV and ZASH and AdRizer entered into a Letter of Intent (as amended,
“LOI”) for ZASH or ZVV to acquire
all the outstanding equity interests of
AdRizer.
On
February 11, 2022, Vinco Ventures, ZASH and ZVV entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, whereby ZASH and ZVV assigned to
Vinco Ventures, and Vinco Ventures assumed, all of the rights and obligations of ZASH and ZVV under the LOI, in consideration of a cash
payment by Vinco Ventures to ZASH of $6.75 million upon the closing of the acquisition.
34
On February 11, 2022, Vinco Ventures, AdRizer, the
members of AdRizer and the holders of performance units (“Performance Units”) of AdRizer under its phantom equity plan (collectively,
“Seller Members”), and Innovative Assets LLC, in its capacity as the sellers’ representative, entered into and consummated
the transactions contemplated by a definitive Unit Purchase Agreement (“AdRizer Purchase Agreement”), whereby the Company
acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of AdRizer (“Purchased Interests”) from the Seller Members and canceled the
Performance Units, resulting in AdRizer becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price paid and payable to the
Seller Members for the Purchased Interests and in consideration of the cancellation of the Performance Units consists of (i) $38 million
in cash paid at closing, of which $10 million was deposited in an escrow account to secure the Seller Members’ indemnification obligations
under the AdRizer Purchase Agreement, subject to customary post-closing adjustments for working capital and other items, and (ii) up to
10 million shares of the Company’s common stock to be issued on January 1, 2024 (“Buyer Share Issuance Date”), determined
by dividing $50 million by the volume weighted average price of the Company’s common stock reported by Bloomberg LP for the 20 trading
days preceding such date, subject to a floor price of $5.00 and maximum price of $8.00 per share (“Purchase Price Equity”).
Pursuant to the AdRizer Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a resale registration statement on form S-1 or S-3 no later
than 90 days prior to the Buyer Share Issuance Date if permitted by the SEC, and otherwise no later than 5 business days after the Buyer
Share Issuance Date, to register the resale of the Purchase Price Equity and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration
statement to become effective as soon as practicable after filing. In addition, the Company has agreed to furnish AdRizer with working
capital in the amount of $1 million by each 3-month anniversary of the closing date until the Company has furnished AdRizer with a total
of $5 million in working
capital.
Upon
the closing of the acquisition, AdRizer entered into a new employment agreement with its chief executive officer, Kenneth Bond. Certain
Seller Members including those who are employees, officers, directors or managers of AdRizer and their affiliates also agreed to be bound
by three-year post-closing non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.
Spin-Off
of Cryptyde,
Inc .
On
November 8, 2021, our subsidiary Cryptyde initially filed, and on January 25, 2022, March 18, 2022 and May 13, 2022 amended, a Form 10
registration statement with the SEC (“Form 10”) in connection with our planned spin-off of Cryptyde, subject to certain
conditions as described in the registration statement, including the effectiveness of the registration statement, receipt of an opinion
of counsel to the effect that, among other things, the spin-off and related transactions should qualify as tax-free for United States
federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, and Nasdaq having approved the listing
of Cryptyde’s common stock. Cryptyde holds our packaging, Bitcoin mining services, and Web3 (decentralized internet) products businesses.
On
May 16, 2022, the Form 10 was declared effective. The record date for the spin-off was May 18, 2022. Effective June 29, 2022, Cryptyde
separated from the Company and the distribution of its common stock was completed. Upon completion of the spin-off, Cryptyde became an
independent, publicly traded company (NasdaqCM: TYDE). The distribution was made in the amount of one share of Cryptyde common stock for every ten shares of our common
stock owned by our stockholders at the close of business on the Record Date.
Also, in connection with the spinoff, we entered into
definitive agreements with Cryptyde that, among other things, set forth the terms and conditions of the separation and distribution. The
agreements set forth the principles and actions taken or to be taken in connection with the separation and the distribution and provide
a framework for our relationship with Cryptyde from and after the separation and the distribution. The agreements include a Separation
and Distribution Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement.
The results of our Cryptyde businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in the current year period
through the date of the spinoff and in the prior year period.
35
Closing
of Cryptyde
Financing
On January 26, 2022, Cryptyde entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement (“Note Securities Purchase Agreement”) with an accredited investor (“Note
Investor”) for the issuance of a (i) 1,500,000 shares of Cryptyde Common Stock, and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to
1,500,000 shares of Cryptyde Common Stock with an exercise price of $8.00 per share of Cryptyde Common Stock. In
addition, Cryptyde issued a warrant to the placement agent to purchase up to 240,000 shares of Cryptyde Common Stock with
an initial exercise price of $8.00 per share of Cryptyde Common Stock. The transaction closed on May 20, 2022. The
consideration paid to Cryptyde was $12,000,000 and was reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interest of the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.
On June 29, 2022, Vinco Ventures,
Inc. distributed 100% of the shares of Cryptyde’s common stock held by Vinco to holders of shares of Vinco common stock, subject
to certain conditions. On the Distribution Date, each holder of Vinco common stock received one share of Cryptyde common stock for every
ten shares of Vinco common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date.
Love is Blurred, LLC
The purpose of Love is Blurred, LLC (“LIB LLC”)
was to produce audiovisual content for ZASH’s business. Consistent with this purpose, the LIB LLC held the rights to “Love
Is Blurred,” a TV reality show in production to be distributed via cable television syndication while also streaming exclusively
on Lomotif. No related revenue streams to date as the production is still in development.
The LIB LLC assets consist principally of a single
film production asset. Because the LIB LLC is not a business, the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset.
The purchase price was $1,250,000 by which the Company
paid ZASH the $1,250,000 purchase price by reducing the outstanding balance on a loan between the Company and ZASH. The acquisition closed
on June 21, 2022.

On March 9, 2022, the Company, Cryptyde and the noteholder
of the Senior Secured Convertible Note issued by the Company on July 22, 2021 (“July 2021 Note”) entered into an Amendment
Agreement (“Amendment Agreement”) whereby the parties agreed to, among other things: (i) amend certain provisions of the July

of the Adjusted Conversion Price (as defined in the Amendment Agreement).

whereby the parties agreed to amend the First Amendment Agreement to replace the date of “April 30, 2022” in Section 7(m)
of the First Amendment Agreement to “May 6, 2022.”
On
May 6, 2022, the Company and the Holder entered into a Third Amendment Agreement (“Third Amendment Agreement”) whereby
the parties agreed to amend the Second Amendment Agreement to replace the date of “May 6, 2022” in Section 7(m) of the Second
Amendment Agreement to “May 11, 2022.”
Warrant
Exercise and
Issuance
For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the
Company issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock related to the Warrant Exercise Agreement dated
December 20, 2021, with a warrant holder, in which the Company agreed to issue 225% of the number of Exercised Warrant Shares at an
exercise price of $3.265 to the warrant holder for every warrant the warrant holder exercised from the period commencing December
20, 2021 and ending on February 28, 2022. In conjunction with this agreement, the warrant holder exercised 98,324,692 warrants in
the first six months of 2022 which generated $101,081,926 in gross proceeds to the Company during the six months ended June 30,
2022. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, warrant shares of 61,430,123 were exercised and did not receive any proceeds.
In conjunction with the agreement, the Company issued 83,012,781 warrants to the holder and 6,641,022 to the placement agent
for the agreement. The warrants have an exercise price of $3.265, a five year term, and provide registration rights to the holder
along with other terms that cause the warrants to qualify for liability treatment. The initial fair value of the warrants issued
during the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $243,681,478. (see
Note 12 — Warrant Liability )

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
Estimates
Our
management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or
GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. The accounting estimates that require our most significant,
difficult and subjective judgments have an impact on revenue recognition, the determination of share-based compensation, financial
instruments, liabilities associated with the Company’s outstanding warrants,
business combinations, and asset acquisitions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.
There
have been no changes in such policies or the application of such policies during the six months ended June 30, 2022 except as
follows:
Significant Accounting Policies
Significant accounting policies are disclosed in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no changes in such policies or the application
of such policies during the six months ended June 30, 2022. As a result of the acquisition of Adrizer, the Company added a new revenue
stream, Digital Media Advertising and Licensing, to its Revenue Recognition policy. Additionally, as a result of the Company’s interest
in Love is Blurred, the Company has recorded Film and Television Production assets in accordance with Topic 926. As a result of these
changes in the first six months of 2022, new Investments have been recognized. The details for each of these topics are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
The Company considers all revenues as arising from
contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized based on the five-step process outlined in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
606 as disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional clarification on the Company’s Digital Media Advertising
and Licensing revenue recognition policy is provided below.
Digital Media Advertising and Licensing
The Company’s digital media advertising revenues
are generated primarily from the posting of original digital content through third-party online platforms which are then delivered to
users of the online platform across the customer’s digital advertising platform and becomes monetizable to the Company, which the
Company concludes is its performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the services are transferred to customers
and the transaction price is determined by the third-party online platform. Revenue from the digital media platform is primarily recognized
based on impressions delivered to customers. An “impression” is delivered when an advertisement appears on pages viewed by
users. For impressions-based digital advertising, revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered over the term of the arrangement,
while revenue from non-impressions-based digital advertising is recognized over the period that the advertisements are displayed. Such
amounts are recognized net of agency commissions and provisions for estimated sales incentives, including rebates, rate adjustments or
discounts.
Licensing revenues are derived from the sale of a
licensee’s products that incorporates the Company’s intellectual property. Royalty revenues are recognized during the quarter
in which the Company receives a report from the licensee detailing the shipment of products that incorporate the Company’s intellectual
property, which receipt is in the quarter following the licensee’s sale of such products to its customers. Royalties are calculated
as a percentage of the revenues received by the Company’s licensees on sales of products incorporating the Company’s intellectual
property.
39
Identification of a Customer and Gross versus Net
Revenue Recognition
In the normal course of business,
the Company acts as or uses an intermediary or agent in executing transactions with third parties. When the intermediary or agent is determined
to be the Company’s customer, the Company records revenue based on the amount it expects to receive from the agent or intermediary.
In other circumstances, the determination of whether
revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether the Company is acting as the principal or an agent
in the transaction. If the Company is acting as a principal in a transaction, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis. If the Company
is acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company reports revenue on a net basis. The determination of whether the Company is acting
as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of the terms of the arrangement. The Company
serves as the principal in transactions in which it controls the goods or services prior to being transferred to the ultimate customer.
For AdRizer, FASB ASC 606 requires an entity to determine
whether it is a principal (recognizes revenue at the gross amount) or an agent (recognizes revenue at the net amount) for each promised
good or service. Based on the FASB guidance, the Company has determined that AdRizer is the principal for each promised good or service,
thus, revenue is recognized at the gross amount of the transactions. Revenue from traffic sales and traffic management services are generally
recognized at the end of each month when the performance obligation is satisfied.
Film and Television Productions
The Company accounts for the film and television productions
in accordance with Topic 926,
Entertainment – Films . Production costs qualifying for capitalization, are recorded as film
and television productions on the consolidated balance sheet and amortized using forecast methods that match amortization to estimated
revenue. Currently all productions are actively under development and, as such, amortization has not commenced.
Investments
Investments in equity securities (excluding equity
method investments) with readily determinable fair values are accounted for at fair value. For investments in equity securities without
readily determinable fair values, the Company elects the measurement alternative permitted under GAAP to measure these investments at
cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer.
Investments in which the Company has the ability to
exercise significant influence but does not control and is not the primary beneficiary are equity method investments. Significant influence
typically exists if the Company has a 20% to 50% ownership interest in a venture unless persuasive evidence to the contrary exists. Under
this method of accounting, the Company records its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of equity method investees and a
corresponding increase or decrease to the investment balances. Cash payments to equity method investees such as additional investments,
loans and advances and expenses incurred on behalf of investees as well as payments from equity method investees such as dividends, distributions
and repayments of loans and advances are recorded as adjustments to investment balances. The Company applies the cumulative earnings approach
for determining the cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investees. Distributions received are included
in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities, unless the cumulative distributions exceed the Company’s portion
of the cumulative equity in the net earnings of the equity method investment, in which case the excess distributions are deemed to be
returns of the investment and are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company evaluates
its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments
may not be recoverable.

Revenue
For the three months ended June 30, 2022, revenues
from continuing operations increased by $9,680,183 or 1412.92%, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was
due to the impact of the Company’s acquisition of AdRizer in February 2022, which generated $10,113,000 of revenue for the Company
during the second quarter of 2022. AdRizer’s revenue consists of digital advertising sales and services to advertisers. Revenues
of the Company’s Cryptyde subsidiary of approximately $3,758,000 were excluded from these amounts since the Company spun-off its
ownership in Cryptyde on June 29, 2022.
Cost
of
Revenues
For the three months ended June 30, 2022, cost of
revenues from continuing operations increased by $10,629,467 or 3354.20%, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase
was due to the costs of traffic acquisition and content creation at AdRizer. Cost of revenues of the Company’s Cryptyde subsidiary
of approximately $6,310,000 were excluded from these amounts since the Company spun-off its ownership in Cryptyde on June 29, 2022.
Gross
Profit
For the three months ended June 30, 2022, gross profit
decreased by $949,283, or -257.81%, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease reflected the impact of the Company’s
new business lines of digital media and advertising from AdRizer, traffic acquisition and content creation costs of which were higher
than expected as that business recently began its operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

(“SGA costs”) were $31,546,389 in the three months ending June 30, 2022 as compared to $5,410,232 in the three months
ending June 30, 2021, an increase of $26,136,157. This large increase was due to a significant expansion of the Company’s
activities requiring SGA costs as it transitioned into a digital media and entertainment company in 2022. In addition, the increase
in SGA costs reflects the impact of costs associated with the Company’s newly acquired subsidiary AdRizer, which was acquired
in February 2022. The largest increase was due to the increase in advertising, marketing and promotions cost during the second
quarter of 2022, which included the costs the Company spent on its promotions and live-streaming of the Electronic Daisy Carnival
music event in Las Vegas in May. In addition, the Company saw large increases in legal and professional fees and compensation costs
in both periods as compared to the 2021 periods, as the overall size and scope of the business has increased significantly since
2021, primarily due to the additions of Lomotif and AdRizer since the 2021 periods.

Interest expense was approximately $16,108,000 for
the three months ended June 30, 2022 versus approximately $2,650,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in interest
expense was related to the amortization of financing fees of the convertible note issued to Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd. (“Hudson
Bay”) in July 2021.
Loss
on issuances of warrants and change in fair value of warrant
liability
The
Company classifies a warrant to purchase shares of its common stock as a liability on its consolidated balance sheets as such warrant
is a free-standing financial instrument that may require the Company to transfer consideration upon exercise. Each warrant is initially
recorded at fair value on date of grant using the Monte-Carlo simulation pricing model and subsequently re-measured to fair
value at each subsequent balance sheet date. Changes in fair value of the warrant are recognized as a component of other income (expense),
net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes
in fair value until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the warrant.
For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company
had no losses from issuance of warrants as compared to a loss of $133,699,181 during the three months ended June 30, 2021. A loss on issuance
of warrants was recorded in the first quarter of 2022 only. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company had a loss of $243,681,478
as compared to a loss of $208,855,715 during the six months ended June 30, 2021.

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company
had net income from continuing operations of $147,939,736 as compared to a net loss of $178,922,680 during the three months ended June
30, 2021, an increase of $326,862,416 or 182.7%. The significant change from a net loss to a net income for the two periods was primarily
triggered by the impact of the Company’s requirement to recognize the fair value of warrants that the Company issued and the change
in fair values of exercised and outstanding warrants during each reporting period. The total impact of warrant liability accounting during
the three months ended June 30, 2022 was a net other income of $173,059,037 as compared to a net other expense of $330,630,336 in the
same three months of 2021. The warrant liability amounts are affected by the fair value of the Company’s stock which is the market
price of the Company’s common stock as traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. During the first six months of 2022, the Company’s
stock price ranged from a low of $1.34 and a high of $5.19 per share, which had significant impact on the fair market value of the Company’s
warrants on their grant and exercise dates. The other expense due to warrant liability constituted 65% of the Company’s net loss
for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 126% of the Company’s net income for the three months ended June 30, 2022.

SGA costs from continuing operations increased significantly
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due to a significant expansion
of the Company’s activities requiring SGA costs as it transitioned into a digital media and entertainment company in 2022. In addition,
the increase in SGA costs reflect the impact of costs associated with the Company’s newly acquired subsidiary AdRizer, which was
acquired in February 2022. Total SGA costs from continuing operations were $31,546,389 in the three months ending June 30, 2022 as compared
to $5,410,232 in the three months ending June 30, 2021, an increase of $26,136,157. Total SGA costs from continuing operations were $55,588,027
in the six months ending June 30, 2022, as compared to $16,692,058 in the six months ending June 30, 2021. The largest increase was due
to the increase in advertising, marketing and promotions cost during the second quarter of 2022, which included the costs the Company
spent on its promotions and live-streaming of the Electronic Daisy Carnival music event in Las Vegas in May. In addition, the Company
saw large increases in legal and professional fees and compensation costs in both periods as compared to the 2021 periods, as the overall
size and scope of the business has increased significantly since 2021, primarily due to the additions of Lomotif and AdRizer since the
2021 periods.

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company
had a net loss from continuing operations of $223,758,881 as compared to a net loss of $241,367,534 during the six months ended June 30,
2021, an increase of $17,608,653 or 7.3%. The change for the two periods was primarily triggered by the impact of the Company’s
acquisition of Lomotif. On July 25, 2021, ZVV, a joint venture of the Company and ZASH, completed the acquisition of 80% of the outstanding
equity interests of Lomotif for a total purchase price of $109,765,000. The Company, therefore, has a 40% ownership interest in Lomotif.
As the transaction occurred subsequent to June 30, 2021, the impact of noncontrolling interests on the net loss from continuing operations
was minimal. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company had a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $18,690,055
as compared to a net income of $50,577 attributable to noncontrolling interests during the six months ended June 30, 2021.

As discussed above, the Company incurred significant
losses during the first six months of 2022, and has a history of losses since inception. Since 2021, a significant percentage of its losses
has been driven by non-cash expenses items, especially losses caused by liability accounting for its investor warrants. The Company used
approximately $72 million in cash for operations during the first six months of 2022. This amount included approximately $8.2 million
for transaction related costs associated with its acquisition of AdRizer in February 2022, and a $10 million payment of accrued registration
rights penalties owed to Hudson Bay. This amount also included significant investments in sales, marketing and promotional activities
which the Company engaged in during the first quarter to drive awareness and interest in the Lomotif application and Lomotif branded websites,
especially for events livestreamed on the Lomotif platform. During the first six months of the year, the Company live streamed and promoted
the Shaq Fun House event in January, the Okeechobee Music Festival in February, and the Electronic Daisy Carnival (“EDC”)
in May. These expenses were intended to create traffic and interactions with the Lomotif digital properties with the goal of generating
advertising revenue opportunities utilizing the capabilities of AdRizer, which the Company expects will reduce its operating cash needs
during the rest of 2022. To date, these efforts have not led to any meaningful revenue and there is no guarantee that the Company will
successfully do so. If additional advertising revenues are not generated as quickly, or in sufficient amount, the Company will need to
utilize its unrestricted cash on hand to fund its operations.
49
As
a result of the Company’s repayments to Hudson Bay (see Note 17 - Subsequent Events) and a lack of issuable stock, it has been unable
to raise significant proceeds with which to increase its liquidity. As it looks forward into early 2023, it now has preferred shares
authorized with which to begin the capital raising process, should market conditions permit.
Furthermore,
the Company may determine it is in the best interests of the Company to pursue additional investments, acquisitions, or funding of marketing
and promotional efforts as the Company expands its presence and capabilities within the digital media marketplace. To do so, the Company
may require additional cash resources that the Company could generate through the sale of common stock, the exercise of outstanding warrants,
and the issuance of convertible debt, each of which the Company has utilized to raise capital since 2021. As of the date of this report,
the Company’s ability to raise additional capital is restricted by its lack of available, authorized but not outstanding common
shares. The Company is currently seeking authorization from its shareholders to increase the number of shares it is authorized to issue
under its Articles of Incorporation, but has not received the requisite vote needed to pass the proposal. Therefore, as discussed in Note
1 to the Company’s financial statements attached herein, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern and meet its obligations through twelve months following the date the condensed consolidated financial
statements are issued. As a result, until the Company is able to raise additional capital, the Company has begun implement steps to conserve
its unrestricted cash on hand and address any going concern issues, including but not limited to the following steps:
● Reduce
headcount,
● Reduce
marketing, promotional and content development and production
activities,
● Evaluate
the sales of assets or
subsidiaries.

The
Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting
Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period covered

information that it is required to disclose in reports that the Company files with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the Exchange Act rules and regulations.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our
principal executive officer, we have completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
on the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework. Based on this evaluation under the COSO framework, management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2022.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
However, these inherent limitations are known features
of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this
risk.
As of December 31, 2021, and June 30, 2022, management
completed an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the COSO framework. Management has concluded
that as of December 31, 2021, and June 30,2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to detect the inappropriate
application of GAAP. Management identified the following material weakness set forth below in our internal control over financial reporting.
The Company was unable to provide a timely financial
reporting package in connection with its December 31, 2021 Form 10-K year end audit. This was primarily the result of the Company’s
limited accounting personnel. This also limits the extent to which the Company can segregate incompatible duties and has a lack of controls
in place to ensure that all material transaction s, related
party transactions, and developments or significant unusual transactions impacting the financial statements are reflected. There is a
risk under the current circumstances that intentional or unintentional errors could occur and not be detected.
Subsequent
to December 31, 2021, the Company was unable to provide timely financing reporting packages for periods ending June 30, 2022 and September
30, 2022 Form 10-Q. The Company was subject to circumstances which included:
●
On
July 21, 2022, the Board duly appointed John Colucci as interim co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company and ratified the appointment
of Theodore Farnsworth as co-Chief Executive Officer to serve together with Mr. Colucci in lieu of Lisa King in such capacity. Mr.
Farnsworth’s appointment as co-Chief Executive Officer was previously reported in a Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 14,
2022. [Prior to Mr. Colucci’s appointment as interim co-Chief Executive Officer and prior to his appointment as a director,
Mr. Colucci had been determined by the Board to be an independent director within the meaning of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2).]
The board unanimously agreed to replace the vacant independent board seat with a qualified independent director within the next 30
days.
●
As
a result of the appointment of John Colucci as interim co-Chief Executive Officer the Company was found to be not in compliance with
the Nasdaq continued listing requirements that the Board be comprised of a majority of independent directors and that the audit committee
of the Board be comprised of at least three independent directors. On July 22, 2022, the Company was notified by Nasdaq of the foregoing
noncompliance. The Company and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board commenced a search for an additional
independent director to replace Mr. Colucci as a director and enable the Company to cure such noncompliance as soon as practicable.
51
●
Based
on the discovery of the lack of disclosure of 3rd-party related transactions and information that brought into question whether Mr.
Colucci met the requirements of independence for NASDAQ listing when he became an independent director, the company hired independent
counsel to determine whether Mr. Colucci met these requirements. The Chairman recommended to the board that Mr. Colucci step down
immediately as an independent director for the next sixty days until the determination of whether independence was met.
●
On
August 3, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit against each of Ted Farnsworth, Lisa King, Rod Vanderbilt and Erik Noble, alleging four
causes of action, including: (i) breach of fiduciary duty, (ii) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) civil conspiracy
and (iv) declaratory and injunctive relief in the event that no other legal remedy is available to the Company.
●
On
September 28, 2022, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the litigation, in which it appointed Ross Miller
the sole CEO of the Company. John Colucci and Phillip Jones, former CFO, both resigned effectively immediately as executives of the
Company. Michael DiStasio and Elliot Goldstein resigned effective immediately as Directors of the Company. No CFO was immediately
appointed following Mr. Jones’ resignation.
●
On
October 26, 2022, Brendan Bosack was appointed interim CFO of the Company.
●
On
November 11, 2022, the management of the Company executed a reduction-in-force plan to reduce operating costs and better align its
workforce expenses with the needs of its business. Under this Plan, the Company reduced its workforce by 39 employees (approximately
65%).
These
circumstances may have impacted our internal control over financial reporting which may include additional material weaknesses such as:
(a) the absence of controls designed to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of accounting
transactions; (b) lack of written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures (c) insufficient segregation of duties
within accounting functions and (d) inadequacy of the number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance
and accounting.
In addition, in June 2022, the Company was a victim
of an email spoofing attack where the intruder was able to obtain access to the Company’s email system and send emails internally
that had fake invoices that were presented and appeared to be approved for payment in accordance with the Company’s standard wire
approval process. As a result of this email intrusion, the Company incorrectly wired funds to two vendors in error in the aggregate of
$4,010,000. Fortunately, the fraudulent wires were detected quickly, and the Company was able to recover approximately 95% of the fraudulently
wire funds.
Remediation Plan to Address Material Weaknesses in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting
Our management is committed to improving its internal
controls. Due to the nature of these material weaknesses, it is reasonably possible that misstatements which could be material to the
interim consolidated financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected during our financial close and reporting
process.
Our company plans to take steps to enhance and improve
the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have
not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to develop a comprehensive
plan and implement the changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. The plan will include: (i) appointing additional qualified
personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopting sufficient written policies
and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out are largely dependent upon our securing additional
financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts
may be adversely affected in a material manner.
We are not required by current SEC rules to include, and do not include
an auditor’s attestation report regarding our internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, our registered public accounting
firm has not attested to management’s reports on our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II
ITEM
1. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS
From
time to time, the Company is party to legal actions that are routine and incidental to its business. However, based upon available
information and in consultation with legal counsel, except as otherwise disclosed in our financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of
this Quarterly Report, management does not expect the ultimate disposition of any or a combination of these actions to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects
and\or results of operations.
ITEM
1A. RISK
FACTORS
The
below risk factors are intended to supplement and not replace, the risk factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2021. Please read these risk factors in conjunction with those set forth in the aforementioned 10-K.
The
loss of one or more of Vinco’s key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future,
could harm our business.
In
order to be successful, Vinco must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees across the Company. Hiring
and retaining qualified executives is critical to our future. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased attrition
and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations.
Vinco
may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive
with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to
develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could
adversely affect Vinco’s business and results of operations.
There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need substantial additional funding and may be unable
to raise capital when needed.
There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  If we are unable to raise funding through equity markets
as and when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. If we are
unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or
dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. Our lack of cash resources and our potential
inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and our ability to raise new capital,
enter into critical contractual relations with third parties, meet our obligations as they become due and otherwise execute our business
strategy.
Additionally,
the Company may have the inability to raise additional equity capital due to lack of authorized common stock.
53
We
are not currently in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with Nasdaq’s continued
listing requirements, our Common Stock could be delisted, which could affect the price of our Common Stock and liquidity and reduce our
ability to raise capital.
On
December 1, 2022, Vinco Ventures, Inc. received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC advising
the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements under the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)
(the “Rule”) as a result of requiring listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. Based upon the closing
bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer meets this requirement. However, the Rules also provide the
Company a compliance period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance.
On January 4, 2023, the Company received a notification
from Nasdaq that since it had not held an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal
year end ended December 31, 2021, it no longer complies with Nasdaq’s Rules for continued listing.
Under
the Rules the Company has 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance and if the plan is accepted, Nasdaq can grant an exception
of up to 180 calendar days from the fiscal year end, or until June 29, 2023, to regain compliance. The Company plans to submit a plan
which is to hold an annual meeting no later than March 31, 2023.
We
have experienced a delay of stockholder meeting and may receive alternate exercise notices from our investors.
The
Company entered into a May Exchange Agreement which requires the Company to hold a stockholder meeting no later than July 4, 2022 under
Section 7(q). As previously reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 30, 2022, the Company
postponed the Special Meeting from July 1, 2022 until July 26, 2022, in order to provide additional time for the Company’s stockholders
to consider and vote on the proposals to be acted upon at the Special Meeting.
On
July 5, 2022, the Holder submitted Alternate Exercise Notices to the Company with respect to (i) 14,500,000 exercise shares under the
November Warrants, and (ii) 67,760,699 exercise shares under the December Warrants, for an aggregate payment equal to $33,886,612 (the
“Warrant Payment”). On July 6, 2022, the Company made the Warrant Payment, in cash, to the Holder pursuant to the Alternate
Exercise Notices and, as a result, a total of 82,260,699 warrants held by the Holder were canceled.
54
We
may incur liability as a result of content published using our Platform or as a result of claims related to content generated by our
developers, creators, and users, including copyright infringement, and legislation regulating content on our Platform may require us
to change our Platform or business practices.
Our
success relies in part on the ability of Lomotif to drive engagement with content. Content creators generate content they upload to our
service, but some creators may upload content that infringes the terms and rights of third parties or violates our terms of use. If
we should fail to qualify for statutory or other legal protections that immunize us from monetary damages for intellectual property infringement,
the damages could be significant and have a material impact on our business. While we have implemented measures designed to limit our
exposure to claims of intellectual property infringement, intellectual property owners may allege that we failed to take appropriate
measures to prevent infringing activities on our systems, that we turned a blind eye to infringement, or that we facilitated, induced
or contributed to infringement.
A
number of entities who are members of the National Music Publishers Association, or NMPA, have threatened litigation against us where
they alleged that we engaged in copyright infringement by having used certain musical compositions owned or controlled by them on our
Lomotif platform without necessary licenses. We vigorously dispute and have disputed claims of infringement by such publishers but could
be subject to additional claims in the future. An adverse judgment against us in any such lawsuit could require us to settle any claims
for an undetermined amount which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
We
may also be required to enter into license agreements with various licensors, including record labels, music publishers, performing rights
organizations, and collective management organizations, to obtain licenses that authorize the storage and use of content uploaded by
our users. We may not be able to develop technological solutions to comply with these laws on economically reasonable terms and there
is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into agreements with all relevant rights holders on terms that we deem reasonable. Compliance
may therefore negatively impact our financial prospects.
We
are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential cyberattacks, security problems, or other disruption and expanding
social media vehicles present new risks.
We
rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information,
and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, billing, and operating data.
We may purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems will depend, and we rely on commercially
available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission, and storage of confidential
operator and other customer information. We depend upon the secure transmission of this information over public networks. Our
networks and storage applications could be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or others through cyberattacks, which are
rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means, or may be breached due to operator error, malfeasance
or other system disruptions. In fact, in June 2022, the Company was a victim of an email spoofing attack where the intruder was able
to obtain access to the Company’s email system and send emails internally that had fake invoices that were presented and
appeared to be approved for payment in accordance with the Company’s standard wire approval process. As a result of this email
intrusion, the Company incorrectly wired funds to two vendors in error in the aggregate of $4,010,000. Fortunately, the fraudulent
wires were detected quickly, and the Company was able to recover approximately 95% of the fraudulently wired funds. In some cases,
it will be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. Any significant breakdown,
invasion, destruction, interruption, or leakage of information from our systems could harm our reputation and business.
55
Hostile
takeover attempt and subsequent litigation.
Prior
to filing of this second quarter report, which was submitted within the agreed upon compliance plan agree to with Nasdaq, but substantially
delayed, the Company was engaged in litigation in Q3 due to a hostile takeover attempt by a newly appointed independent director. The
disruption to the Company due to a drastic and immediate departure for the Company business plan, which resulted in SEC filings that
were substantially inaccurate, along with the subsequent litigation, which ultimately resulted in the departure of the independent board
members along with senior management, was a significant risk factor for the Company and will continue to be so moving forward. Further
detail will be provided in our third quarter filing along with our annual filing.
