1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”, or “Applied”) as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the six month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, have been included.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. Operating results for the six month period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Inventory The Company uses the LIFO method of valuing U.S. inventories.
An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each fiscal year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
LIFO expense of $ 8,853
and $ 4,675
in the three months ended
December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, and $ 17,913
and $ 8,246
in the six months ended
December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, is recorded in cost of sales in the condensed statements of consolidated income. Reportable Segments The Company has two reportable segments: Service Center Based Distribution and Engineered Solutions (formerly known as Fluid Power & Flow Control). The Company changed the reportable segment name to Engineered Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. There was no change in the composition of either reportable segment. These reportable segments contain the Company's various operating segments which have been aggregated based upon similar economic and operating characteristics. The Service Center Based Distribution segment operates through local service centers and distribution centers with a focus on providing products and services addressing the maintenance and repair of motion control infrastructure and production equipment. Products primarily include industrial bearings, motors, belting, drives, couplings, pumps, linear motion products, hydraulic and pneumatic components, filtration supplies, and hoses, as well as other related supplies for general operational needs of customers’ machinery and equipment. The Engineered Solutions segment includes our operations that specialize in distributing, engineering, designing, integrating, and repairing hydraulic and pneumatic fluid power technologies, and engineered flow control products and services. This segment also includes our operations that focus on advanced automation solutions including machine vision, robotics, motion control, industrial networking, and smart technologies. Qualified Defined Benefit Retirement Plan The Company's qualified defined benefit retirement plan, which provided benefits to certain hourly employees at retirement, was frozen in April 2018.
These employees did not participate in the Company's Retirement Savings Plan.
The Company terminated the plan effective February 28, 2022.
Participants elected to receive benefits as either a lump sum payment or through an annuity contract and the settlement of $ 8,895
was paid from plan assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
As a result of the plan termination, the Company recognized a loss of $ 1,184
in the three
months ended December 31, 2022, which is recorded in other expense (income), net in the condensed statements of consolidated income.
The Company has determined that activity related to the qualified defined benefit retirement plan is not material to the consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

This agreement provides a $ 900,000
unsecured revolving credit facility and an uncommitted accordion feature which allows the Company to request an increase in the borrowing commitments, or incremental term loans, under the credit facility in aggregate principal amounts of up to $ 500,000 .
Borrowings under this agreement bear interest, at the Company's election, at either the base rate plus a margin that ranges from
0
to
55
basis points based on net leverage ratio or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from
80
to
155
basis points based on the net leverage ratio.
Unused lines under this facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $ 200
to secure certain insurance obligations, totaled $ 489,208
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, and were available to fund future acquisitions or other capital and operating requirements.
The interest rate on the revolving credit facility was
5.35 %
and
2.81 % as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Additionally, the Company had letters of credit outstanding with separate banks, not associated with the revolving credit agreement, in the amount of $ 4,046
and $ 4,735
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, in order to secure certain insurance obligations. Trade Receivable Securitization Facility In August 2018, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the “AR Securitization Facility”).
On March 26, 2021, the Company amended the AR Securitization Facility to expand the eligible receivables, which increased the maximum availability to $ 250,000
and increased the fees on the AR Securitization Facility to
0.98 % per year.
Availability is further subject to changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration levels or certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred and, therefore, at certain times, we may not be able to fully access the $ 250,000
of funding available under the AR Securitization Facility.
The AR Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company’s borrowing capacity by collateralizing a portion of the amount of the U.S. operations’ trade accounts receivable.
The Company uses the proceeds from the AR Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs.
Borrowings under this facility carry variable interest rates tied to LIBOR.
The interest rate on the AR Securitization Facility as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was
5.36 % and
2.60 %, respectively.
The termination date of the AR Securitization Facility is March 26, 2024.
Unsecured Shelf Facility At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had borrowings outstanding under its unsecured shelf facility agreement with Prudential Investment Management of $ 50,000
and $ 90,000 , respectively.
Fees on this facility range from
0.25 % to
1.25 % per year based on the Company's leverage ratio at each quarter end.
The "Series C" notes carried a fixed interest rate of
3.19 %, and the remaining principal balance of $ 40,000
was paid in July 2022.
The "Series D" notes have a remaining principal amount of $ 25,000 , carry a fixed interest rate of
3.21 %, and are due in October 2023.
The “Series E” notes have a principal amount of $ 25,000 , carry a fixed interest rate of
3.08 %, and are due in October 2024.

of debt as a part of the headquarters facility acquisition.
The
1.50 % fixed interest rate note is held by the State of Ohio Development Services Agency, and matures in November 2024.
6.      DERIVATIVES Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.
The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.
The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments.
Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.
The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s borrowings.
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into interest expense, net in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt.
In January 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate variability in forecasted interest payments on $ 463,000
of the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured variable rate debt.
The notional amount declines over time.
The interest rate swap effectively converts a portion of the floating rate interest payment into a fixed rate interest payment.
The Company designated the interest rate swap as a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap instrument and is accounting for this derivative as a cash flow hedge.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed a transaction to amend and extend the interest rate swap agreement which resulted in an extension of the maturity date by an additional three years and a decrease of the weighted average fixed pay rate from
2.61 % to
1.63 %.
The pay-fixed interest rate swap is considered a hybrid instrument with a financing component and an embedded at-market derivative that was designated as a cash flow hedge. The interest rate swap converted $ 384,000  of variable rate debt to a rate of  2.54 % as of December 31, 2022.
The interest rate swap converted $ 409,000
of variable rate debt to a rate of
2.75 % as of June 30, 2022.
The fair value (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) of the interest rate cash flow hedge was $ 27,975
and $ 17,827
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, which is included in other current assets and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income, before tax to interest expense, net totaled $( 715 ) and $ 2,585
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 81
and $ 5,170
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 7.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Marketable securities measured at fair value at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 totaled $ 16,751
and $ 15,317 , respectively.
The majority of these marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust for a non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
The marketable securities are included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and their fair values were determined using quoted market prices (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy). As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the carrying values of the Company's fixed interest rate debt outstanding under its unsecured shelf facility agreement with Prudential Investment Management approximated fair value (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The revolving credit facility and the AR Securitization Facility contain variable interest rates and their carrying values approximate fair value (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). 14 Table of Contents APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS With more than 6,100 employees across North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, Applied Industrial Technologies (“Applied,” the “Company,” “We,” “Us” or “Our”) is a leading value-added distributor and technical solutions provider of industrial motion, fluid power, flow control, automation technologies, and related maintenance supplies. Our leading brands, specialized services, and comprehensive knowledge serve MRO (Maintenance, Repair & Operations) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) end users in virtually all industrial markets through our multi-channel capabilities that provide choice, convenience, and expertise.
We have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1923, the year our business was founded in Cleveland, Ohio.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, business was conducted in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore from 567 facilities. The following is Management's Discussion and Analysis of significant factors which have affected our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income and consolidated cash flows.
When reviewing the discussion and analysis set forth below, please note that the majority of SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) we sell in any given period were not necessarily sold in the comparable period of the prior year, resulting in the inability to quantify certain commonly used comparative metrics analyzing sales, such as changes in product mix and volume. Overview Consolidated sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 increased $183.4 million or 20.9% compared to the prior year quarter, with acquisitions increasing sales by $4.0 million or 0.5% and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $6.0 million decreasing sales by 0.7%.
The Company had operating income of $112.9 million, or operating margin of 10.6% of sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to an operating income of $78.2 million, or operating margin of 8.9% of sales for the same quarter in the prior year.
The quarter ended December 31, 2022 had net income of $80.5 million compared to net income of $57.0 million in the prior year quarter.
The current ratio was 3.2 to 1 at December 31, 2022 and 2.7 to 1 at June 30, 2022.
Applied monitors several economic indices that have been key indicators for industrial economic activity in the United States.
These include the Industrial Production (IP) and Manufacturing Capacity Utilization (MCU) indices published by the Federal Reserve Board and the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).
Historically, our performance correlates well with the MCU, which measures productivity and calculates a ratio of actual manufacturing output versus potential full capacity output.
When manufacturing plants are running at a high rate of capacity, they tend to wear out machinery and require replacement
parts.
The MCU (total industry) and IP indices have decreased since June 2022.
The MCU for December 2022 was 78.8, which is down from the September and June revised readings of 80.1 and 79.7, respectively.
The ISM PMI registered 48.4 in December, down from the September and June 2022 readings of 50.9 and 53.0, respectively.
The indices for the months during the current quarter, along with the indices for the prior fiscal year end and prior quarter end, were as follows: Index Reading Month MCU PMI IP December 2022 78.8 48.4 99.8 November 2022 79.4 49.0 101.1 October 2022 80.0 50.2 102.2 September 2022 80.1 50.9 101.9 June 2022 79.7 53.0 101.1 The number of Company employees was 6,157 at December 31, 2022, 6,075 at June 30, 2022, and 6,007 at December 31, 2021.
The number of operating facilities totaled 567 at December 31, 2022, 568 at June 30, 2022, and 569 at December 31, 2021. 19 Table of Contents APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 2:

There were 61 selling days in the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021.
Excluding the impact of businesses acquired and foreign currency translation, sales were up $185.4 million or 21.1% during the quarter, driven by an increase from operations reflecting resilient underlying demand across both segments, structural and secular tailwinds across legacy and new markets, and support from company-specific growth opportunities. The following table shows changes in sales by reportable segment ( amounts in millions ).
Sales by Reportable Segment Three Months Ended December 31, Sales Increase Amount of change due to Foreign Currency Organic Change 2022 2021 Acquisitions Service Center Based Distribution $ 705.4  $ 587.2  $ 118.2  $ —  $ (6.0) $ 124.2  Engineered Solutions 354.9  289.7  65.2  4.0  —  61.2  Total $ 1,060.3  $ 876.9  $ 183.4  $ 4.0  $ (6.0) $ 185.4  Sales from our Service Center Based Distribution segment, which operates primarily in MRO markets, increased $118.2 million or 20.1%.

Unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased other country sales by $1.2 million or 2.2%.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, other country sales were up $3.8 million, or 6.9% during the quarter. Our gross profit margin was 29.1% in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to 29.4% in the prior year quarter.
The gross profit margin for the current year quarter was negatively impacted by 39 basis points due to a $4.2 million increase in LIFO expense over the prior year quarter driven by ongoing inflationary impact. The following table shows the changes in selling, distribution and administrative expense (SD&A) (amounts in millions). Three Months Ended December 31, SD&A Increase Amount of change due to Foreign Currency Organic Change 2022 2021 Acquisitions SD&A $ 195.6  $ 179.4  $ 16.2  $ 1.6  $ (1.5) $ 16.1  SD&A consists of associate compensation, benefits and other expenses associated with selling, purchasing, warehousing, supply chain management and providing marketing and distribution of the Company's products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as human resources, information technology, treasury, accounting, insurance, legal, and facility related expenses.
SD&A was 18.4% of sales in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to 20.5% in the prior year quarter.
SD&A increased $16.2 million or 9.0% compared to the prior year quarter.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing SD&A during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 by $1.5 million or 0.9% compared to the prior year quarter.
SD&A from businesses acquired added $1.6 million or 0.9% of SD&A expenses, including $0.2 million of intangibles amortization related to acquisitions.
Excluding the impact of businesses acquired and the favorable currency translation impact, SD&A increased $16.1 million or 9.0% during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year quarter.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, total compensation increased $10.9 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to merit increases and an increase in employee incentive compensation correlating with the improved company performance.
In addition, bad debt expense increased $5.0 million due to provisions recorded in the current year for customer credit risk factors related to rising interest rates primarily in the U.S. operations of the Service Center Based Distribution segment.
Further , excluding acquisitions, travel & entertainment and fleet expenses increased $1.3 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 driven by higher fuel costs and the return of travel activity in the current quarter, along with reduced travel activity related to COVID-1 9 in the prior year quarter.
All other expenses within SD&A were down $1.1 million. Operating income increased $34.7 million, and as a percent of sales increased to 10.6% from 8.9% during the prior year quarter.
Operating income, as a percentage of sales for the Service Center Based Distribution segment increased to 12.3% in the current year quarter from 11.5% in the prior year quarter.
Operating income, as a percentage of sales for the Engineered Solutions segment increased to 14.5% in the current year quarter from 12.6% in the prior year quarter.
Other expense (income), net was expense of $0.8 million for the quarter, which included net other periodic benefit costs primarily related to the termination of the
qualified defined benefit retirement plan
of $1.2 million and net unfavorable foreign currency transaction losses of $0.7 million, offset by unrealized gains on investments held by non-qualified deferred compensation trusts of $1.1 million.
During the prior year quarter, other expense (income), net was income of $0.9 million, which included unrealized gains on investments held by non-qualified deferred compensation trusts of $1.0 million and $0.1 million of other income, offset by $0.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency transaction losses. The effective income tax rate was 24.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to 20.8% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in discrete favorable adjustments during the quarter ended
December 31, 2022
compared to the prior year quarter. As a result of the factors addressed above, net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 increased
$23.4 million
compared to the prior year quarter.
Net income per share was $2.05 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1.46 per share in the prior year quarter. 21 Table of Contents APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 2:

The effective income tax rate was 23.2% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 21.2% for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in discrete favorable adjustments during the current year period ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period.
We expect our full year tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be in the 22.0% to 24.0% range. 23 Table of Contents APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 2:
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As a result of the factors addressed above, net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $47.3 million compared to the prior year period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of capital is cash flow from operations, supplemented as necessary by bank borrowings or other sources of debt.
At December 31, 2022, we had total debt obligations outstanding of $649.4 million compared to $689.5 million at June 30, 2022.
Management expects that our existing cash, cash equivalents, funds available under the revolving credit facility, and cash provided from operations will be sufficient to finance normal working capital needs in each of the countries in which we operate, payment of dividends, acquisitions, investments in properties, facilities and equipment, debt service, and the purchase of additional Company common stock.
Management also believes that additional long-term debt and line of credit financing could be obtained based on the Company's credit standing and financial strength.
The Company's working capital at December 31, 2022 was $975.0 million, compared to $859.9 million at June 30, 2022.

Six Months Ended December 31, Net Cash Provided by (Used in): 2022 2021 Operating Activities $ 88,823  $ 81,264  Investing Activities (38,205) (28,877) Financing Activities (69,137) (153,443) Exchange Rate Effect (417) (1,846) Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (18,936) $ (102,902) The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 is driven by increased operating results offset by changes in working capital during the period.
Changes in cash flows between periods related to working capital were driven by (amounts in thousands): Inventories $ (31,557) Accounts payable $ (7,969) Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased from the prior period primarily due to $25.5 million used for the acquisition of Automation, Inc. in the current year compared to $7.0 million used for the acquisition of R.R. Floody in the prior year period, offset by $14.8 million in cash payments for loans on company-owned life insurance in the prior year.
Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to a change in net debt activity, as there was $40.1 million of debt payments in the current year period compared to $107.8 million of net debt payments in the prior year period.
Further, the Company used $0.7 million of cash for the purchase of treasury shares during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $10.1 million in the prior year period. Share Repurchases The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company's common stock.
These purchases may be made in open market and negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending upon market conditions. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not acquire any shares of treasury stock on the open market.
We acquired 35,000 shares of treasury stock on the open market in the three months ended December 31, 2021 for $3.5 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Borrowing Arrangements A summary of long-term debt, including the current portion, follows (amounts in thousands): December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Revolving credit facility $ 410,592  $ 410,592  Trade receivable securitization facility 188,300  188,300  Series C notes —  40,000  Series D notes 25,000  25,000  Series E notes 25,000  25,000  Other 480  603  Total debt $ 649,372  $ 689,495  Less: unamortized debt issuance costs 131  171  $ 649,241  $ 689,324  Revolving Credit Facility & Term Loan In December 2021, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with a group of banks to refinance the existing credit facility as well as provide funds for ongoing working capital and other general corporate purposes.
This agreement provides a $900.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and an uncommitted accordion feature which allows the Company to request an increase in the borrowing commitments, or incremental term loans, under the credit facility in aggregate principal amounts of up to $500.0 million.
Borrowings under this agreement bear interest, at the Company's election, at either the base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 55 basis points based on net leverage ratio or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 80 to 155 basis points based on the net leverage ratio.
Unused lines under this facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $0.2 million to secure certain insurance obligations, totaled $489.2 million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, and were available to fund future acquisitions or other capital and operating requirements.
The interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 5.35%
and 2.81% as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Additionally, the Company had letters of credit outstanding with separate banks, not associated with the revolving credit agreement, in the amount of $4.0 million and $4.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, in order to secure certain insurance obligations. Trade Receivable Securitization Facility In August 2018, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the “AR Securitization Facility”).
On March 26, 2021, the Company amended the AR Securitization Facility to expand the eligible receivables, which increased the maximum availability to $250.0 million and increased the fees on the AR Securitization Facility to 0.98% per year.
Availability is further subject to changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration levels or certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred and, therefore, at certain times, we may not be able to fully access the $250.0 million of funding available under the AR Securitization Facility.
The AR Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company’s borrowing capacity by collateralizing a portion of the amount of the U.S. operations’ trade accounts receivable.
The Company uses the proceeds from the AR Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs.
Borrowings under this facility carry variable interest rates tied to LIBOR.
The interest rate on the AR Securitization Facility as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was 5.36% and 2.60%, respectively.
The termination date of the AR Securitization Facility is March 26, 2024.
Unsecured Shelf Facility At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had borrowings outstanding under its unsecured shelf facility agreement with Prudential Investment Management of $50.0 million and $90.0 million, respectively.
Fees on this facility range from 0.25% to 1.25% per year based on the Company's leverage ratio at each quarter end.
The "Series C" notes carried a fixed interest rate of 3.19%, and the remaining principal balance of $40.0 million was paid in July 2022.
The "Series D" notes have a remaining principal amount of $25.0 million, carry a fixed interest rate of 3.21%, and are due in October 2023.
The “Series E” notes have a principal amount of $25.0 million, carry a fixed interest rate of 3.08%, and are due in October 2024.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Long-Term Borrowing In 2014, the Company assumed $2.4 million of debt as a part of the headquarters facility acquisition.
The 1.50% fixed interest rate note is held by the State of Ohio Development Services Agency, and matures in May 2024.
The Company entered into an interest rate swap which mitigates variability in forecasted interest payments on $384.0 million of the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured variable rate debt.
For more information, see note 6, Derivatives, to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 1 under the caption “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.” The credit facility and the unsecured shelf facility contain restrictive covenants regarding liquidity, net worth, financial ratios, and other covenants.
At December 31, 2022, the most restrictive of these covenants required that the Company have net indebtedness less than 3.75 times consolidated income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined). At December 31, 2022, the Company's net indebtedness was 1.1 times consolidated income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined).
The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants at December 31, 2022. Accounts Receivable Analysis The following table is included to aid in analysis of accounts receivable and the associated provision for losses on accounts receivable (amounts in thousands): December 31, June 30, 2022 2022 Accounts receivable, gross $ 680,020  $ 673,951  Allowance for doubtful accounts 25,510  17,522  Accounts receivable, net $ 654,510  $ 656,429  Allowance for doubtful accounts, % of gross receivables 3.8  % 2.6  % Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Provision for losses on accounts receivable $ 5,579  $ 531  $ 9,573  $ 1,328  Provision as a % of net sales 0.53  % 0.06  % 0.45  % 0.08  % Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist of trade receivables from customers.
Management monitors accounts receivable by reviewing Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and the aging of receivables for each of the Company's locations. On a consolidated basis, DSO was 55.6 at December 31, 2022 compared to 55.7 at June 30, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 4.1% of our accounts receivable balances are more than 90 days past due, compared to 3.4% at June 30, 2022.
On an overall basis, our provision for losses on accounts receivable represents 0.53% of our sales in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.06% of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and 0.45% of sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 0.08% of sales for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase primarily relates to provisions recorded in the current year for customer credit deterioration and bankruptcies primarily in the Service Center Based Distribution segment.
Historically, this percentage is around 0.10% to 0.15%.
Management believes the overall receivables aging and provision for losses on accounts receivable are at reasonable levels. Inventory An alysis Inventories are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for U.S. inventories and the average cost method for foreign inventories.  Management uses an inventory turnover ratio to monitor and evaluate inventory.  Management calculates this ratio on an annual as well as a quarterly basis, and believes that using average costs to determine the inventory turnover ratio instead of LIFO costs provides a more useful analysis.  The annualized inventory turnover based on average costs was 4.6 for the period ended December 31, 2022 and 4.7 for the period ended June 30, 2022.
