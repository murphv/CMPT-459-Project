(1) BASIS
OF PRESENTATION, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Basis
of Presentation:
The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Oconee Federal Financial Corp., which include the accounts of its
wholly owned subsidiary Oconee Federal Savings and Loan Association (the “Association”) (referred to herein as “the
Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Intercompany accounts
and transactions are eliminated during consolidation. The Company is majority owned ( 74.24 %) by Oconee Federal, MHC. These financial
statements do not include the transactions and balances of Oconee Federal, MHC.
In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only
of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2022 and June
30, 2022 and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. All interim amounts
are unaudited, and the results of operations for the interim periods herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
to be expected for the year ending June 30, 2023 or any other period. These consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Reclassifications:
Certain
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on net income
or shareholders’ equity as previously reported.
Cash
Flows:
Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand, federal funds sold, overnight interest-earning deposits and amounts due from other
depository institutions.
Use
of Estimates:
To
prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.
These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the disclosures provided,
and actual results could differ.
Risks
and Uncertainties:
The
COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company, its clients and the communities it serves.
Given its dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent of such
impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.

NEW ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS
Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848”.
Issued in December 2022, the FASB issued amendments to extend the period of time preparers can use the reference rate reform relief
guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, to address the
fact that all London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) tenors were not discontinued as of December 31, 2021, and some tenors will
be published until June 2023. The amendments are effective immediately for all entities and applied prospectively. The Company
does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.
ASU
2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions”.
Issued in June 2022, ASU 2022-03 provides guidance on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual
sale restriction and require specific disclosures related to such an equity security. The amendments are effective for financial
statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.
ASU
2022-02, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures”.
Issued in March 2022, ASU 2022-02 provides guidance to improve the decision usefulness of information provided to investors about
certain loan re-financings, restructurings, and write-offs. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect these
amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.
ASU
2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance”. Issued
in November 2021, ASU 2021-10 requires certain annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for
by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. The guidance is effective for financial
statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted this standard on July 1, 2022. This
pronouncement did not have a material effect on the financial statements.
ASU
2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)”. Issued in March 2020, ASU 2020-04 provides temporary optional guidance
to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The amendments are effective as of March 12, 2020 through
December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.
ASU
2019-11, “Codification to Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses”. Issued in November
2019, ASU 2019-11 provides guidance that addresses issues raised by stakeholders during the implementation of ASU 2016-13, Financial
Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments affect a variety
of Topics in the Accounting Standards Codification. For the Company, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period as long
as an entity has adopted the amendments in ASU 2016-13.
ASU
2019-10, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic
842)”. Issued in November 2019, ASU 2019-10 provides guidance to defer the effective dates for private companies, not-for-profit
organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies (such as the Company) applying standards on current expected credit losses
(CECL), derivatives, hedging and leases. For the Company, the new effective date for Credit Losses (CECL) will be for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For the Company, the effective dates for
Derivatives, Hedging and Leases were not deferred under this guidance.
ASU
2019-05, “Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief”. Issued in May 2019,
ASU 2019-05 provides entities with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option, applied on an instrument-by-instrument
basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. On October
16, 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) announced a delay in the implementation schedule allowing
certain entities, including smaller reporting companies (such as the Company) to adopt ASU 2016-13 in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those years.

NEW ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS (continued)
ASU
2016-13, “Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”.
Issued in June 2016, ASU 2016-13 provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit
losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment,
held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other commitments to extend credit
held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented
at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis.
The amendments in ASU 2016-13 eliminate the probable incurred loss recognition in current GAAP and reflect an entity’s current
estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current
conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets. For purchased financial
assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination (“PCD assets”) that are measured
at amortized cost, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit
loss expense. Subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses on PCD assets are recognized through the statement of income
as a credit loss expense. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for
credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on
its consolidated financial statements by running a parallel loss model. In November 2019, the FASB issued guidance delaying the
implementation schedule and allowing certain entities, including smaller reporting companies (such as the Company) to adopt ASU
2016-13 in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those years.
There
have been no accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies during the quarter
ended December 31, 2022 that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of standards previously issued and not yet effective, and has no changes
in its assessment since filing the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EARNINGS PER
SHARE (“EPS”)
Basic
EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and is adjusted for ESOP shares not yet committed to
be released. Unvested restricted stock awards, which contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends, are considered participating
securities and the two-class method of computing basic and diluted EPS is applied. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options, were exercised or
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. Diluted
EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include the effect of contracts
or securities exercisable (such as stock options) or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury
stock method.

The
Company evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) at least on a quarterly basis, and more
frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. The Company considers the length of time and the extent to
which the fair value has been less than amortized cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Additionally,
the Company considers its intent to sell or whether it will be more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior
to the security’s anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, the Company may
consider whether the securities are issued by federal Government agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred,
and the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition.
None
of the unrealized losses at December 31, 2022 were recognized into net income for the three or six months ended December 31, 2022
because the issuers’ bonds are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not
that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value
is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value of these securities is expected to recover as they approach their
maturity date or reset date. None of the unrealized losses at June 30, 2022 were recognized as having OTTI during the year ended
June 30, 2022.

COVID-19
Loan Modifications:
As
a result of disruptions in economic conditions caused by COVID-19, the financial regulators issued guidance encouraging banks
to work constructively with borrowers affected by the virus in our community. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, “Temporary
Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,” which was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2021, provided banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under ASC 340-10 troubled debt
restructuring classifications for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. We have not considered any
of the COVID-19 related modifications we performed to be troubled debt restructurings. Included in the table above are $ 5,047
in loans still remaining that were modified to defer principal payments or principal and interest payments from three to six months
based on the affected borrower’s request and need for COVID-19 financial relief. All loans modified for COVID-19 financial
relief were current at the time of modification. Of this amount, there were $ 3,480
in one-to-four family loans, $ 1,219
in non-residential
loans and $ 348
in multi-family loans. As of December 31, 2022, $ 4,878
of such loans were current and $ 169
were 30 days or more
past due. As of December 31, 2022, all of the COVID-19 related modifications had returned to regular payment status.

Included
in the table above are $ 7,459
in loans still remaining that were modified to defer principal payments or principal and interest
payments from three to six months based on the affected borrower’s request and need for COVID-19 financial relief. All loans
modified for COVID-19 financial relief were current at the time of modification. Of this amount, there were $ 4,846
in one-to-four
family loans, $ 2,246
in non-residential loans and $ 367
in multi-family loans. As of June 30, 2022, $ 6,984
were current and $ 475
were 30 days or more past due.
Troubled
Debt Restructurings:
At
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, total loans that have been modified as troubled debt restructurings were $ 484
and $ 869 , respectively,
which consisted of
one
non-residential real estate loan and
one
one-to-four family first lien loan at December 31, 2022 and
one
non-residential real estate loan and
two
one-to-four family first lien loans at June 30, 2022. Additionally, there were no commitments
to lend any additional amounts on any loan after the modification. No loans have been modified as troubled debt restructurings
during the six months ended December 31, 2022. No loans modified as troubled debt restructurings have defaulted since restructuring.
All of these loans are on nonaccrual at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, $ 456
and
$ 839 , respectively, were individually evaluated for impairment.
Allowance
for Loan Loss:
There
have been no changes to our allowance for loan loss methodology during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. We have assessed the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the allowance for loan loss using the information that is available.  However, the fluidity
of this pandemic precludes any prediction as to its ultimate impact. Due to the increase in the size of the loan portfolio, a
$ 50
provision for loan losses was recorded during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. We believe the recorded allowance is adequate
as of December 31, 2022. We will continue to review and make adjustments as may be necessary. To the best of our knowledge, we
have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021.

Loan
Grades:
The
Company utilizes a grading system whereby all loans are assigned a grade based on the risk profile of each loan. Loan grades are
determined based on an evaluation of relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current
financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among
other factors. All loans, regardless of size, are analyzed and are given a grade based upon the management’s assessment
of the ability of borrowers to service their debts.
Pass:
Loan assets of this grade conform to a preponderance of our underwriting criteria and are acceptable as a credit risk, based upon
the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor. Loans in this category also include loans secured by liquid assets and
secured loans to borrowers with unblemished credit histories.
Pass-Watch:
Loan assets of this grade represent our minimum level of acceptable credit risk. This grade may also represent obligations previously
rated “Pass”, but with significantly deteriorating trends or previously rated.
Special
Mention: Loan assets of this grade have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected,
these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit
position at some future date.
Substandard:
Loan assets of this grade are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral
pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They
are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful:
Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic
that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values,
highly questionable and improbable.
Portfolio
Segments:
One-to-four
family:
One-to-four family residential loans consist primarily of loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary
residences, and are originated as adjustable-rate or fixed-rate loans for the construction, purchase or refinancing of a mortgage.
These loans are collateralized by owner-occupied properties located in the Company’s market area. The Company currently originates
residential mortgage loans for our portfolio with loan-to-value ratios of up to
80 % for traditional owner-occupied homes.
For
traditional homes, the Company may originate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of
80 % if the borrower obtains mortgage
insurance or provides readily marketable collateral. The Company may make exceptions for special loan programs that we offer.
The Company also originates residential mortgage loans for non-owner-occupied homes with loan-to-value ratios of up to
80 %.
Multi-family:
Multi-family real estate loans generally have a maximum term of
five years
with a
30  year amortization period and a final
balloon payment and are secured by properties containing
five
or more units in the Company’s market area. These loans are generally
made in amounts of up to
75 % of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property with an appropriate projected
debt service coverage ratio. The Company’s underwriting analysis includes considering the borrower’s expertise and requires verification
of the borrower’s credit history, income and financial statements, banking relationships, independent appraisals, references and
income projections for the property. The Company generally obtains personal guarantees on these loans.
Multi-family
real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by one-to-four family residences. This greater risk
is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of
general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types
of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family residential real estate is typically dependent upon the
successful operation of the related real estate project.

Home
Equity:
The Company offers home equity loans and lines of credit secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences
in our market area. The Company’s home equity loans and lines of credit are limited to an
80 % loan-to-value ratio (including
all prior liens). Standard residential mortgage underwriting requirements are used to evaluate these loans. The Company offers
adjustable-rate and fixed-rate options for these loans with a maximum term of
10
years. The repayment terms on lines of credit
are interest only monthly with principle due at maturity. Home equity loans have a more traditional repayment structure with principal
and interest due monthly. The maximum term on home equity loans is
10
years with an amortization schedule not exceed
20
years.
Nonresidential
Real Estate:
Nonresidential loans include those secured by real estate mortgages on churches, owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied
commercial buildings of various types, retail and office buildings, hotels, and other business and industrial properties. The
nonresidential real estate loans that the Company originates generally have terms of
five  to
20
years with amortization periods
up to
20  years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our nonresidential real estate loans is generally
75 %.
Loans
secured by nonresidential real estate generally are larger than one-to-four family residential loans and involve greater credit
risk. Nonresidential real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment
of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the
businesses conducted on such property, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market
or the economy in general, including the current adverse conditions.
The
Company considers a number of factors in originating nonresidential real estate loans. The Company evaluates the qualifications
and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, cash flows, the applicable business plan, the financial resources
of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with the
Company and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors the Company considers include
the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised
value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). The collateral
underlying all nonresidential real estate loans is appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by our board of directors.
Personal guarantees may be obtained from the principals of nonresidential real estate borrowers.
Agricultural:
These loans are secured by farmland and related improvements in the Company’s market area. These loans generally have
terms of
five
to
20
years with amortization periods up to
20
years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of these loans is generally
75 %. The Company is managing a small number of these loans in our portfolio. We continue to closely monitor our existing relationships.
Loans
secured by agricultural real estate generally are larger than one-to-four family residential loans and involve greater credit
risk. Agricultural real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment
of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the
businesses conducted on such property, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market
or the economy in general, including the current adverse conditions.
Construction
and Land:
The Company makes construction loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences and to commercial
businesses for their real estate needs. These loans generally have maximum terms of twelve months, and upon completion of construction
convert to conventional amortizing mortgage loans. Residential construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one-to-four
family residential mortgage loans that the Company originates. Commercial construction loans have rate and terms comparable to
commercial loans that we originate. During the construction phase, the borrower generally pays interest only. Generally, the maximum
loan-to-value ratio of our owner-occupied construction loans is
80 %. Residential construction loans are generally underwritten
pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential mortgage loans. Commercial construction loans are generally
underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating commercial loans.
The
Company also makes interim construction loans for nonresidential properties. In addition, the Company occasionally makes loans
for the construction of homes “on speculation,” but the Company generally permits a borrower to have only
two
such loans
at a time. These loans generally have a maximum term of
eight months , and upon completion of construction convert to conventional
amortizing nonresidential real estate loans. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to permanent loans secured
by property of the type being constructed that we originate. Generally, the maximum loan-to-value ratio of these construction
loans is
85 %.

Commercial and industrial loans are offered to businesses and professionals in the Company’s
market area. These loans generally have short and medium terms on both a collateralized and uncollateralized basis. The structure
of these loans are largely determined by the loan purpose and collateral. Sources of collateral can include a lien on furniture,
fixtures, equipment, inventory, receivables and other assets of the company. A UCC-1 is typically filed to perfect our lien on
these assets.
Commercial
and industrial loans and leases typically are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s or lessee’s ability to make
repayment from the cash flow of its business and generally are collateralized by business assets. As a result, such loans and
leases involve additional complexities, variables and risks and require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types
of loans and leases.
Consumer
and Other Loans:
The Company offers installment loans for various consumer purposes, including the purchase of automobiles,
boats, and for other legitimate personal purposes. The maximum terms of consumer loans is
18  months for unsecured loans and
18
to
60  months for loans secured by a vehicle, depending on the age of the vehicle. The Company generally only extends consumer
loans to existing customers or their immediate family members, and these loans generally have relatively low balances.
Consumer
loans may entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured
or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the
borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore,
the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be
recovered on such loans.

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair
value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three
levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:
Level
1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access
as of the measurement date.
Level
2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted
prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level
3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability.
Investment
Securities:
The
fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted
prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where
quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows
or other market indicators (Level 3). We invest in the common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and in preferred
and common stock of First National Bankers Bancshares, Inc. The stock is classified as restricted equity securities and is carried
at cost.
Impaired
Loans:
The
fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate
appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales
and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between
the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification
of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the
borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge,
changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and
client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for
additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. There were no impaired loans with specific allocations at December 31, 2022 or
June 30, 2022.
Loans
Held for Sale:
Loans
held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is evaluated on a pool-level basis. The fair value of loans
held for sale is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other observable
market data, such as outstanding commitments from third party investors and result in a Level 2 classification.
Loan
Servicing Rights:
Fair
value is determined based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The
valuation model utilizes assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income and that can
be validated against available market data and results in a Level 3 classification.

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
Real
Estate Owned:
Assets
acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing
a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair
value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals, which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals
may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments
are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales
and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs
for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted
accordingly.
Appraisals
for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial
properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed
and verified by the Company. Once received, management reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well
as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.
On an annual basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of collateral that has been sold to the most recent appraised
value to determine what additional adjustment should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value.
Deposits:
The
fair values disclosed for demand deposit, money market and savings accounts are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting
date resulting in a Level 2 classification. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted
cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated
expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.
FHLB
Advances:
The
fair values of the Company’s FHLB advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the current borrowing
rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification.
Assets
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are summarized below:

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
On
April 5, 2012, the shareholders of Oconee Federal Financial Corp. approved the Oconee Federal Financial Corp. 2012 Equity Incentive
Plan (the “Plan”) for employees and directors of the Company. The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to
435,472
shares
of the Company’s common stock, with no more than
124,420
of shares as restricted stock awards and
311,052
as stock options,
either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan could not
be less than the fair market value on the date the stock option was granted. The compensation committee of the board of directors
had sole discretion to determine the amount and to whom equity incentive awards were granted. The Plan remains in effect as long
as any awards or options are outstanding. However, the ability to grant awards or options ceased as of April 5, 2022.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of such words as estimate,
project, believe, intend, anticipate, plan, seek, expect and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include:
● statements
of our goals, intentions and expectations;
● statements
regarding our business plans and prospects and growth and operating strategies;
● statements
regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and
● estimates
of our risks and future costs and benefits.
These
forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business,
economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking
statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We
are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.
The
following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations
expressed in the forward-looking statements:
● our
ability to manage our operations in response to changes in economic conditions (including
real estate values, loan demand, inflation, commodity prices and employment levels) nationally
and in our market areas;
● the
social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic;
● adverse
changes in the financial industry, securities, credit and national and local real estate
markets (including real estate values);
● significant
increases in our delinquencies and loan losses, including as a result of our inability
to resolve classified assets, changes in the underlying cash flows of our borrowers,
and management’s assumptions in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses;
● credit
risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies
and write-offs and in our allowance and provision for loan losses;
● use
of estimates for determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which may prove
to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuations;
● increased
competition among depository and other financial institutions;
● our
ability to attract and maintain deposits, including introducing new deposit products;
● inflation
and changes in interest rates generally, including changes in the relative differences
between short term and long term interest rates and in deposit interest rates, that may
affect our net interest margin and funding sources;
● fluctuations
in the demand for loans, which may be affected by the number of unsold homes, land and
other properties in our market areas and by declines in the value of real estate in our
market area;
● declines
in the yield on our assets resulting from the current low interest rate environment;
● our
ability to successfully implement our business strategies, including attracting and maintaining
deposits and introducing new financial products;
● risks
related to high concentration of loans secured by real estate located in our market areas;
● changes
in the level of government support of housing finance;
● the
results of examinations by our regulators, including the possibility that our regulators
may, among other things, require us to increase our reserve for loan losses, write down
assets, change our regulatory capital position, limit our ability to borrow funds or
maintain or increase deposits, or prohibit us from paying dividends, which could adversely
affect our dividends and earnings;
● our
ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;
● changes
in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, which
could result in, among other things, increased deposit insurance premiums and assessments,
capital requirements (particularly the new capital regulations), regulatory fees and
compliance costs and the resources we have available to address such changes;
● changes
in the ability of third-party providers to perform their obligations to us;
● technological
changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected;
● cyber-attacks,
computer viruses and other technological risks that may breach the security of our websites
or other systems to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data
or disable our systems;
● the
effect of any global or national war, conflict or act of terrorism;
● our
reliance on a small executive staff;
● changes
in our compensation and benefit plans, and our ability to retain key members of our senior
management team and to address staffing needs to implement our strategic plan;
● changes
in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;
32
● changes
in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;
● our
ability to control costs and expenses, particularly those related to operating as a publicly
traded company;
● the
effects of actual government shutdowns;
● the
ability of the U.S. government to manage federal debt limits;
● other
changes in our financial condition or results of operations that reduce capital available
to pay dividends;
● other
changes in the financial condition or future prospects of issuers of securities that
we own, including our stock in the FHLB of Atlanta; and
● other
economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and operational factors affecting our
operations, pricing, products and services.
Critical
Accounting Policies
There
were no material changes to the critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for Oconee Federal
Financial Corp. for the year ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Comparison
of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022
Our
total assets increased by $20.4 million, or 3.8%, to $565.2 million at December 31, 2022 from $544.8 million at June 30, 2022.
Total
cash and cash equivalents decreased $2.7 million, or 28.1%, to $7.0 million at December 31, 2022 from $9.7 million at June 30,
2022. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to normal periodic fluctuations.
Our
available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased by $13.1 million from $151.3 million at June 30, 2022 to $138.2 million at December
31, 2022. The decrease in securities classified as available-for-sale was primarily a result of unrealized losses in the portfolio
due to the rising interest rate environment.
Gross
loans increased $33.9 million, or 9.8%, to $379.0 million at December 31, 2022 from $345.1 million at June 30, 2022. This increase
was primarily a result of loan originations generally outpacing loan repayments during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Restricted
equity securities increased by $1.2 million from $1.2 million at June 30, 2022 to $2.4 million at December 31, 2022. The increase
was a result of an increase in FHLB stock associated with increased FHLB borrowings.
Deferred
tax assets increased by $1.4 million from $4.7 million at June 30, 2022 to $6.1 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily a result of the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio due to the rising interest rate environment.
Deposits
decreased $4.0 million, or 0.9%, to $455.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $459.7 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in
deposits was due to normal periodic fluctuations. Oconee Federal, MHC’s cash is held on deposit with the Association. We
generally do not accept brokered deposits and no brokered deposits were accepted during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
FHLB
advances increased $28.0 million, or 311.1%, to $37.0 million at December 31, 2022 from $9.0 million at June 30, 2022. The increase
was due to funding needs for loan growth. We have credit available under a loan agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta
in the amount of 25% of our total assets as of December 31, 2022, or approximately $137.8 million. We had no federal funds purchased
as of December 31, 2022 or as of June 30, 2022.
Total
shareholders’ equity decreased $3.6 million, or 4.8%, to $71.6 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $75.3 million at
June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily the result of net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of $2.4 million
being offset by $5.0 million in other comprehensive loss, and $1.1 million in dividends distributed. The other comprehensive loss
is attributed to unrecognized losses in the investment portfolio due to rising market rates. The Association exceeded all regulatory
capital requirements at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.

All
nonperforming loans in the table above were classified either as substandard or doubtful. There were no other loans that are not
already disclosed where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers that caused us serious doubts about the
ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future.
Nonperforming
assets decreased $1.0 million from $2.1 million as of June 30, 2022 to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Nonaccrual loans
decreased $1.1 million to $1.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and real estate owned increased $106 thousand to $106 thousand
as of December 31, 2022.There were no accruing loans past due 90 days or more at either date. The decrease in nonaccrual loans
primarily related to normal monthly fluctuations combined with payoffs. Nonperforming assets to total assets and nonperforming
assets to loans and real estate owned were 0.19% and 0.28%, respectively, at December 31, 2022 compared to 0.38% and 0.60%, respectively
at June 30, 2022.

Analysis
of Net Interest Margin
The
following table sets forth average balance sheets, average annualized yields and rates, and certain other information for the
periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances
are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in
the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs, discounts and premiums
that are amortized or accreted to income.

Rate/Volume
Analysis
The
following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of our
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Information is provided for each category of interest-earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (i.e., changes in average
balances multiplied by the prior-period average rate) and (ii) changes attributable to rate (i.e., changes in average
rate multiplied by prior-period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which
cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. There are no
out-of-period items or adjustments to exclude from this table.

Comparison
of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021
General.  We
reported net income of $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net income of $1.2 million for
the three months ended December 31, 2021. Interest income increased $360 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022
compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 and interest expense increased $362 thousand, resulting in a net decrease
to net interest income of $2 thousand. Noninterest income decreased $53 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022
compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Total noninterest expense decreased $62 thousand. Tax expense increased
$97 thousand.
Interest
Income.  Interest income increased by $360 thousand to $4.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
The yield on interest-earning assets increased five basis points from 3.39% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 3.44%
for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Total average interest-earning assets increased by $33.6 million to $537.4 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $503.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest
income on loans increased by $63 thousand to $3.8 million from $3.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, respectively. The yield on loans decreased 33 basis points from 4.41% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to
4.08% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in yield is primarily due to lower deferred fees recognized in
the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The average balance of loans increased
by $33.2 million, or 9.8%, to $371.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $337.9 million for the three months
ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the average balance of our loans is reflective of increased originations offsetting normal
loan repayments.
Interest
income on investment securities increased $281 thousand, or 53.3%, to $808 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022
from $527 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This was the result of an increase of $5.6 million, or 3.5%,
in the average balances of securities to $163.4 million from $157.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, combined with an increase in the total average yield of our investment securities of 64 basis points to 1.98% from
1.34%. The increase in average balances of our investment securities is reflective of our efforts during the past twelve months
to invest in higher yielding assets. Our increased yields are reflective of overall higher investment rates that were available
on purchases made during the prior twelve months.
Income
on other interest earning assets increased by $16 thousand, or 98.3%, to $32 thousand for the three months ended December 31,
2022 from $16 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased
$5.1 million to $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $8.1 million for the three months ended December
31, 2021 and the yield increased 357 basis points over the same period. The decrease in average balance was primarily due to money
market funds being used to purchase higher yielding assets during the prior twelve months. The increase in yield was primarily
a result of a shift in composition of earning assets in this category combined with an overall increase in market rates. Money
market funds decreased resulting in a higher percentage of restricted equity securities, which earned higher rates during the
three months ended December 31, 2022. Federal Funds rates increased due to an overall increase in market rates.
Interest
Expense.
Interest expense increased $362 thousand, or 125.7%, to $650 thousand for the three months ended December 31,
2022 from $288 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased
31 basis points from 0.29% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 0.60% for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Interest
expense on deposits increased $135 thousand, or 50.2%, to $404 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $269
thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased 13 basis points
from 0.27% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 0.40% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The average balance
of interest bearing deposits increased $5.7 million, or 1.5%, to $398.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from
$392.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest
expense on certificates of deposit increased by $53 thousand, or 26.1%, to $256 thousand for the three months ended December 31,
2022 from $203 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense on these deposits was attributable
to an increase in the average cost on these deposits to 0.62% from 0.45%, offset by a $16.5 million decrease in average balances.
The increase in interest cost on these deposits is due to an overall increase in market rates. The decrease in the average balance
of these deposits is reflective of normal deposit fluctuation.
Interest
expense on NOW, demand deposits, regular savings and other deposits increased by $23 thousand to $58 thousand for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 from $35 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense
on these deposits was attributable to a $14.1 million increase in average balances, combined with an increase in the average cost
on these deposits to 0.16% from 0.11%. The increase in interest cost on these deposits is due to an overall increase in market
rates. The increase in the average balance of these deposits is reflective of normal deposit fluctuation.
38
Interest
expense on money market deposits increased by $59 thousand, or 190.3%, to $90 thousand for the three months ended December 31,
2022 from $31 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense on these deposits was
attributable to an increase in the average cost on these deposits to 0.38% from 0.14% combined with a $8.1 million increase in
average balances. The increase in interest cost on these deposits is reflective of an overall increase in market rates. The increase
in the average balance of these deposits is reflective of normal deposit fluctuation.
Interest
expense for other borrowings increased by $227 thousand, or 1,186.8%, to $246 thousand for the three months ended December 31,
2022 from $19 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Other borrowings include both FHLB advances as well as any
overnight federal funds purchased. The increase in interest expense on other borrowings was attributable to an increase in the
average cost of the borrowings to 3.43% from 1.52% combined with a $23.5 million increase in average balances. The increase in
the cost of these borrowings is reflective of an overall increase in market rates. The increase in the average balance of these
borrowings is reflective of funding needs for loan growth.
Net
Interest Income.  Net interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased by $2 thousand, or 0.05%, to
$4.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Our interest rate spread and net interest margin decreased to 2.84%
and 2.96%, from 3.10% and 3.16%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase
in income on earning assets was less than the increase in cost of interest bearing liabilities, resulting in the decrease in net
interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Provision
for Loan Losses.  We recorded a $50 thousand provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2022
and no provision for the three months ended December 31, 2021. There were no charge-offs for the three months ended December 31,
2022 or for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The provision for the three months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily
due to the growth of the loan portfolio balance.
Our
total allowance for loan losses was $1.4 million, or 0.38% of total gross loans as of December 31, 2022 and $1.3 million, or 0.39%,
of total gross loans as of June 30, 2022. There were no specifically identified impaired loans at December 31, 2022 or June 30,
2022. Total loans individually evaluated for impairment decreased $970 thousand, or 68.0%, to $456 thousand at December 31, 2022
compared to $1.4 million at June 30, 2022.
To
the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021. There have been no changes to our allowance for loan loss methodology during three months ended December
31, 2022.
Noninterest
Income.  Noninterest income decreased $53 thousand, or 13.2%, to $350 thousand for the three months ended December
31, 2022 from $403 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The net gain on sale of mortgage loans reflected a $2
thousand loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and a $42 thousand gain for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Loan sales declined due to a decrease in demand brought on by the increased rate environment. Changes in all other noninterest
income items were due to normal periodic fluctuations.
Noninterest
Expense.  Noninterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $62 thousand, or 2.1%, to
$2.9 million for three months ended December 31, 2022 from $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Salaries
and employee benefits decreased $64 thousand due to reduced ESOP costs, as the ESOP loan was fully repaid in December 2022, and
higher deferred loan costs. Data processing increased $20 thousand due to routine upgrades and volume increases in the current
period. Professional and supervisory fees decreased $23 thousand due to normal periodic fluctuations. For the three months ended
December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain in the value of the loan servicing asset of $17 thousand compared to a $11 thousand gain
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The fair value of our loan servicing asset is subject to significant fluctuations
as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Changes in all other noninterest
expense items were due to normal periodic fluctuations.
Income
Tax Expense.  Tax expense increased $97 thousand, or 66.0%, to $244 thousand for the three months ended December 31,
2022 from $147 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily due to a smaller permanent tax benefit
being recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, which
was a result of fewer nonqualified stock options being exercised during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our effective income tax rate was 18.2% and 10.6% for the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
39
Comparison
of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021
General.  We
reported net income of $2.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net income of $2.0 million for the
six months ended December 31, 2021. Interest income increased $946 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared
to the six months ended December 31, 2021 and interest expense increased $317 thousand, resulting in a net increase to net interest
income of $629 thousand. Noninterest income increased $26 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the
six months ended December 31, 2021. Total noninterest expense decreased $149 thousand. Tax expense increased $276 thousand.
Interest
Income.  Interest income increased by $946 thousand to $9.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The
yield on interest-earning assets increased 20 basis points from 3.24% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to 3.44% for
the six months ended December 31, 2022. Total average interest-earning assets increased by $25.7 million to $530.2 million for
the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $504.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest
income on loans increased by $284 thousand to $7.5 million from $7.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, respectively. The yield on loans decreased 12 basis points from 4.24% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to
4.12% for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in yield is primarily due to lower deferred fees recognized in
the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The average balance of loans increased
by $24.2 million, or 7.2%, to $361.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $337.7 million for the six months
ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the average balance of our loans is reflective of increased originations offsetting normal
loan repayments.
Interest
income on investment securities increased $641 thousand, or 66.4%, to $1.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022
from $965 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. This was the result of an increase of $13.2 million, or 8.7%, in
the average balances of securities to $164.8 million from $151.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, combined with an increase in the total average yield of our investment securities of 68 basis points to 1.95% from
1.27%. The increase in average balances of our investment securities is reflective of our efforts during the past twelve months
to invest in higher yielding assets. Our increased yields are reflective of overall higher investment rates that were available
on purchases made during the prior twelve months.
Income
on other interest earning assets increased by $21 thousand, or 68.0%, to $52 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2022
from $31 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased $11.7
million to $3.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $15.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021
and the yield increased 257 basis points over the same period. The decrease in average balance was primarily due to money market
funds being used to purchase higher yielding assets during the prior twelve months. The increase in yield was primarily a result
of a shift in composition of earning assets in this category combined with an overall increase in market rates. Money market funds
decreased resulting in a higher percentage of restricted equity securities, which earned higher rates during the six months ended
December 31, 2022. Federal Funds rates increased due to an overall increase in market rates.
Interest
Expense.
Interest expense increased $317 thousand, or 51.4%, to $934 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2022
from $617 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased
13 basis points from 0.31% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to 0.44% for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Interest
expense on deposits increased $46 thousand, or 8.0%, to $621 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $575 thousand
for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased two basis points from
0.29% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to 0.31% for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The average balance of interest
bearing deposits increased $8.9 million, or 2.3%, to $399.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $390.4 million
for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest
expense on certificates of deposit decreased by $50 thousand, or 11.4%, to $390 thousand for the six months ended December 31,
2022 from $440 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in interest expense on these deposits was attributable
to a stable average cost on these deposits of 0.48% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, combined
with a $19.8 million decrease in average balances. The decrease in the average balance of these deposits is reflective of normal
deposit fluctuation.
Interest
expense on NOW, demand deposits, regular savings and other deposits increased by $27 thousand to $99 thousand for the six months
ended December 31, 2022 from $72 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense on
these deposits was attributable to a $19.5 million increase in average balances, combined with an increase in the average cost
on these deposits to 0.14% from 0.11%. The increase in interest cost on these deposits is due to an overall increase in market
rates. The increase in the average balance of these deposits is reflective of normal deposit fluctuation.
40
Interest
expense on money market deposits increased by $69 thousand, or 109.5%, to $132 thousand for the six months ended December 31,
2022 from $63 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense on these deposits was
attributable to an increase in the average cost on these deposits to 0.28% from 0.15% combined with a $9.1 million increase in
average balances. The increase in interest cost on these deposits is reflective of an overall increase in market rates. The increase
in the average balance of these deposits is reflective of normal deposit fluctuation.
Interest
expense for other borrowings increased by $271 thousand, or 644.5%, to $313 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2022
from $42 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Other borrowings include both FHLB advances as well as any overnight
federal funds purchased. The increase in interest expense on other borrowings was attributable to an increase in the average cost
of the borrowings to 3.05% from 0.87% combined with a $10.8 million increase in average balances. The increase in the cost of
these borrowings is reflective of an overall increase in market rates. The increase in the average balance of these borrowings
is reflective of funding needs for loan growth.
Net
Interest Income.  Net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased by $629 thousand, or 8.3%, to
$8.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Our interest rate spread and net interest margin increased to 2.99% and
3.09%, from 2.93% and 2.99%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in income
on earning assets was more than the increase in cost of interest bearing liabilities, resulting in the increase in net interest
margin for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Provision
for Loan Losses.  We recorded a $100 thousand provision for loan losses for the six months ended December 31, 2022
and no provision for the six months ended December 31, 2021. There were no charge-offs for the six months ended December 31, 2022
or for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The provision for the six months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the
growth of the loan portfolio balance.
Our
total allowance for loan losses was $1.4 million, or 0.38% of total gross loans as of December 31, 2022 and $1.3 million, or 0.39%,
of total gross loans as of June 30, 2022. There were no specifically identified impaired loans at December 31, 2022 or June 30,
2022. Total loans individually evaluated for impairment decreased $970 thousand, or 68.0%, to $456 thousand at December 31, 2022
compared to $1.4 million at June 30, 2022.
To
the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021. There have been no changes to our allowance for loan loss methodology during six months ended December
31, 2022.
Noninterest
Income.  Noninterest income increased $26 thousand, or 3.2%, to $841 thousand for the six months ended December 31,
2022 from $815 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The net gain on sale of mortgage loans reflected a $6 thousand
gain for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and a $149 thousand gain for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Loan sales
declined due to a decrease in demand brought on by the increased rate environment. The change in the fair value of equity securities
was a loss of $5 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a loss of $49 thousand for the six months ended
December 31, 2021. Gains or losses on the fair value of equity securities are market driven. There were $84 thousand in losses
on the sale of securities for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and no sale of securities for the six months ended December
31, 2021. Securities were sold during the six months ended December 31, 2022 to adjust the investment portfolio to yield higher
net earnings going forward. The net gain on payoff of purchase credit impaired loans was $189 thousand for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 due to the liquidation of one loan. Changes in all other noninterest income items were due to normal periodic
fluctuations.
Noninterest
Expense.  Noninterest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $149 thousand, or 2.5%, to $5.8
million for six months ended December 31, 2022 from $6.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Salaries and employee
benefits decreased $161 thousand due to reduced ESOP costs, as the ESOP loan was fully repaid in December 2022, and higher deferred
loan costs. Data processing increased $38 thousand due to routine upgrades and volume increases in the current period. Professional
and supervisory fees decreased $3 thousand due to normal periodic fluctuations. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, we
recognized a gain in the value of the loan servicing asset of $19 thousand compared to a $3 thousand loss for the six months ended
December 31, 2021. The fair value of our loan servicing asset is subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in
estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Changes in all other noninterest expense items were due to
normal periodic fluctuations.
41
Income
Tax Expense.  Tax expense increased $276 thousand, or 75.8%, to $640 thousand for the six months ended December 31,
2022 from $364 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily due to a smaller permanent tax benefit
being recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, which was
a result of fewer nonqualified stock options being exercised during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
six months ended December 31, 2021. Our effective income tax rate was 20.8% and 15.4% for the six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Our
primary sources of funds are deposits and the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage
prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We generally manage the pricing
of our deposits to be competitive within our market and to increase core deposit relationships.
Liquidity
management is both a daily and long-term responsibility of management. Our liquidity monitoring process is designed to contend
with changing economic situations, which would include the COVID-19 pandemic. We have therefore not changed our daily or long-term
liquidity management procedures. We adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon management’s assessment of (i) expected
loan demand, (ii) expected deposit flows, (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and investment securities,
and (iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning
overnight deposits, federal funds sold, and short and intermediate-term U.S. Treasury and Government sponsored agencies and mortgage-backed
securities of short duration. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have credit available under
a loan agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta in the amount of 25% of total assets, as of December 31, 2022, or
approximately $137.8 million as of that date, with a remaining availability of $100.8 million as of December 31, 2022.
Common
Stock Dividends.
On August 25, 2022 and November 23, 2022, the Company paid a $0.10 per share cash dividend on its common
stock for a total of $1.1 million.
