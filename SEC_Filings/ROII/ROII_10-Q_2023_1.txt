ECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER 31, 2022
NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Ecoark Holdings Inc. (“Ecoark Holdings”
or the “Company”) is a holding company, incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 19, 2007. Through December 31, 2022,
Ecoark Holdings’ former wholly owned subsidiaries with the exception of Agora Digital Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Agora”)
and Zest Labs, Inc. (“Zest Labs”) have been treated for accounting purposes as divested. See below in this Note 1 and Note
2 “Discontinued Operations.” As a result of the divestitures, all assets and liabilities of the former subsidiaries have been
reclassified to discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated balance sheet for March 31, 2022 and all operations of these companies
have been reclassified to discontinued operations and gain on disposal on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the
nine and three months ended December 31, 2022.
The Company’s principal subsidiaries consisted
of Ecoark, Inc. (“Ecoark”), a Delaware corporation which was the parent of Zest Labs, Banner Midstream Corp., a Delaware corporation
(“Banner Midstream”) and Agora which was assigned the membership interest in Trend Discovery Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
liability corporation (all references to “Trend Holdings” or “Trend” are now synonymous with Agora) from the Company
on September 17, 2021 upon its formation, which includes Bitstream Mining, LLC, the Company’s Bitcoin mining subsidiary.
As disclosed in these Notes, the Company had decided
it was in the best interests of its stockholders that it divest all of its principal operating assets through a series of spin-offs or
stock dividends to the Company’s stockholders. It intended to do so either by engaging in business combinations with existing public
companies which have trading symbols and markets like White River Energy Corp (formerly Fortium Holdings Corp.) (“WTRV”) which
acquired White River Holdings Corp on July 25, 2022, and Wolf Energy Services, Inc. (formerly Enviro Technologies US, Inc.) (“Wolf
Energy”) which acquired Banner Midstream Corp. on September 7, 2022, or by direct dividends. The Company’s plan was also driven
by the dividends it must pay to an investor which provided $ 12
million on June 8, 2022 in exchange for preferred stock and a warrant,
the former of which was subsequently amended, and the latter of which was subsequently cancelled. Because all spin-offs require the transactions
to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company did not complete any spin-offs in calendar 2022. Because of
the plans to spin-off its principal operating subsidiaries, the Company is searching for one or more operating businesses to acquire.
See Note 20. “Subsequent Events” concerning a proposed acquisition. The Company has decided to leave Agora and Zest Labs in
the Company and to not proceed with the spin-offs of these entities, although it intends to create a trust to distribute at least
95 %
of the net proceeds of the pending Zest Labs litigation recoveries, if any, to the Company’s stockholders as of September 30, 2022.
On March 27, 2020, the Company and Banner Energy
Services Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Banner Parent”), entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Banner
Purchase Agreement”) to acquire Banner Midstream Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Banner Midstream”). Pursuant to the
acquisition, Banner Midstream became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Banner Parent received shares of the Company’s
common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Banner Midstream.
Banner Midstream had four operating subsidiaries:
Pinnacle Frac Transport LLC (“Pinnacle Frac”), Capstone Equipment Leasing LLC (“Capstone”), White River Holdings
Corp (“White River”), and Shamrock Upstream Energy LLC (“Shamrock”). Pinnacle Frac provides transportation of
frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Capstone procures and finances equipment to oilfield
transportation service contractors. White River is and Shamrock was engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations
on over
30,000
cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Louisiana, and Mississippi. All of these operating subsidiaries have since
been divested in two separate transactions that occurred in July and September 2022.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER 31, 2022
For a full description of the operations of White
River as well as Pinnacle Frac and Capstone, refer to the Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 filed on
July 7, 2022.
On July 25, 2022, the Company entered into and
closed a Share Exchange Agreement, by and among the Company, White River and WTRV. As a result, White River became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of WTRV and issued the Company non-voting Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A”) which is convertible into
approximately
82 % of WTRV’s common stock (not giving effect to the conversion of outstanding common stock equivalents) after the
Company elects to spin-off WTRV common stock to the Company’s stockholders and a registration statement covering the spin-off has
been declared effective. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is also the Executive Chairman of WTRV, and the Company’s Chief
Financial Officer is the Chief Executive Officer of WTRV. The former Chief Executive Officer and director of WTRV is the son-in-law of
the Company’s Executive Chairman, and he resigned from all positions with WTRV in connection with the closing. The new Board of
Directors (the “Board”) of WTRV includes the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Executive Officer’s
daughter as well as three other designees. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary in this transaction and has
concluded that no consolidation is required for White River as a variable interest entity.
On August
23, 2022 the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Wolf Energy and Banner Midstream.
Pursuant
to the Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company acquired 51,987,832 shares of the Wolf Energy
common stock in exchange for all of the capital stock of Banner Midstream owned by the Company, which represents 100% of the issued and
outstanding shares (the “Exchange”). Following the closing of the Agreement which occurred on September 7, 2022, Banner Midstream
continues as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wolf Energy.
On September 7, 2022, the Exchange was completed, and Banner Midstream became
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wolf
Energy . The shares the Company that were issued by Wolf
Energy
represented approximately 70% of the total voting shares of Wolf
Energy
that were outstanding as of that time . As a result, the Company consolidates Wolf
Energy
in its condensed consolidated financial statements; however because it is the intent of the Company to distribute these shares in Wolf
Energy
to the stockholders of the Company upon the effectiveness of a registration statement
filed by Wolf
Energy , the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of Wolf
Energy
and the results of operations of Wolf
Energy
in discontinued operations.
See Note 2.
On April 9, 2021, a Little
Rock, Arkansas jury awarded Ecoark and Zest a total of $ 115
million in damages (later reduced to $ 110
million) which includes $ 65
million
in compensatory damages and $ 50
million in punitive damages and found Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) liable on three counts. The
federal jury found that Walmart misappropriated Zest’s trade secrets, failed to comply with a written contract, and acted willfully
and maliciously in misappropriating Zest’s trade secrets. See Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings.

ECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER 31, 2022
Trend Holdings formed four subsidiaries, including
Bitstream Mining, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Bitstream”), on May 16, 2021. In addition, Trend Holdings owned
Barrier Crest, LLC (“Barrier Crest”) which was acquired along with Trend Capital Management, Inc. (“TCM”) which
was acquired by Ecoark Holdings on May 31, 2019. On June 17, 2022, Agora sold Trend Holdings to an entity formed by the investment manager
of Trend Discovery LP and Trend Discovery SPV and sold Trend Discovery Exploration LLC (“Trend Exploration”) to the Company.
See Note 2, “Discontinued Operations”. The Company reclassified the operations of Barrier Crest and TCM, as discontinued operations
as the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results as
of March 31, 2022.
The Company made this determination for these
segments to be held for sale as the criteria established under ASC 205-20-45-1E have been satisfied as of June 8, 2022. Under ASC 855-10-55,
the Company has reflected the reclassification of assets and liabilities of these entities as held for sale and the operations as discontinued
operations as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022. The Company accounted for this sale as a disposal of the business under ASC 205-20-50-1(a)
upon the closing of the sale on June 17, 2022 at which time the gain was recognized.
The Company assigned its membership interest in
Trend Holdings and its related wholly owned subsidiaries to Agora on September 22, 2021, for the sale of the initial 100 shares for $10.
On October 1, 2021, the Company purchased 41,671,121 shares of Agora common stock for $4,167,112 which Agora used to purchase equipment
to commence the Bitstream operations.
Agora was organized by Ecoark Holdings to enter
the Bitcoin mining business. Because of the plunge in the price of Bitcoin in 2022 and the type of miners Agora acquired during its attempt
to close an initial public offering, Agora determined it was not presently feasible to conduct Bitcoin mining operations and ceased such
activities on March 3, 2022. In September 2022, Agora determined to become a power-centric hosting company and thus, subject to raising
capital, will focus its attention on generating revenues in this capacity.
On August 4, 2021, the Company’s common
stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

ECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER 31, 2022
On October 6, 2021, the Company held a Special
Meeting of Stockholders, at which the stockholders approved (a) an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of
shares of authorized common stock of the Company from
30,000,000
shares to
40,000,000
shares; (b) an amendment to the Ecoark Holdings
2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under this plan from
800,000
shares
to
1,300,000
shares; and (c) the issuance of
272,252
restricted stock units and an additional
63,998
restricted stock units to the then
President of Zest Labs and director of the Company under this Plan, in exchange for the cancellation of
672,499
previously issued stock
options.
On September 9, 2022, the Company held an annual
meeting of its stockholders, and the stockholders approved the issuance of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock sold on June 8, 2022. Additionally, the stockholders approved increasing authorized common
stock to
100,000,000
shares. Articles of Amendment were filed that day.
On October 28, 2022, the Company and Ecoark, Inc.
assigned all of its residual intellectual property rights and rights in the Zest Labs lawsuits to Zest Labs in connection with the anticipated
spin-off of Zest Labs common stock to the Company’s stockholders. The Board of Directors subsequently determined not to proceed
with the Zest Labs spin-off, however the assignment was not affected by that determination.
Overview of Agora Digital Holdings, Inc.
Bitstream
Bitstream was organized to be our principal Bitcoin
mining subsidiary. Bitstream entered into a series of agreements and arrangements including arranging for a reliable and economical electric
power source needed to efficiently mine Bitcoin, order miners, housing infrastructure and other infrastructure to mine Bitcoin and locate
a third-party hosting service to operate the miners and the service’s more advanced miners.
As discussed in this Note 1, Agora has refocused its efforts and will
become a power-centric hosting company rather than a Bitcoin mining company and will not hold any Bitcoin in its digital wallets. To that
end, Agora entered into a Master Services Agreement (“MSA”) on December 7, 2022 with BitNile, Inc. (“BitNile”),
whereby BitNile agreed to provide mining equipment which Agora would host at its West Texas location and supply the electricity for the
cryptocurrency mining. The MSA requires Agora to initially provide up to 12MW of electricity at the West Texas site for BitNile’s
use. An additional 66MW of power can be made available to BitNile as well for a total of 78MW. To meet this obligation, the Company is
required to raise at least $ 5,000,000
to enable the build out of the hosting facility, including the initial 12MW of power within 45 days
of the date of the MSA. As of the date of this Report, this requirement has not been met.
All significant accounting policies related to
Pinnacle Frac, Capstone, White River, Shamrock, Barrier Crest and Trend Discovery Capital Management have been removed as these entities
are reflected in discontinued operations. For full details on the policies refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
March 31, 2022 filed on July 7, 2022.
Principles of Consolidation
On May 31, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Trend Discovery Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation for the Company to
acquire
100 % of Trend Discovery Holdings, LLC pursuant to a merger of Trend with and into the Company (the “Merger”). Trend
Discovery Holdings, Inc. ceased doing business upon completion of the merger and Trend Discovery Holdings LLC is the subsidiary of the
Company. Upon the formation of Agora on September 17, 2021, Ecoark assigned the membership interest it owned in Trend Holdings to Agora
on September 22, 2021 when the Company purchased
100
shares of Agora common stock for $ 10 .
On March 27, 2020, the Company and Banner Parent,
entered into the Banner Purchase Agreement to acquire Banner Midstream. Pursuant to the acquisition, Banner Midstream became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company and Banner Parent received shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for all of the issued
and outstanding shares of Banner Midstream. The Company sold all divisions of Banner Midstream in July 2022 and September 2022 as discussed
herein.
The Company applies the guidance of Topic 810
Consolidation
of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries—all
entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest—are consolidated except when control does not rest with the parent.
8
ECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER 31, 2022
Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8, the usual
condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest, and, therefore, as a general rule ownership
by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly, of more than
50
percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition
pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership, for example, by contract, lease,
agreement with other stockholders, or by court decree.
The Company has utilized the guidance under ASC
810-10-55-4B, Case A for a Change that has resulted in the recognition of non-controlling interest. On October 1, 2021, Agora issued restricted
common stock to non-employee directors, management, employees and advisors.
As a result of the restricted common share issuances, the
Company owns now owns less than 100% of Agora (approximately 89%).
The Company expects it will continue to control Agora until it completes
the distribution of Agora common stock to its security holders described above; after that event occurs, it may still have sufficient
equity ownership to control Agora unless one or more third parties acquire a larger equity position.
During the six months ended September 30, 2022,
Agora issued
400,000
shares of common stock to consultants and management.
As a result of these issuances, the Company’s ownership
percentage in Agora dropped from approximately 90% to approximately 89%.
The Company sold both White River and Banner Midstream (Pinnacle/Capstone)
in July and September 2022, respectively. These entities are no longer subsidiaries of the Company. The Company has investments in WTRV
and Wolf
Energy
that represent the shares it received for the sale of these entities. The
investment in WTRV is in non-voting preferred shares, and Management has concluded that the Company is not the primary beneficiary in
this transaction, and thus no consolidation is required for White River as a variable interest entity. The Company currently owns approximately
65 % of the total issued common shares of Wolf
Energy
and has consolidated Wolf
Energy ;
however, the Company expects to distribute these shares to its stockholders of record as of September 30, 2022, and thus has reflected
Wolf
Energy
in the discontinued operations of the Company for the nine months ended December
31, 2022.
Reclassifications
The Company has reclassified certain amounts in
the December 31, 2021 condensed consolidated financial statements to be consistent with the December 31, 2022 presentation, including
the reclassification of Barrier Crest, TCM, White River, Pinnacle Frac, and Capstone assets and liabilities from continuing operations
to held for sale and reclassifications of operations of Barrier Crest, TCM, White River, Pinnacle Frac, and Capstone to discontinued operations.
The March 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet has been reclassified to include the assets and liabilities sold for White River, Pinnacle
Frac, and Capstone as well. Additionally, we have removed all rounding of amounts and shares from the December 31, 2021 presentation to
conform to the December 31, 2022 presentation. These changes had no impact on the Company’s financial position or result of operations
for the periods presented.
Noncontrolling Interests
In accordance with ASC 810-10-45
Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements,
the Company classifies noncontrolling interests as a component of equity within the
consolidated balance sheet. In October 2021 and July 2022, with the issuance of restricted common stock to directors, management and advisors,
the Company no longer owns
100 % of Agora. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, approximately
11 % and
9.1 % is reflected as non-controlling
interest of that entity. In addition, we have reflected
30 % of Wolf
Energy
as noncontrolling
interests as the Company represents approximately
65 % of the voting interests in Wolf
Energy .

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER 31, 2022
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to,
management’s estimate of provisions required for uncollectible accounts receivable, fair value of assets held for sale and assets
and liabilities acquired, impaired value of equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, asset retirement obligations, estimates
of discount rates in lease, liabilities to accrue, fair value of derivative liabilities associated with warrants, cost incurred in the
satisfaction of performance obligations, permanent and temporary differences related to income taxes and determination of the fair value
of stock awards.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The following five steps are applied to achieve
that core principle:
●
Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer
●
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
●
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation
In order to identify the performance obligations
in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or
service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct” good or service (or
bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its
own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct),
and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract
(i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).
If a good or service is not distinct, the good
or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.
The transaction price is the amount of consideration
to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised
in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity
must consider the effects of all of the following:
●
Variable consideration
10
ECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
DECEMBER 31, 2022
●
Constraining estimates of variable consideration
●
The existence of a significant financing component in the contract
●
Noncash consideration
●
Consideration payable to a customer
Variable consideration is included in the transaction
price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur
when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
The transaction price is allocated to each performance
obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price is the price at which the Company would sell a promised
service separately to a customer. The relative selling price for each performance obligation is estimated using observable objective evidence
if it is available. If observable objective evidence is not available, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price for the
promised service. In instances where the Company does not sell a service separately, establishing standalone selling price requires significant
judgment.
The Company estimates the standalone selling price
by considering available information, prioritizing observable inputs such as historical sales, internally approved pricing guidelines
and objectives, and the underlying cost of delivering the performance obligation. The transaction price allocated to each performance
obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.
Management judgment is required when determining
the following: when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal (and hence can be included in revenue); whether
certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs; when a promised service transfers to the customer; and the
applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time.
Although, Agora since March 3, 2022, has not recognized
revenue from its mining operations, prior to this time, it recognized revenue upon satisfaction of its performance obligation over time
in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-27 for its contracts with mining pool operators.
The Company accounts for incremental costs of
obtaining a contract with a customer and contract fulfillment costs in accordance with ASC 340-40,
Other Assets and Deferred Costs .
These costs should be capitalized and amortized as the performance obligation is satisfied if certain criteria are met. The Company elected
the practical expedient, to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period
of the asset that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less, and expenses certain costs to obtain contracts when applicable.
The Company recognizes an asset from the costs to fulfill a contract only if the costs relate directly to a contract, the costs generate
or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying a performance obligation in the future and the costs are expected to be recovered.
The Company recognizes the cost of sales of a contract as expense when incurred or when a performance obligation is satisfied. The incremental
costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized unless the costs would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained,
are not considered recoverable, or the practical expedient applies.

Bitcoin Mining
The discussion here should be understood as being
applicable while Agora was conducting mining operations which it ceased beginning March 3, 2022. On September 16, 2022, the Company determined
to conduct operations as a power-centric hosting company, rather than a Bitcoin mining company. For the past revenue recognition, refer
to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on July 7, 2022.
Hosting Revenues
Agora effective in September 2022 began efforts to
generate revenue via hosting agreements. Agora entered into a MSA on December 7, 2022 with BitNile, whereby BitNile agreed to provide
mining equipment which Agora would host at its West Texas location and supply the electricity for the cryptocurrency mining, subject to
the Company raising $ 5
million to support the hosting operations. See Note 1. “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies . ”
When Agora generates hosting revenues, it will
follow ASC 606 as outlined above and recognize revenue upon the completion of the performance obligations as stipulated under the MSA.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no revenue has been recognized under any hosting agreements.
All Bitcoin that is mined under these arrangements
will be transmitted directly into the third-party digital wallets and the Company will not hold any Bitcoin in its accounts.
Accounts Receivable and Concentration of
Credit Risk
The Company considers accounts receivable, net
of allowance for doubtful accounts, to be fully collectible. The allowance is based on management’s estimate of the overall collectability
of accounts receivable, considering historical losses, credit insurance and economic conditions. Based on these same factors, individual
accounts are charged off against the allowance when management determines those individual accounts are uncollectible. Credit extended
to customers is generally uncollateralized, however credit insurance is obtained for some customers. Past-due status is based on contractual
terms.
Fair Value Measurements
ASC 820
Fair Value Measurements
defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”),
and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy:
Level 1 inputs: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 inputs: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 inputs: Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.
The carrying values of the Company’s financial
instruments such as cash, investments, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their respective fair values
because of the short-term nature of those financial instruments.
Bitcoin assets will be presented in current assets.
Fair value will be determined by taking the price of the coins from the trading platforms which Agora will most frequently use.

Bitcoin
Prior to March 3, 2022 when the Company was mining
Bitcoin, it included the Bitcoin in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Bitcoin was recorded at cost less impairment. For the past Bitcoin accounting policies, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed on July 7, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company neither owns nor mines any Bitcoin.

to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Segment Information
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 280-10  Segment Reporting.  The
Company classified its reporting segments in these three divisions through March 31, 2022, when the Company determined that pursuant to
ASC 205-20-45-1E that the operations related to the Financial Services segment would be reclassified as held for sale as those criteria
identified in the pronouncement had been satisfied as of June 8, 2022. Under ASC 855-10-55, the Company has reflected the reclassification
of assets and liabilities of these entities as held for sale and the operations as discontinued operations as of and for the year ended
March 31, 2022. As a result of this reclassification, the Company’s segment reporting has removed the Financing segment for the
nine months ended December 31, 2021. Effective April 1, 2022, the Company has classified its segments in the Commodity Segment, Technology
Segment and Bitcoin Mining Segment. It now charges a monthly overhead charge to the Technology Segment and to the Transportation component
and Oil and Gas Production component (each part of the Commodities Segment). On July 25, 2022, the Company sold its oil and gas production
business (White River) which is part of the Commodities segment, and on September 7, 2022, the Company sold the remaining part (Pinnacle
Frac and Capstone) of the Commodities Segment. Under ASC 855-10-55, the Company has reflected the sale of these entities and the operations
as discontinued operations as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. As a result of the share exchanges involving White River
and Wolf Energy, and the immaterial nature of the operations of Zest Labs, the Company no longer segregates its operations as most of
the limited continuing operations are related to Agora.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) include additional
dilution from common stock equivalents, such as convertible notes, preferred stock, stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options
and warrants.
Common stock equivalents are not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share when the Company reports a loss because to do so would be anti-dilutive for periods presented,
so only the basic weighted average number of common shares are used in the computations.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company does not currently use derivative
instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. Management evaluates all of the Company’s financial
instruments, including warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
The Company generally uses a Black-Scholes model, as applicable, to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation
dates when needed. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is re-measured at the end of each reporting period. The Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the fair value of the derivative
liabilities.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options
(Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments
and Contract’s in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation
models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument
with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity
contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU simplifies
the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas.

DECEMBER 31, 2022
The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 31, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2021-04 “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic

(Subtopic 815- 40) Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options”
which clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified
written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An entity should measure the
effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification
or exchange as follows: i) for a modification or an exchange that is a part of or directly related to a modification or an exchange of
an existing debt instrument or line-of-credit or revolving-debt arrangements (hereinafter, referred to as a “debt” or “debt
instrument”), as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option and the fair value of that
written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged; ii) for all other modifications or exchanges, as the excess, if any,
of the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option over the fair value of that written call option immediately before
it is modified or exchanged. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges
occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company does not believe this new guidance will have a material impact
on its consolidated financial statements.
The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements
that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.
Liquidity
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, the Company had a net (loss) income to controlling interest of common stockholders of $( 30,389,490 ) and $ 1,304,848 , respectively,
has working capital (deficit) of $ 21,072,036
and $( 8,394,850 ) as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively, and has an accumulated
deficit as of December 31, 2022 of $( 157,440,304 ). As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $ 32,642
in cash and cash equivalents. The
working capital at December 31, 2022 is the direct result of the investment in WTRV valued at $ 30,000,000 . This positive working capital
is based upon Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and should not be viewed as reflecting available cash or other short term assets.
These represent the value of the
1,200
shares of Series A that are expected to be distributed to the Company’s stockholders, as
discussed in Note 5.
The Company’s
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) applicable
to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company sold its interests in Banner Midstream in two separate transactions on July 25, 2022 and September 7, 2022. In addition, it sold
the non-core business of Trend Discovery on June 17, 2022. The Company expects to distribute the common stock it received (or issuable
upon conversion of preferred stock) in the sales to its stockholders upon the effective registration statements for the two entities the
companies were sold to. See Note 13, “Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock” for information on the Company’s
recent $ 12
million convertible preferred stock financing. That financing has restrictive covenants that require approval of the investor
for the Company to engage in any equity or debt financing.
The Company
believes that the current cash on hand is not sufficient to conduct planned operations for one year from the issuance of the consolidated
financial statements, and it needs to raise capital to support their operations. The Company has recently established a potential source
of revenue upon entering into the MSA with BitNile If revenue is generated from the MSA, management expects that it will go towards covering
the Company’s operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. However, in order to proceed under the MSA, the Company
will require additional financing to fund its future planned operations. Under the terms of the MSA, the Company was required to raise
a minimum of $ 5,000,000
by January 21, 2023, although the parties have verbally agreed to extend that deadline. Based on the Company’s
relationship with Ault alliance, Inc. (“Ault”) which is described in this Report, the Company expects Ault will not terminate
the MSA, although it could elect to do so for any reason whether related to the Company or Ault. See Note 20. “Subsequent Events”
concerning a significant pending transaction with Ault.
The MSA contemplates the Company providing services and infrastructure
to BitNile to enable the build out of the hosting facility, including the initial 12MW of power within 45 days of the date of the MSA
which as disclosed above was not met. We have generated no revenue to date under any hosting arrangement.
The
accompanying financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2022 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going
concern, but the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund
operating losses until it establishes continued revenue streams and becomes profitable. Management’s plans to continue as a going
concern include raising additional capital through sales of equity securities and borrowing. However, management cannot provide any assurances
that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. If the Company is not able to obtain the necessary additional financing
on a timely basis, the Company will be required to delay, reduce or perhaps even cease the operation of its business. The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully secure other sources of financing and attain profitable
operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is
unable to continue as a going concern.

Impact of COVID-19
COVID-19 may continue to affect the economy and
the industries in which we operate, depending on the vaccine and booster rollouts and the emergence of virus mutations.
COVID-19 did not have a material effect on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 or year ended March
31, 2022 in contrast to the material impact it had in the prior fiscal year.
COVID-19 has also contributed to the supply chain
disruptions which have not yet had a material effect for the Company. The Company will continue to monitor the supply chain shortages
affecting its business.
The extent to which COVID-19 may impact the Company’s
results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge
concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (“CARES Act”) includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss
carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property.
The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), whereby certain small businesses are eligible for a
loan to fund payroll expenses, rent and related costs. We had received funding under the PPP, and a majority of that has been forgiven.
NOTE 2: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On June
17 ,
2022, the Company sold Trend Discovery to an entity formed by the investment manager of Trend Discovery LP and Trend Discovery SPV for
a three-year $ 4,250,000
secured note (see Note 4). Each of the Trend Discovery subsidiaries including Barrier Crest guaranteed the note
and provided Agora with a first lien on its assets. The Company accounted for this sale as a disposal of the business under ASC 205-20-50-1(a).
The Company had reclassified the operations of Barrier Crest and Trend Discovery Capital Management (the other entities were inactive)
as discontinued operations as the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations
and financial results. The Company made this determination for these segments to be held for sale as the criteria established under ASC
205-20-45-1E had been satisfied as of June 8, 2022. Under ASC 855-10-55, the Company has reflected the reclassification of assets and
liabilities of these entities as held for sale and the operations as discontinued operations as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022
as well as for the period April 1, 2022 through June 17, 2022. The Company accounted for this sale as a disposal of the business under
ASC 205-20-50-1(a) on June 17, 2022 at which time the gain was recognized. As a result of this reclassification, the Company identified
the following assets and liabilities that were reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations as they are discontinued.
On July 25, 2022, the Company sold its oil and
gas production business (White River) which is part of the Commodities segment. The Company has reflected the reclassification of assets
and liabilities of these entities discontinued operations as of and for the period April 1, 2022 through July 31, 2022. The Company used
July 31, 2022 as a cut-off as a majority of its revenue and expenses are billed on a monthly basis and it is more convenient to do so.
On September 7, 2022, the Company sold its transportation
business (Pinnacle Frac and Capstone) which is part of the Commodities segment. The Company has reflected the reclassification of assets
and liabilities of these entities discontinued operations as of and for the period April 1, 2022 through August 31, 2022. The Company
used August 31, 2022 as a cut-off as a majority of its revenue and expenses are billed on a monthly basis and it is more convenient to
do so. The shares the Company were issued by Wolf
Energy
represent approximately
70 % of the
total voting shares of Wolf
Energy . As a result, the Company will consolidate Wolf
Energy
in the condensed consolidated financial statements. It is the intent of the Company to distribute these shares in Wolf
Energy
to the stockholders of the Company upon the effectiveness of a registration statement filed by Wolf
Energy .
Therefore, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of Wolf
Energy
and the results
of operations of Wolf
Energy
in discontinued operations.

NOTE 3: REVENUE
The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers
promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those services.
In the nine months ended December 31, 2022 the Company recognized no revenue and for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company
recognized revenue from continuing operations related to their Bitcoin mining operations in the amount of $ 17,455 .
Bitcoin Mining
Prior to March 3, 2022, the Company recognized
revenue for Bitcoin mining as follows:
Providing computing power to solve complex cryptographic
algorithms in support of Bitcoin blockchains, in a process known as “solving a block”, is an output of the Company’s
ordinary activities. The provision of computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining
pool operators, its customers. When the Company engaged in mining, satisfied its performance obligation over time as it provides computing
power.
The contract term is short, limited to the period
of time the Company’s miners were contributing to the mining pool computational operations in support of the blockchain, measured
in “hash rate” or “hashes per second”. The contract term was the payout period under the Company’s mining
pool contracts, which is a twenty-four-hour period. After each contract period, the Company had the right to renew the contract for subsequent,
successive payout periods.
Bitcoin received in exchange for providing computing
power represents noncash consideration. The fair value of the noncash consideration determined at contract inception was recognized in
revenue as the Company performed over the contract term using an output method based on hash rate contributed. Changes in the fair value
of the noncash consideration post-contract consideration due to reasons other than form of consideration (that is, other than the price
of bitcoin or ether) were estimated under the expected value method but constrained from inclusion in the transaction price (and hence
revenue) until end of the contract term when the uncertainty has been resolved and amount was known.
The Company received payment for its provision
of hash rate under the Pay-Per-Shares-Plus (“PPS+”) payment method. The payment method contains two components, (1) the block
rewards issued by the blockchain network and paid by the mining pool operator, and (2) transaction fees generated from (paid by) blockchain
users and distributed (paid out) to individual miners by the mining pool operator. The pool, as a collective entity, develops its own
technology that, on one end, gathers individual miner’s hash rate, and on the other end contributes hash rate to the network to
compete for block rewards from the network.
For PPS+, as long as individual miners contribute
hash rate to the pool, the Company (as an individual miner) is entitled to receive its corresponding amount of block rewards based on
the mining pool’s calculation methodology, which is standard across pool operators.
Block rewards are the new coins awarded to Bitcoin
miners by the network (bitcoin for the bitcoin network) and is a theoretical number calculated by the mining pool operator based on inputs
including difficulty level, network hash rate, and block rewards (for example, 6.25 for Bitcoin). Transaction fees refers to the total
fees paid by users of the network to execute transactions.
Digital asset transaction fees are payable to
the mining pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool and are deducted from the block reward payout. This fee was deducted
from the block reward the Company received and recorded as a reduction of revenue because it does not represent payment for a distinct
good or service.
Effective September 16, 2022, Agora commenced
efforts to become a power-centric hosting company and if it becomes operational it will recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 606.

for the acquisition of Trend Discovery Holdings. The Trend Ventures Note is in the principal amount of $ 4,250,000 , bears interest at the
rate of
5 % per annum, and matures
June 16, 2025 . Under Trend Ventures Note, Trend Ventures, LP has agreed to make interest-only payments,
in arrears on a monthly basis commencing on June 30, 2022 and continuing thereafter until June 16, 2023. Beginning on June 30, 2023, Trend
Ventures, LP agreed to make 24 consecutive equal monthly payments of principal each in an amount which would fully amortize the principal,
plus accrued interest. All principal and any unpaid accrued interest will be due and payable on or before the maturity date. The Trend
Ventures Note will be granted a first lien senior secured interest as set forth in the Security Agreement executed on the same date as
the Trend Ventures Note, by and among Trend Ventures, LP, its future subsidiaries (each a Guarantor) and Agora dated as of June 16, 2022.
Trend has not made any interest payments on the Note.

NOTE 5: INVESTMENT – SERIES A CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK – WHITE RIVER ENERGY CORP
On July 25, 2022, the Company entered into a Share
Exchange Agreement pursuant to which that day it sold to WTRV its oil and gas production business (White River) which is part of the Commodities
segment. The Company received
1,200
shares of WTRV’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which becomes convertible into
42,253,521
shares of WTRV common stock upon such time as (A) WTRV has filed a Form S-1 with the SEC and such Form S-1 has been declared effective,
or is no longer subject to comments from the Staff of the SEC, and (B) Ecoark elects to distribute shares of its common stock to its stockholders.
Based on the lower of cost or market, the value of the investment was determined to be $ 30,000,000 . As of December 31, 2022, WTRV has
not filed a registration statement. The Company has determined that as of December 31, 2022, there is no impairment of this investment.
The Company has treated the investment as a Level 3 asset and that the fair value of the investment exceeds the cost basis which thereby
implies no impairment as of December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has determined
that Ecoark is not the primary beneficiary, and this transaction has not resulted in Ecoark controlling WTRV as the preferred shares are
unable to be converted until the effectiveness of the registration statement being filed for WTRV, does not have the power to direct activities
of WTRV, control the Board of Directors of WTRV and WTRV is not reliant upon funding by Ecoark moving forward.
NOTE 6: INVESTMENT – COMMON STOCK –
WOLF ENERGY SERVICES, INC.
On August
23, 2022 the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Wolf Energy and Banner Midstream. Pursuant
to the Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company acquired

shares of the Wolf Energy
common stock in exchange for all of the capital stock of Banner Midstream owned by the Company, which represents
100 % of the issued and
outstanding shares (the “Exchange”). Following the closing of the Agreement which occurred on September 7, 2022, Banner Midstream
continues as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wolf Energy. Based on the lower of cost or market, the value of the investment was determined

On September 7, 2022, the Exchange was completed, and Banner Midstream became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wolf
Energy . The Company has determined that as of December 31, 2022, there is no impairment of
this investment.
The
Company has determined that this transaction has resulted in Ecoark having a controlling interest in Wolf
Energy
as the common stock issued represent approximately
65 % of the voting common stock of Wolf
Energy
common stock outstanding at December 31, 2022.
Since Ecoark will be distributing to the Ecoark stockholders a stock dividend to
all common and preferred stockholders with a stock dividend date of December 31, 2022, the Company has reflected Wolf
Energy ,
in discontinued operations as the Company intends to hold no shares and thus no voting interest upon the effectiveness of a registration
statement for Wolf
Energy , and the investment has been eliminated in the consolidation.

NOTE 9: POWER DEVELOPMENT COST
Agora has paid $ 1,000,000
each under two separate
agreements for two different land sites to a non-related third party for a total of $ 2,000,000
in connection with the commencement of
Bitstream’s Bitcoin mining operations. The payments represent the fee for securing 48 MW and 30 MW, respectively of utility capacity
as defined and agreed by ERCOT West Load Zone in the Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (“Utility”) at the “one-span”
tariff rate classification of “6.1.1.1.5 Primary greater than 10kw”. If the Utility is unable to deliver these terms as defined
in the facilities extension agreement, the non-related third party is obligated to secure a new location for Bitstream with at least the
stated capacity and same rate tariff. The non-related third party secured the 48 MW and 30 MW of available capacity by signing a distribution
facilities extension agreement with the Utility and posting the required collateral.
The $ 2,000,000
was used to purchase this right
to the distribution facilities extension agreement which gives Bitstream immediate access to the 78 MW electric capacity from the Utility.
Bitstream also reimbursed the utility deposits
paid by the non-related third party in connection with these agreements in the amount of $ 96,000
and $ 326,500 , respectively. The power
development fees are deemed non-refundable unless the non-related third party cannot find a suitable location within 6 months. Bitstream
and the non-related third party are still negotiating a definitive power agreement.
On August 10, 2022, the Company had $ 844,708
returned
from one of the distribution facilities extension agreements, which is net of $ 155,292
of fees related to development costs paid to our
power broker. As a result, $ 1,000,000
remains as an asset as of December 31, 2022.
The Company has classified these payments as “Power
Development Costs” as a noncurrent asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
NOTE 10: WARRANT DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
The Company issued common stock and warrants in
several private placements and two public offerings (“Derivative Warrant Instruments”) and some of these warrants have been
classified as liabilities. The Derivative Warrant Instruments have been accounted for utilizing ASC 815  “Derivatives and
Hedging.”  The Company has incurred a liability for the estimated fair value of Derivative Warrant Instruments. The estimated
fair value of the Derivative Warrant Instruments has been calculated using the Black-Scholes fair value option-pricing model with key
input variables provided by management, as of the date of issuance, with changes in fair value recorded as gains or losses on revaluation
in other income (expense).
The Company identified embedded features in some
of the warrant agreements which were classified as a liability. These embedded features included (a) the implicit right for the holders
to request that the Company settle the warrants in registered shares. Since maintaining an effective registration of shares is potentially
outside the control of the Company, these warrants were classified as liabilities as opposed to equity; (b) included the right for the
holders to request that the Company cash settle the warrant instruments from the holder by paying to the holder an amount of cash equal
to the Black-Scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of the Derivative Warrant Instruments on the date of the consummation
of a fundamental transaction; and (c) certain price protections in the agreements. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments
requires that the Company treat the whole instrument as liability and record the fair value of the instrument as derivatives as of the
inception date of the instrument and to adjust the fair value of the instrument as of each subsequent balance sheet date.

The Company determined our derivative liabilities
to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value as of December 31, 2022 and
2021. The Black-Scholes model requires six basic data inputs: the exercise or strike price, time to expiration, the risk-free interest
rate, the current stock price, the estimated volatility of the stock price in the future, and the dividend rate.

NOTE 13: SERIES A CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED
STOCK
On June 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Ault Lending, LLC (formerly Digital Power Lending, LLC), a California limited liability
company (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Company sold the Purchaser
1,200
shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock (the “Ecoark Series A”),
102,881
shares of common stock (the “Commitment Shares”) and a warrant
to purchase shares of common stock (the “Warrant,” and together with the Ecoark Series A and the Commitment Shares, the “Securities”)
for a total original purchase price of $ 12,000,000 . The Purchaser is a subsidiary of Ault Alliance, Inc. [NYSE American: AULT]. The Company
determined that the classification of the Ecoark Series A was Mezzanine Equity as the option to convert the shares belongs to the Purchaser.
A description of the material transaction components are as follows:
Ecoark Series A
Conversion Rights
Prior to the November 2022 amendment described
below, each share of Ecoark Series A had a stated value of $ 10,000
and were convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price
of $ 2.10
per share, subject to customary adjustment provisions. The holder’s conversion of the Ecoark Series A was subject to a
beneficial ownership limitation of
19.9 % of the issued and outstanding common stock as of any conversion date of the Ecoark Series A,
unless and until the Company obtains stockholder and The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) approval for the conversion of more
than that amount, in order to comply with Nasdaq Rules. Stockholder approval was obtained on September 9, 2022. In addition, the conversion
rights in general did not become effective until July 23, 2022, which is one day after the record date for the stockholders meeting seeking
such stockholder approval at the September 9, 2022 meeting.
The shares of Ecoark Series A as amended are also subject to a 4.99%
beneficial ownership limitation, which may be increased to up to 9.9% by the holder by giving 61 days’ notice to the Company.
On November 28, 2022, the Company, following an
agreement with the Purchaser, the Company amended the Certificate of Designations of Rights, Preferences and Limitations (the “Certificate”)
of the Ecoark Series A previously issued to the Purchaser to: (i) increase the stated value of the Ecoark Series A from $10,000 to $10,833.33;
(ii) provide for the dividends payable under the Ecoark Series A to be payable in common stock rather than cash effective November 1,
2022, and (iii) reduce the conversion price of the Ecoark Series A from $2.10 to the lesser of (a) $1.00 or (b) the higher of (1) 80%
of the 10-day daily volume weighted average price, or (2) $0.25. The amendment on November 28, 2022 constituted a modification to the
classification of the Series A from mezzanine equity to liability. The Company determined in accordance with ASC 470-50-40, that the amendment
would be accounted for as a debt modification as opposed to a debt extinguishment as the amendment did not meet the 10% threshold when
comparing the present value of the remaining cash flows to the value to the original terms of the Series A. As a result of this modification,
the Company recognized a debt modification expense of $879,368. Upon reclassification to preferred stock liability, the Company analyzed
the terms and determined that the preferred stock liability was considered a derivative liability and measured the derivative liability
at inception (November 28, 2022). This measurement resulted in a gain of $2,878,345.
As described in Note 15 . “ Commitments
and Contingencies”, Nasdaq is alleging that the November 2022 amendment to the Series A violated its voting and stockholder approval
requirements, and we expect it may do so with regard to the recent BitNile.com transaction, although the Company plans to seek stockholder
approval for both transactions and make any modifications Nasdaq requires. See “Risk Factors” contained in this Report.
Changes to these inputs could produce a significantly
higher or lower fair value measurement. The fair value of the preferred stock liability is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation
model. The following assumptions were used on December 31, 2022, and at inception:

Warrant
Prior to its cancellation, the Warrant, as amended,
provided the Purchaser or its assignees (the “Holder”) with the right to purchase a number of shares of common stock as would
enable the holder together with its affiliates to beneficially own 49% of the Company’s common stock, calculated on a fully diluted
basis, at an exercise price of $0.001 per share, including the Commitment Shares and Conversion Shares unless sold. Subject to stockholder
approval, the Warrant was to vest and become exercisable into shares of the Company’s stock if as of June 8, 2024: (i) the Company
had failed to complete the distributions to the Company’s security holders or to any other subsidiary of the Company’s equity
ownership of its three principal subsidiaries: Agora, Banner Midstream and Zest Labs (or their principal subsidiaries) (the “Distributions”),
and/or (ii) the Holder together with its affiliates does not beneficially own at least 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
Provided, the Company must retain 20% of its common stock of Agora. The Warrant was to be exercised on a cashless basis and expire on
June 8, 2027.
On November 14, 2022,
the Company and the warrant
holder canceled the warrant which was originally issued to the holder on June 8, 2022, as subsequently amended and restated, in exchange
for $100 as the Company has substantially met the conditions under Section 1(a) of the warrant , therefore, the Company did not compute
any derivative liability on the warrants.

Legal Proceedings
We are presently involved in the following legal
proceedings. To the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party or to which
any of our properties or businesses are subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
● On August 1, 2018, Ecoark and Zest Labs filed a complaint against Walmart Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Western Division. The complaint includes claims for violation of the Arkansas Trade Secrets Act, violation of the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act, breach of contract, unfair competition, unjust enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion and fraud. On April 9, 2021, a Little Rock, Arkansas jury awarded Ecoark and Zest Labs a total of $ 115
million in damages (subsequently reduced to $ 110
million) which includes $ 65
million in compensatory damages (subsequently reduced to $ 60
million) and $ 50
million in punitive damages and found Walmart Inc. liable on three claims. The federal jury found that Walmart Inc. misappropriated Zest Labs’ trade secrets, failed to comply with a written contract, and acted willfully and maliciously in misappropriating Zest Labs’ trade secrets. We expect Walmart to continue to vigorously defend the litigation and to oppose the verdict in post-trial motions and an appeal. The Company has filed post-trial motions to add an award for its attorneys’ fees as the prevailing party in the litigation. In addition to other post-trial motions, Walmart, Inc. has filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for remittitur or a new trial. As of the date of this Report, the court has allowed post-trial discovery but has not ruled on the motion for new trial.
● On September 21, 2021,
Ecoark Holdings and Zest Labs filed a complaint against Deloitte Consulting, LLP (“Deloitte”) in the Eight Judicial
District Court in Clark County, Nevada. The complaint is for violation of the Nevada Uniform Trade Secret Act and will also be
seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction, attorney’s fees, and punitive damages. Zest Labs began working with Deloitte
in 2016, in a confidential matter in a pilot program that Zest Labs had been engaged for by Walmart. Zest Labs engaged in
significant discussions, presentations, demonstrations, and information downloads with Deloitte who specifically acknowledged that
this information was confidential. Deloitte’s motion to dismiss was denied, it filed an answer denying substantive allegations
and the parties are engaging in discovery. The Company cannot reasonably determine the outcome and potential reward at this
time.
● On
April 22, 2022, BitStream Mining and Ecoark Holdings were sued in Travis County, Texas District Court (Docket #79176-0002) by Print Crypto
Inc. in the amount of $ 256,733.28
for failure to pay for equipment purchased to operate BitStream Mining’s Bitcoin mining operation.
The defendants intend to vigorously defend themselves and have filed counterclaims in the 353 rd
Judicial District in Travis
County, Texas on May 6, 2022 for fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, and for payment of attorney’s fees and costs. The Company
provided additional documents to our attorneys on October 7, 2022, and there is no update since then. The Company has accrued the full
amount of the claim in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.
● On July 15, 2022, BitStream Mining and two of their Management were
parties to a petition filed in Ward County District Court by 1155 Distributor Partners-Austin, LLC d/b/a Lonestar Electric Supply in the
amount of $ 414,026.83
for failure to pay for equipment purchased to operate the Company’s Bitcoin mining operation. The Company
filed a petition to remove one of its Management from the claim in December 2022, and there is no update since then. The Company has accrued
the full amount of the claim in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.
● On October 17, 2022, BitStream Mining was a party to a petition filed
in Ward County District Court by VA Electrical Contractors, LLC in the amount of $ 1,666,187.18
for failure to pay for equipment purchased
to operate the Company’s Bitcoin mining operation. The Company’s registered agent was served with this lawsuit on January
3, 2023, the Company answered the claim in January, and is in process of supplying documents for discovery. The Company has accrued the
full amount of the claim in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.
In the opinion of management, there are no legal
matters involving us that would have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

DECEMBER 31, 2022
Nasdaq Compliance
On December 27, 2022,
the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company of its noncompliance with stockholder approval requirements set forth
in Listing Rule 5635(d), which requires stockholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving the issuance of
20% or more of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the Minimum Price (as defined therein). Additionally, the letter indicates
that the Company violated Nasdaq’s voting rights rule set forth in Listing Rule 5640. The matters described in the letter relate
to an amendment to the Certificate of Designation of Rights, Preferences and Limitations (the “Certificate”) of the Series
A, shares of which were issued by the Company on June 8, 2022 in a private placement transaction which was previously disclosed on a Current
Report on Form 8-K filed on June 9, 2022. Specifically, the Company amended the Certificate on November 28, 2022 to: (i) increase the
stated value of the Series A from $10,000 to $10,833.33; (ii) provide for the dividends payable under the Series A to be payable in Common
Stock rather than cash effective beginning November 1, 2022, and (iii) reduce the conversion price of the Series A from $2.10 to the lesser
of (1) $1.00 and (2) the higher of (A) 80% of the 10-day daily volume weighted average price and (B) $0.25 (the “Amendment”).
According to the letter, the Company was required to obtain stockholder approval to effect the Amendment because the Series A as amended
provides for the potential issuance of 51,999,984 shares of Common Stock at less than the Minimum Price under Listing Rule 5635(d), and
the Amendment also violates Listing Rule 5640 by providing the holder of the Series A with voting rights on an as-converted basis with
the Series A convertible into Common Stock at a discount, thereby violating Listing Rule 5640.
In the letter, the Company
was provided 45 calendar days from the date of the letter, or until February 10, 2023, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the
referenced Listing Rules, and if such plan is accepted by Nasdaq, the Company can receive an extension of up to 180 calendar days from
the date of the letter to evidence compliance. However, if the Company’s plan is not accepted by Nasdaq, or is not sufficiently
executed to regain compliance and remedy the matters set forth in the letter, the Company’s Common Stock will be subject to delisting.
In connection with the letter the Company was also requested certain documents and information related to its sale of White River.
In connection with the
December 27 th
letter, the Company was also requested to provide certain documents and information related to its sale of White
River, including as it pertains to the $ 30,000,000
in preferred stock value being carried on the Company’s balance sheet as consideration
for the sale of the entity. According to the correspondence, the request was made under Listing Rule 5250 which provides that a listed
company will provide Nasdaq with requested information deemed necessary to make a determination regarding such company’s continued
listing.
Further, on December
30, 2022, the Company received another letter from the Nasdaq notifying the Company of its noncompliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)
by failing to maintain a minimum bid price for its Common Stock of at least $ 1.00
per share for 30 consecutive business days and providing
the Company with a 180 calendar day grace period to regain compliance with the Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), subject to a potential 180 calendar
day extension, as described below. To regain compliance, the Company’s Common Stock must have a minimum closing bid price of at
least $ 1.00
per share for at least 10 consecutive business days within the grace period which ends on June 28, 2023. To qualify for the
additional grace period, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of its publicly held
shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will
need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second grace period, by effecting a reverse stock split
if necessary, which would also require stockholder approval unless completed with a proportionate reduction in our authorized Common Stock
under our Articles of Incorporation.
On January 26, 2023,
Nasdaq sent an email to the Company raising 13 questions concerning the White River transaction, White River’s business, seeking
verification that the Company had in fact transferred $ 3
million to White River last July and questioning the time allocations of the
two senior executive officers of the Company and White River, among other things. The Company responded on February 15, 2023.
The Company provided responses to Nasdaq on January 11, 2023, February
10, 2023 and February 15, 2023. As of the date of this Report, the Company has not heard back from Nasdaq.
If
our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:
● a
risk that Ault may refuse to close the proposed BitNile.com transaction;
●
it may adversely affect the Company’s ability to raise capital which it needs to stay operational;
● a limited availability of market quotations for our Common
Stock;
● reduced
liquidity with respect to our Common Stock;

● a determination that our shares of Common Stock are a “penny
stock” which will require broker-dealers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a
reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our Common Stock; and
If we are unable to rectify any of the above-described
Nasdaq issues, for failure to timely obtain stockholder approval, a delisting will subject us and our stockholders to the above and other
adverse consequences, and could also delay us from effecting the announced spin-offs of common stock of White River and Wolf Energy certain
entities as described elsewhere in this Report. See “Risk Factors” contained elsewhere in this Report.
NOTE 16: CONCENTRATIONS
The Company occasionally maintains cash balances
in excess of the FDIC insured limit. The Company does not consider this risk to be material.
NOTE
17: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company measures and discloses the estimated
fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The fair value hierarchy has three levels, which are based on reliable available inputs of observable data. The hierarchy requires the
use of observable market data when available. The three-level hierarchy is defined as follows:
Level 1 – quoted prices for identical
instruments in active markets;
Level 2 – quoted prices for similar
instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations
in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
Level 3 – fair value measurements
derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
Financial instruments consist principally of cash,
prepaid expenses, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. The
fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs. There were no transfers into or out of “Level 3” during the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate its current fair values because
of its nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point
in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature
and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions
could significantly affect the estimates. The Company records the fair value of the of the warrant derivative liabilities disclosed in
accordance with ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging . The fair values of the derivatives were calculated using the Black-Scholes Model.
The fair value of the derivative liabilities is revalued on each balance sheet date with corresponding gains and losses recorded in other
income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. The following table presents assets and liabilities that are measured
and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis as of:

acquired a right of use asset and lease liability on March 27, 2020. The Company recorded these amounts at present value, in accordance
with the standard, using a discount rate of
5 %.
The right of use asset is composed of the sum of all lease payments, at present value,
and is amortized straight line over the life of the expected lease term. For the expected term of the lease the Company used the initial
terms ranging between 24 and 60 months.
Upon the election by the Company to extend the lease for additional years, that election will
be treated as a lease modification and the lease will be reviewed for re-measurement.
The Company has chosen to implement this standard
using the modified retrospective model approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment, which does not require the Company to adjust the
comparative periods presented when transitioning to the new guidance. The Company has also elected to utilize the transition related practical
expedients permitted by the new standard. The modified retrospective approach provides a method for recording existing leases at adoption
and in comparative periods that approximates the results of a modified retrospective approach. Adoption of the new standard did not result
in an adjustment to retained earnings for the Company.
As of December 31, 2022, the value of the unamortized
lease right of use asset is $ 370,315
(through maturity at October 31, 2026). As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s lease liability
was $ 376,280 .

20: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company had
the following transactions:
On January 24, 2023,
the Company entered into an At-The-Market (“ATM”) Issuance Sales Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Ascendiant Capital
Markets, LLC (“Ascendiant”), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell from time to time, through Ascendiant, shares
of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 0.001
per share (the “Shares”), with offering proceeds of up to $ 3,500,000 .
Sales of the Shares,
if any, may be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at-the-market” offering as defined in Rule 415 of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), including without limitation sales made directly on or through The Nasdaq Capital
Market, the trading market for the Company’s common stock, on any other existing trading market in the United States for the Company’s
common stock, to or through a market maker, directly to Ascendiant as principal for its account in negotiated transactions at market prices
prevailing at the time of sale or at prices related to such prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades,
or through a combination of any such methods of sale. Ascendiant will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell on the Company’s
behalf all of the Shares requested to be sold by the Company, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, subject to the terms
of the Agreement.
Under the Agreement, Ascendiant will be entitled to compensation of 3% of the gross proceeds from the sales of the Shares
sold under the Agreement. The Company also agreed to reimburse Ascendiant for certain specified expenses, including the fees and disbursements
of its legal counsel, in an amount not to exceed $30,000 as well as up to $2,500 for each quarterly and annual bring-down while the Agreement
is ongoing.
The Shares are being
offered and sold pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January
24, 2023 and the accompanying base prospectus which is part of the Company’s effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File
No. 333-249532) (the “Registration Statement”). As of February 17, 2023, the Company had sold
1,425,928
shares and received
$ 475,623
in net proceeds.
The Agreement contains
representations, warranties and covenants customary for the transactions of this kind.
The Company has allocated
7,500,000
shares of common stock to be sold as of February 10, 2023 under the Ascendiant ATM.
On January 23, 2023,
the Series A holder agreed to reduce its secondary offering of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A by
$ 3,500,000
in connection with the ATM offering.
The Company issued
710,430
shares of common stock for the December
2022 and January 2023 preferred stock dividend payments to Ault.
On February 8, 2023,
the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “SEA”) by and among Ault Alliance, Inc. (“Ault”), the
owner of approximately 86% of BitNile.com, Inc. (“BitNile.com”), and the minority stockholders of BitNile.com (the “Minority
Shareholders”). The SEA provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Company will acquire all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of BitNile.com as well as the common stock of Earnity, Inc. beneficially owned by BitNile.com (which
represents approximately 19.9% of the outstanding common stock of Earnity, Inc. as of the date of the SEA), in exchange for the following:
(i) 8,637.5 shares of newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company to be issued to Ault (the “Series B”),
and (ii) 1,362.5 shares of newly designated Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company to be issued to the to the Minority Shareholders
(the “Series C,” and together with the Series B, the “Preferred Stock”). The Series B and the Series C, the terms
of which are summarized in more detail below, each have a stated value of $10,000 per share (the “Stated Value”), for a combined
stated value of $100,000,000, and subject to adjustment are convertible into a total of up to 400,000,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock, which represent approximately 92.4% of the Company outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis.
The terms of the Series
B and Series C as set forth in the Certificates of Designations of the Rights, Preferences and Limitations of each such series of Preferred
Stock (each, a “Certificate,” and together the “Certificates”) are essentially identical except the Series B is
super voting and must approve any modification of various negative covenants and certain other corporate actions as more particularly
described below.
Pursuant to the Series
B Certificate, each share of Series B is convertible into a number of shares of the Company’s common stock determined by dividing
the Stated Value by $ 0.25 , or
40,000
shares of common stock. The conversion price is subject to certain adjustments, including potential
downward adjustment if the Company closes a qualified financing resulting in at least $ 25,000,000
in gross proceeds at a price per share
that is lower than the conversion price. The Series B holders are entitled to receive dividends at a rate of
5 % of the Stated Value per
annum from issuance until
February 7, 2033
(the “Dividend Term”). During the first
two years
of the Dividend Term, dividends
will be payable in additional shares of Series B rather than cash, and thereafter dividends will be payable in either additional shares
of Series B or cash as each holder may elect. If the Company fails to make a dividend payment as required by the Series B Certificate,
the dividend rate will be increased to
12 % for as long as such default remains ongoing and uncured. Each share of Series B also has an
$ 11,000
liquidation preference in the event of a liquidation, change of control event, dissolution or winding up of the Company, and ranks
senior to all other capital stock of the Company with respect thereto other than the Series C with which the Series B shares equal ranking.
Each share of Series B is entitled to vote with the Company’s common stock at a rate of
10
votes per share of common stock into
which the Series B is convertible.

In addition, for as long
as at least
25 % of the shares of Series B remain outstanding, Ault (and any transferees) must consent rights with respect to certain corporate
events, including reclassifications, fundamental transactions, stock redemptions or repurchases, increases in the number of directors,
and declarations or payment of dividends, and further the Company is subject to certain negative covenants, including covenants against
issuing additional shares of capital stock or derivative securities, incurring indebtedness, engaging in related party transactions, selling
of properties having a value of over $ 50,000 , altering the number of directors, and discontinuing the business of any subsidiary, subject
to certain exceptions and limitations.
The terms, rights, preferences
and limitations of the Series C are substantially the same as those of the Series B, except that the Series B holds certain additional
negative covenant and consent rights, and Series C holders vote with the Company’s common stock on an as-converted basis. The Company
is required to maintain a reserve of authorized and unissued shares of common stock equal to
200 % of the shares of common stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, which is initially
800,000,000
shares.
Pending stockholder approval
of the transaction, the Series B and the Series C combined are subject to a
19.9 % beneficial ownership limitation. That limitation includes
shares of Series A issued to Ault on June 8, 2022 and any common stock held by Ault. Certain other rights are subject to stockholder approval
as described below. The SEA provides that the Company will seek stockholder approval following the closing. The entire transaction is
subject to compliance with Nasdaq Rules and the Series B and Series C Certificates each contain a savings clause that nothing shall violate
such Rules. Nasdaq may nonetheless disregard the savings clause.
Under the SEA, effective
at the closing Ault is entitled to appoint three of the Company’s directors, and following receipt of approval from the Company’s
stockholders, a majority of the Company’s directors. The SEA also provides the holders of Preferred Stock with most favored nations
rights in the event the Company offers securities with more favorable terms than the Preferred Stock for as long as the Preferred Stock
remains outstanding. Under the SEA, while any Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Company is prohibited from redeeming or declaring or
paying dividends on outstanding securities other than the Preferred Stock. Further, the SEA prohibits the Company from issuing or amending
securities at a price per share below the conversion price of the Preferred Stock, or to engage in variable rate transactions, for a period
of 12 months following the closing.
The SEA further provides
that following the closing the Company will prepare and distribute a proxy statement and hold a meeting of its stockholders to approve
each of the following: (i) the SEA and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) a ratification of the Third Certificate Designations
of Rights, Preferences, and Limitations of the Series A, (iii) a reverse stock split with a range of between 1-for 2 and 1-for-20, (iv)
a change in the Company’s name to BitNile.com, Inc., (v) an increase of the Company’s authorized common stock to
1,000,000,000
shares of common stock; and (vi) any other proposals to which the Parties shall mutually agree. In addition, pursuant to the SEA the Company
agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to effect its previously announce spin-offs of the common stock of Wolf Energy and White River
held by or issuable to the Company, use its best efforts to complete one or more financings resulting in total gross proceeds of $ 100,000,000
on terms acceptable to Ault, and (financially support the ongoing Zest Labs litigation. The holders of the Preferred Stock will not participate
in the aforementioned spin-offs and distribution. In connection with the SEA, the Company and Ault also agreed that the net litigation
proceeds from the Zest Labs litigation that was ongoing as of November 15, 2022 would be held in a trust for the benefit of the Company’s
stockholders of record as of such date.
In connection with the
SEA, the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Ault and the Minority Shareholders pursuant to which the Company
agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) registering
the resale by the holders of the Preferred Stock and/or the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, to
be initially filed within 15 days of the closing, and to use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective
by the SEC within 45 days thereafter, subject to certain exceptions and limitations.
The SEA contains certain
representations and warranties made by each of the Company, Ault and the Minority Shareholders. Upon the closing, which is subject to
the closing conditions set forth in the SEA, including among other conditions the parties obtaining a fairness opinion from a national
independent valuation firm and satisfactory completion of due diligence by each of the Company and Ault, BitNile.com will continue as
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. BitNile.com’s principal business entails the development and operation of a metaverse
platform, the beta for which is scheduled to launch in March 2023. However, no assurances can be given that the transaction will close,
or that if the transaction closes the Company will realize the anticipated or expected benefits of the transaction.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this Report
as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended March 31, 2022.
Overview
Ecoark Holdings Inc. (“Ecoark Holdings,” “Ecoark”
or the “Company”) is a holding company, incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 19, 2007. Through September 30, 2022,
Ecoark Holdings’ former subsidiaries with the exception of Agora Digital Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Agora”)
and Zest Labs, Inc. (“Zest Labs”) has been treated as divested for accounting purposes. See Notes 1 and 2 to the financial
statements included in this Report. As a result of the divestitures, all assets and liabilities of the former subsidiaries have been reclassified
to discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated balance sheet for March 31, 2022 and all operations of these companies have been
reclassified to discontinued operations and gain on disposal on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine and three
months ended December 31, 2022.
Prior to the recent divestitures, the Company’s
principal subsidiaries consisted of Ecoark, Inc., a Delaware corporation which was the parent of Zest Labs, Banner Midstream Corp., a
Delaware corporation (“Banner Midstream”) and Agora which was assigned the membership interest in Trend Discovery Holdings
LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation (all references to “Trend Holdings” or “Trend” are now synonymous
with Agora) from the Company on September 17, 2021 upon its formation, which includes Bitstream Mining, LLC, the Company’s Bitcoin
mining subsidiary.
Recent Developments
During the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, the Company engaged
in the following transactions:
● Agora entered into a Master Services Agreement (“MSA”)
on December 7, 2022 with an Ault subsidiary whereby the Ault subsidiary agreed to provide mining equipment which Agora would host at its
West Texas location and supply the electricity for the cryptocurrency mining. The MSA requires Agora to initially provide up to 12MW of
electricity at the West Texas site for the Ault subsidiary’s use. An additional 66MW of power can be made available to the Ault
subsidiary as well for a total of 78MW. To meet this obligation, the Company is required to raise at least $5,000,000 to enable the build
out of the hosting facility, including the initial 12MW of power within 45 days of the date of the MSA which deadline was not met.
●
On July 25, 2022 the Company sold White River Holdings Corp (“White
River”) and with it its oil and gas production business to White River Energy Corp, formerly Fortium Holdings Corp. (“WTRV”)
in exchange for 1,200 shares of WTRV’s non-voting Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “WTRV Series A”). Subject
to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designation of the WTRV Series A, the WTRV Series A will become convertible
into 42,253,521 shares of WTRV’s common stock upon such time as (A) WTRV has filed a Form S-1, with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) and such Form S-1 has been declared effective, and (B) Ecoark elects to distribute shares of its common
stock to its stockholders. The Form S-, as amended, is pending SEC Staff review.
●
On August 23, 2022 the Company sold Banner Midstream, which consisted of its transportation business to Wolf Energy Services, Inc. (formerly Enviro Technologies US, Inc.) (“Wolf
Energy ”) in exchange for 51,987,832 shares of the Wolf
Energy
common stock.
●
In September 2022, the Company announced a record date of September 30, 2022 for the spin-offs of common stock of Wolf
Energy
and WTRV to holders of the Company’s common stock and preferred stock (on an as-converted basis).
●
On January 24, 2023, the Company entered into an At-The-Market (“ATM”) Issuance Sales Agreement with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC (“Ascendiant”) as sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell from time to time, through Ascendiant, shares of the Company’s common stock, with offering proceeds of up to $3,500,000. In connection with the ATM offering, the Series A holder agreed to reduce its secondary offering of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A it holds by $3,500,000.
●
On February 8, 2023, the Company entered
into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “SEA”) by and among Ault Alliance, Inc. (“Ault”), the owner of approximately
86% of BitNile.com, Inc. (“BitNile.com”), and the minority stockholders of BitNile.com which contemplates the Company acquiring
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of BitNile.com in exchange for shares if newly designated preferred stock to have a combined
stated value of $100,000,000, and subject to adjustment will be convertible into a total of up to 400,000,000 shares of the Company’s
Common Stock, which represent approximately 92.4% of the Company outstanding Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. BitNile.com’s
principal business envisions operating a metaverse platform which is under development, and the beta for which is scheduled to launch
in March 2023. However, no assurances can be provided that this transaction will close, including due to closing conditions such as the
requirement that the Company obtain a fairness opinion from an independent national third party appraisal firm, as well as satisfactory
due diligence by the parties.
In addition to the potential acquisition of BitNile.com as contemplated
by the SEA, the Company’s goal is to spin-off all of the Wolf
Energy
common stock and
WTRV common stock to the Company’s stockholders in calendar year 2023, although because of regulatory delays or other reasons we
may not meet that deadline. At the same time, we expect to acquire either BitNile.com under the SEA described above or another business
so we do not become a shell corporation. This will result in a change of control and may or may not be subject to stockholder approval.
40
Future Spin-Offs
As described in this
Report, Ecoark’s goal is to spin-off its common stock of White River and Wolf Energy. While the Company previously planned on spinning
off Zest Labs common stock in a similar fashion, the Company decided not to proceed with that spin-off. Due to market conditions, the
Company decided it was inadvisable to seek to raise capital for Zest Labs which it needed to operate as a stand-alone public company.
To protect the Company’s stockholders, it granted its stockholders of record as of September 30, 2022 the right to receive 95% of
the net proceeds of the Zest Labs litigation with Walmart and Deloitte, which is describe under Note 15 to the financial statements contained
in this Report. That right is part of the Zest Labs certificate of incorporation. Under the SEA, the BitNile.com stockholders agreed that
they will not participate in any of these distributions if the transaction closes.
Following the above transactions,
the Company’s only remaining subsidiaries are Agora, which ceased mining Bitcoin but is now exploring operating as a hosting company
for Bitcoin mining ventures, and Zest Labs which holds technology and related intellectual property rights for fresh food solutions, and
is not operating due to ongoing litigation involving its technology an intellectual property.
Segment Reporting
for the Nine and Three Months Ended December 31, 2022:
As a result of the sales
of White River and Banner Midstream, and the immaterial nature of the operations of Zest Labs, the Company no longer segregates its operations
as most of the continuing operations are related to Agora.
Key Trends
Impact of Inflation
In 2022, there has been
a sharp rise in inflation in the U.S. and globally. Given our limited operations, the most significant future impact will be on employee
salaries and benefits and electricity costs.
Impact of COVID-19
COVID-19 may continue
to affect the economy and our business, depending on the vaccine rollouts and the emergence of virus mutations as well as the impact of
supply chain disruptions.
COVID-19 did not have
a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the fiscal quarter ended December
31, 2022 included in this Report.
COVID-19 has been a contributing
factor in supply and labor shortages which have been pervasive in many industries. The extent to which a future COVID-19 outbreak and
other adverse developments may impact the Company’s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted.
Results of Operations
For Continuing Operations For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenues
The discussion of our
results of operations should be evaluated considering that our primary subsidiaries were sold in the three months ended December 31, 2022
and their results of operations are now treated as discontinued operations.
The Company had no revenue in the three months
ended December 31, 2022 (“Q3 2023”) and had $17,455 in 2021 (“Q3 2022”) as it had just recently commenced Bitcoin
mining operations. Agora has recently focused on becoming a hosting company as reflected below. To that end, Agora entered into the MSA
with Ault described above, whereby Agora agreed to host Ault’s cryptocurrency mining equipment at Agora’s West Texas location
and supply the electricity for the cryptocurrency mining.
The Company’s Bitcoin operations began in the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2022 and ceased on March 3, 2022 due to the low price of Bitcoin and the inability of Agora to timely complete its initial public
offering which created a working capital issue. The Company intends to refocus Agora to operating as a hosting company providing infrastructure
and energy to cryptocurrency mining enterprises assuming the Company can raise the necessary capital. Unless and until we are successful
in generating revenue for Agora or acquire another operating
41
Cost of Revenues and
Gross Profit
Cost of revenues for
Q3 2023 was $47,460 as compared to $92,823 for Q3 2022. We expect cost of revenues to increase once we have commenced Agora’s hosting
operations.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses
were $3,005,922 for Q3 2023 compared to $4,692,895 for Q3 2022. The decrease between periods were primarily related to a decrease in salaries
and salaries related costs to $1,280,078 in Q3 2023 from $3,159,979 in Q3 2022 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation in Q3
2022 compared to Q3 2023.
Other Income (Expense)
Total other income was $5,948,563 in Q3 2023, compared to total other
income of $10,982,731 in Q3 2022, almost all of which was non-cash. Change in fair value of derivative liabilities for Q3 2023 was a non-cash
gain of $1,381,711 related to the changes in our stock price, a change in the fair value of the preferred stock derivative liability for
Q3 2023 of $1,864,777, a gain of $2,878,345 related to the preferred stock derivative liability at inception, and interest expense, net
of ($172,347). Change in fair value of derivative liabilities for Q3 2022 was a non-cash gain of $10,979,137 related to the changes in
our stock price.
Net Income from Continuing
Operations
Net income from continuing
operations for Q3 2023 was $2,895,181 as compared to net income from continuing operations of $6,214,468 for Q3 2022. The decrease was
primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses as noted above offset by the change in the fair value of the derivative liability
and the change in the preferred stock derivative liability
arising from the decrease
in the Company’s Common Stock price.
Results of Operations
For Continuing Operations For the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenues
The Company had no revenue in the nine months ended December 31, 2022
(“9M 2023”) and $17,455 in the nine months ended December 31, 2021 related to the Bitcoin mining operation (“9M 2022”).
To that end, on December 7, 2022, Agora entered into the MSA with Ault described above.

9M 2023 was $229,534 as compared to $92,823 for 9M 2022. We expect cost of revenues to increase once we have commenced Agora’s
hosting operations.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses
were $17,909,843 for 9M 2023 compared to $10,775,053 for 9M 2022. The increase between periods were primarily related to an increase in
salaries and salaries related costs to $10,998,108 in 9M 2023 from $5,504,833 in 9M 2022 arising from the stock-based compensation of
$9,370,769 in 9M 2023 versus $3,786,342 in 9M 2022, and to a lesser extent an $1,655,969 increase related to the impairment of the miners
that Agora had purchased as it has moved to a hosting model from a mining model for Bitcoin.
Other Income (Expense)
Total other income was $7,951,535 in 9M 2023, compared to total other
income of $14,741,253 in 9M 2022. Change in fair value of derivative liabilities for 9M 2023 was a non-cash gain of $4,274,183, and the
change in the fair value of the preferred stock derivative liability of $1,864,777, a gain of $2,878,345 related to the preferred stock
derivative liability at inception, partially offset by a loss on disposal of fixed assets of $(570,772) related to Agora’s settlement
wherein mining equipment valued at $1,425,772 were exchanged with a vendor for a credit of $855,000; and interest expense, net of interest
income of $(491,075). Change in fair value of derivative liabilities for 9M 2022 was a non-cash gain of $15,294,814, partially offset
by interest expense, net of interest income of $(553,561).
42
Net Income (Loss)
from Continuing Operations
Net loss from continuing
operations for 9M 2023 was ($10,187,842) as compared to net income from continuing operations of $3,890,832 for 9M 2022. The decrease
was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and salaries related costs and our 9M 2023 impairment charge, partially offset by
the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities and the change of the preferred stock liability.
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support
its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management
of liquidity are revenue generated from operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.
Net cash used in
operating activities for continuing operations was $(12,385,949) for 9M 2023, as compared to $(8,414,833) for 9M 2022. Cash used in
operating activities for 9M 2023 was primarily caused by the net loss offset by increases in common shares issued for services,
and losses on disposal of former subsidiaries without similar amounts in 9M 2022 as well as changes in accounts
payable and accrued expenses from 9M 2022 to 9M 2023.
Net cash provided by
investing activities was $517,221 for 9M 2023 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $(9,392,671) for 9M 2022. Net cash
provided by investing activities in 9M 2023 were comprised of proceeds received from the refund of the power development costs partially
offset by purchases of fixed assets and discontinued operations, and the amounts used in 9M 2022 related to the purchase of fixed assets
and power development costs as we commenced operations in Agora.
Net cash provided by financing activities for
9M 2023 was $11,816,297 which comprised primarily of proceeds from our June 2022 sale of the Ecoark Series A, Commitment Shares described
elsewhere in this Report. This compared with 9M 2022 net cash provided by financing activities of $17,431,074 comprised primarily of the
sale of our common stock in a registered direct offering.
As of February 14, 2023, the Company has $31,294 in cash and cash equivalents.
The Company believes that the current cash on hand is not sufficient to conduct planned operations for one year from the issuance of the
consolidated financial statements and needs to raise capital to support their operations.
To date we have financed
our operations through sales of common stock, convertible preferred stock and other derivative securities and the issuance of debt. We
may also issue common stock, preferred stock or other securities in connection with any business acquisition we undertake in the future
following our planned spin-offs. Presently we may not raise capital without the consent of the Purchaser.
On January 24, 2023,
the Company entered an ATM Agreement with Ascendiant as sales agent, which contemplates sales of shares of our common stock in a registered
“at-the-market” offering for offering proceeds of up to $3,500,000. As of the date of this Report, the Company has sold 1,425,928
shares for total gross proceeds of $475,623, at an average price of $0.333 per share.
The
Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.
GAAP”) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The Company sold its interests in Banner Midstream in two separate transactions on July 25, 2022 and
September 7, 2022. In addition, it sold the non-core business of Trend Discovery on June 17, 2022. The Company expects to distribute
the common stock it received (or issuable upon conversion of preferred stock) in the sales to its stockholders upon the effective
registration statements for the two entities the companies were sold to. See Note 13, “Series A Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock” for information on the Company’s recent $12 million convertible preferred stock financing. That
financing has restrictive covenants that require approval of the investor for the Company to engage in any equity or debt financing.
The Company believes that the current cash on hand is not sufficient to conduct planned operations for 12 months from the issuance
of the consolidated financial statements and may need to raise capital to support their operations. While the Company entered into
the MSA with Ault which if the hosting arrangement is established would provide a source of revenue, as of the date of this Report
the Company has not yet met its obligations under the MSA, including raising at least $5,000,000 to establish the initial
infrastructure and power for the hosting arrangement . Further, if we acquire BitNile.com as contemplated by the SEA, we
expect to require substantial additional capital to further develop its metaverse platform and launch revenue-generating operations
therefrom, and no assurance can be given that we will be able to close that acquisition or that if we are we will be able to
leverage the BitNile.com business as needed to generate material revenue or raise the necessary capital. See “Risk
Factors” included in this Report.
The accompanying financial statements
for the period ended December 31, 2022 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, but the ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes
continued revenue streams and becomes profitable. Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital
through sales of equity securities and borrowing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful
in accomplishing any of its plans. If the Company is not able to obtain the necessary additional financing on a timely basis, the Company
will be required to delay, reduce or perhaps even cease the operation of its business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern.
43
Agora Line of Credit
As of February 14, 2023,
the Company has advanced a total of $5,692,463 to Agora under a $7.5 million term line of credit note issued to the Company by Agora which
bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum. Agora will be required to repay any sums we lend it on March 31, 2023 with accrued interest.
2018 Line of Credit
On December 28, 2018,
the Company entered into a $10,000,000 credit facility that includes a loan and security agreement (the “Agreement”) where
the lender agreed to make one or more loans to the Company, and the Company may make a request for a loan or loans from the lender, subject
to the terms and conditions. In the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed $505,181, which includes $17,681 in commitment
fees, with the balance of $487,500 being deposited directly into the Company, and repaid $810,000 in the nine months ended December 31,
2022. Interest incurred for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $50,888, and accrued as of December 31, 2022 was $53,111. There
were no advances in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. With the sale of Trend Holdings, we no longer can access this line of credit.

publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Critical Accounting
Policies, Estimates and Assumptions
The critical accounting
policies listed below are those the Company deems most important to its operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include,
but are not limited to, management’s estimate of provisions required for uncollectible accounts receivable, fair value of assets
held for sale and assets and liabilities acquired, impaired value of equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, asset retirement
obligations, estimates of discount rates in lease, liabilities to accrue, fair value of derivative liabilities associated with warrants,
cost incurred in the satisfaction of performance obligations, permanent and temporary differences related to income taxes and determination
of the fair value of stock awards.
Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
44
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes
revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core
principle:
●
Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer
●
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
●
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation
In order to identify
the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify
each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct”
good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or
service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable
of being distinct), and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other
promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).
If a good or service
is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified
that is distinct.
The transaction price
is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a
customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining
the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:
●
Variable consideration
●
Constraining estimates of variable consideration
●
The existence of a significant financing component in the contract
●
Noncash consideration
●
Consideration payable to a customer
Variable consideration
is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue
recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
45
The transaction price
is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price is the price at
which the Company would sell a promised service separately to a customer. The relative selling price for each performance obligation is
estimated using observable objective evidence if it is available. If observable objective evidence is not available, the Company uses
its best estimate of the selling price for the promised service. In instances where the Company does not sell a service separately, establishing
standalone selling price requires significant judgment. The Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering available information,
prioritizing observable inputs such as historical sales, internally approved pricing guidelines and objectives, and the underlying cost
of delivering the performance obligation. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance
obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.
Management judgment is required when determining
the following: when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal (and hence can be included in revenue); whether
certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs; when a promised service transfers to the customer; and the
applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time. Although, Agora since March 3, 2022, has not
recognized revenue from its mining operations, prior to this time, it recognized revenue upon satisfaction of its performance obligation
over time in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-27 for its contracts with mining pool operators.
The Company accounts
for incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and contract fulfillment costs in accordance with ASC 340-40,  Other
Assets and Deferred Costs . These costs should be capitalized and amortized as the performance obligation is satisfied if certain criteria
are met. The Company elected the practical expedient, to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred
if the amortization period of the asset that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less, and expenses certain costs to obtain
contracts when applicable. The Company recognizes an asset from the costs to fulfill a contract only if the costs relate directly to a
contract, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying a performance obligation in the future and the costs
are expected to be recovered. The Company recognizes the cost of sales of a contract as expense when incurred or when a performance obligation
is satisfied. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized unless the costs would have been incurred regardless of whether
the contract was obtained, are not considered recoverable, or the practical expedient applies.
Hosting Revenues
Agora effective in September 2022 began efforts to generate revenue
via hosting agreements. Agora entered into a MSA on December 7, 2022 with Ault, whereby Ault agreed to provide mining equipment which
Agora would host at its West Texas location and supply the electricity for the cryptocurrency mining.
When Agora generates hosting revenues, it will
follow ASC 606 as outlined above and recognize revenue upon the completion of the performance obligations as stipulated under the MSA.
Fair Value Measurements
ASC 820  Fair
Value Measurements  defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands
disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy:
Level 1 inputs: Quoted
prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 inputs: Quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 inputs: Instruments
with primarily unobservable value drivers.
The carrying values of
the Company’s financial instruments such as cash, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their respective fair values
because of the short-term nature of those financial instruments.
46
Derivative Financial
Instruments
The Company does not
currently use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks, but may explore hedging oil prices
in the current fiscal year. Management evaluates all of the Company’s financial instruments, including warrants, to determine if
such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company generally uses a Black-Scholes
model, as applicable, to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates when needed. The classification
of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is remeasured at the end
of each reporting period. The Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities.
Recently Issued
Accounting Standards
In August 2020, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion
and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for
Convertible Instruments and Contract’s in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments
by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a
single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions
that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify
for it. The ASU simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas.
The ASU is effective
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2021, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2021-04 “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and
Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation— Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in
Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815- 40) Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified
Written Call Options” which clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding
equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An entity
should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity
classified after modification or exchange as follows: i) for a modification or an exchange that is a part of or directly related to a
modification or an exchange of an existing debt instrument or line-of-credit or revolving-debt arrangements (hereinafter, referred to
as a “debt” or “debt instrument”), as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged written
call option and the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged; ii) for all other modifications
or exchanges, as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option over the fair value of that written
call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments prospectively
to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company does not believe this new guidance
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
The Company does not
discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows or disclosures.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Our management, with
the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers
have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Disclosure controls and
procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no material
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on
Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and
procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II — OTHER
INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Other than discussed
below, during the period covered by this report, there were no material developments in the legal proceedings disclosed in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Investing in our common
stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should review the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended March 31, 2022. In addition, investors should consider the risk factors described below.
Although we reported
net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, such results are unrelated to our actual performance.
During the third quarter
ended December 31, 2022, we reported net operating income from continuing operations of $2,895,181. Investors should consider that the
income arose from GAAP which provides that our derivative liabilities operate inversely to our stock price. If our stock price in a given
quarter goes down, we recognize non-cash income. Conversely if our stock price goes up, we report a non-cash loss.
There is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern, and if we are unable to close the acquisition of BitNile.com or raise sufficient capital to launch cryptocurrency
mining hosting operations through Agora, we may be forced to cease operations.
As disclosed under “Liquidity and Capital
Resources,” we do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations for the next 12 months, and there is substantial doubt as to
our ability to continue as a going concern. As disclosed elsewhere, on February 8, 2023 we entered into the SEA contemplating our acquisition
of BitNile.com, the result of which would be BitNile.com becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary and us operating a development stage metaverse
platform through BitNile.com. However, the acquisition may not close due to reasons beyond our control, including a closing condition
that we acquire a fairness opinion, and that each party complete satisfactory due diligence. Further, if we are delisted from Nasdaq,
which may result from inquiries which are currently pending as more particularly described in this Report, the stockholders of BitNile.com,
particularly Ault, may determine not to proceed with the transaction, as one of the principal benefits envisioned by the SEA for BitNile.com
is for the BitNile.com business to operate autonomously under the corporate umbrella of a Nasdaq-issuer, and be able to have access to
capital thereby.
If we acquire BitNile.com, we anticipate requiring
substantial additional capital to fund its operations, particularly given its metaverse platform is still under development, with its
beta test scheduled to launch in March 2023. Further, if the acquisition of BitNile.com contemplated by the SEA does not close and in
any event, we will need to raise at least $5,000,000 in order to fully launch our planned cryptocurrency mining hosting business through
Agora under the MSA with an affiliate Ault and may require additional capital beyond the initial $5,000,000 to expand that business. In
order to raise the capital required, we may need to issue common stock or common stock equivalents which will dilute our current stockholders,
and/or debt securities which could subject us to negative covenants that hinder our ability to manage our business and take certain corporate
actions as intended or at all. If we fail to proceed with the above-described transactions and/or raise sufficient capital to fund our
planned operations as and when needed, we could be forced to cease operations, in which case you could lose some or all of your investment
in us.
Nasdaq has recently provided us with correspondence
containing violation notices and questions arising from certain of our prior transactions, the result of which could be our common stock
being delisted from Nasdaq.
As disclosed elsewhere in this Report under “Note
15: Commitments And Contingencies – Nasdaq Compliance,” in December 2022 the Company was notified by Nasdaq of alleged violations
of the Nasdaq Listing Rules in connection with an amendment to the Series A that was effected in November 2022. Specifically, the notice
alleges that by reducing the conversion price of the Series A and entitling the holder to vote with the common stock on an as-converted
basis, the Company violated Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) by issuing over 20% of the outstanding common stock without first obtaining stockholder
approval, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5640 by providing the holder of the Series A with disproportionate voting rights relative to the holders
of common stock. While the Company submitted its initial response to Nasdaq including a plan of remediation, we cannot predict how Nasdaq
will respond, including whether it will deem our responses and plan of remediation to be acceptable to remain compliant with the Nasdaq
Listing Rules and maintain compliance therewith and listing on Nasdaq. Additionally, Nasdaq also sent two separate rounds of correspondence
in December 2022 and January 2023 containing inquiries regarding the Company’s July 25, 2022 divestment of White River Holdings
to White River Energy Corp, including questions focused on whether the transaction was appropriately valued and whether any conflicts
of interest or other issues are present given that Jay Puchir and Randy May are on the management teams of both the Company and White
River Energy Corp. Finally, in December 2022 the Company also received a notice of deficiency with Nasdaq Rules because the closing price
of our common stock was below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, and unless our stock price goes above the $1.00 minimum bid price
requirement for 10 consecutive trading days on its own, we will need to effect a reverse stock split or take other action to remediate
this deficiency. In addition to all of these matters, Nasdaq may take the position that the acquisition of BitNile.com not only requires
stockholder approval to issue more than 19.9% of our common stock to Ault and the minority stockholders of BitNile.com but also that the
super voting rights violate Nasdaq Rules. We cannot assure you that Nasdaq will permit us to have our common stock to remain listed.
49
Any of the foregoing matters could result in our
common stock being delisted from Nasdaq. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, we could face significant material adverse consequences,
including:
● Ault
may decide not to proceed with the BitNile.com transaction under the SEA, in which case we
will not realize the anticipated benefits of that transaction;
● We
could face greater difficulty raising capital as and when need, on favorable terms, or at
all, and could be forced to enter into more dilutive or onerous financing transactions given
the relative lack of liquidity following a delisting;
● We
could also face challenges in locating and obtaining a viable replacement acquisition target
if the BitNile.com transaction does not close;
● There
could be a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity
with respect to our common stock;
● Our
shares of common stock could become a “penny stock” which will require broker-dealers
trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced
level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; and
● There
will be a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company.
If
we are unable to rectify any of the above-described Nasdaq issues, including potentially for failure to timely obtain stockholder approval,
delisting will subject us and our stockholders to the above and other adverse consequences, and could also delay or prevent us from acquiring
BitNile.com or effecting the announced spin-offs of common stock of certain entities as described elsewhere in this Report.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
