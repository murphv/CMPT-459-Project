AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 (Dollars in thousands, except per share and stated value amounts) (Unaudited) 1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Axos Financial, Inc. (“Axos”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Axos Bank (the “Bank”) and Axos Nevada Holding, LLC (“Axos Nevada Holding” and collectively, the “Company”). Axos Bank and its wholly owned subsidiary constitute the Banking Business segment and Axos Nevada Holding wholly owns the companies constituting the Securities Business segment. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements, presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), are unaudited and reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods. All adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the year as a whole. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or not repeated herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
with respect to interim financial reporting. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (“2022 Form 10-K”).
A reclassification of certain components of non-interest income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 has been made to conform to the current period presentation. This reclassification had no effect on the Company’s total non-interest income, net income, financial position or cash flows. Additional reclassifications of certain amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended December 31, 2021 have been made to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial position. Significant Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in
Note 1 — “Organizations and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies”
contained in the 2022 Form 10-K.
New Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued three Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) (2020-04, 2021-04 and 2022-06) all of which provide guidance to alleviate the burden in accounting for reference rate reform by allowing certain expedients and exceptions in applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions impacted by reference rate reform. The provisions apply only to those transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. Adoption of the provisions are optional and are effective from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Company is evaluating the impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, but it does not expect any application of the provisions of these ASUs to have a material impact. For a further discussion of new accounting standards issued but not yet adopted which are applicable to the Company see
Note 1 — “Organizations and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies”
contained in the 2022 Form 10-K. 7 Table of Contents 2.      ACQUISITIONS From time to time the Company completes acquisitions and related corporate activities to supplement the organic growth and development of the business. On August 2, 2021, the Company’s subsidiary, Axos Clearing LLC, acquired certain assets and liabilities of E*TRADE Advisor Services (“EAS”), the registered investment advisor custody business of Morgan Stanley. This business was rebranded as Axos Advisor Services (“AAS”). AAS adds incremental fee income, a turnkey technology platform used by independent registered investment advisors for trading and custody services, and low cost deposits that can be used to generate fee income from other bank partners or to fund loan growth at Axos Bank. The purchase price of $ 54.8  million consisted entirely of cash consideration paid upon acquisition and working capital adjustments. The Company incurred acquisition-related costs totaling $ 0.04
million in total, all of which were recognized in the year ended June 30, 2022. The acquisition is accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, tangible and intangible assets acquired (and liabilities assumed) are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the $ 54.6  million purchase price consisted of $ 14.4  million of fair value of tangible assets acquired (which included $ 7.8  million of a right-of-use lease asset), $ 11.3  million of liabilities assumed (which included $ 7.8  million of a lease liability), $ 27.1  million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 24.4  million of goodwill, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. In December 2021, the Company made a $ 0.2  million true-up payment based on working capital adjustments, which was recorded as an increase in the purchase price up to $ 54.8  million with no impact on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets. After the working capital true-up, the final acquisition fair value of tangible assets acquired was $ 14.2  million and the final acquisition fair value of liabilities acquired was $ 10.9  million. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of consideration exchanged over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. The goodwill includes synergies expected to result from combining the acquired assets and liabilities with existing operations, coupling its custody platform with the Company’s existing product offerings and leveraging customer relationships through registered investment advisors (“RIAs”).

0.8 % (- 1.2 %) The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s residential mortgage-backed securities are projected prepayment rates, probability of default, projected loss severity in the event of default and discount rate over LIBOR.
Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the projected loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for projected prepayment rates.

19 Table of Contents Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans based on credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings. Pass.
Loans classified as pass are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the fair value of any underlying collateral, less cost to acquire and sell in a timely manner. Special Mention . Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date. Substandard . Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful . Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The Company reviews and grades loans following a continuous review process, featuring coverage of all loan types and business lines at least quarterly.
Continuous reviewing provides more effective risk monitoring because it immediately tests for potential impacts caused by changes in personnel, policy, products or underwriting standards. 20 Table of Contents The amortized cost basis of the Company’s loans by fiscal year of origination and credit quality indicator are: December 31, 2022 Loans Held for Investment Origination Year Revolving Loans

The Plan is designed to encourage selected employees and directors to improve operations and increase profits, and to accept or continue employment or association with the Company through participation in the growth in the value of the Company’s common stock. The Company also has an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer that authorizes an award of restricted stock units (the “RSU award”).

The Company leases office space under operating lease agreements scheduled to expire at various dates.
The following table represents maturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 in the corresponding fiscal years: (Dollars in thousands) Remainder of fiscal year 2023 $ 5,450   2024 10,976   2025 11,143   2026 10,811   2027 10,870   Thereafter 29,177   Total lease payments 78,427   Less: amount representing interest ( 7,569 ) Total Lease Liability $ 70,858   Credit-Related Financial Instruments . The Company is a party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments are commitments to extend credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. At December 31, 2022, the Company had commitments to originate $ 93.3
million in fixed rate loans and $ 2,956.4  million in variable rate loans, totaling an aggregate principal balance of $ 3,049.6
million. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s fixed rate commitments to originate had a weighted-average rate of
9.45 %. At December 31, 2022, the Company also had commitments to sell $ 4.6  million in fixed rate loans and
no
variable rate loans, totaling an aggregate principal balance of $ 4.6
million. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. 25 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, Axos Clearing’s customer activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various customer securities transactions. These activities may expose Axos Clearing to off-balance-sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contracted obligations and Axos Clearing has to purchase or sell the financial instrument underlying the contract at a loss. Axos Clearing’s clearing agreements with broker-dealers for which it provides clearing services requires them to indemnify Axos Clearing if customers fail to satisfy their contractual obligation. Litigation .
On October 15, 2015, the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer were named defendants in a putative class action lawsuit,
Golden v. BofI Holding, Inc., et al , and brought in United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the “Golden Case”). On November 3, 2015, the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer were named defendants in a second putative class action lawsuit,
Hazan v. BofI Holding, Inc., et al , and also brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the “Hazan Case”). On February 1, 2016, the Golden Case and the Hazan Case were consolidated as In re BofI Holding, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case #: 3:15-cv-02324-GPC-KSC (the “HMEPS Class Action”), and the Houston Municipal Employees Pension System was appointed lead plaintiff. The plaintiffs allege that the Company and other named defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by failing to disclose wrongful conduct that was alleged in a complaint filed in connection with a wrongful termination of employment lawsuit filed on October 13, 2015 (the “Employment Matter”) and that as a result the Company’s statements regarding its internal controls, as well as portions of its financial statements, were false and misleading. On April 13, 2022, the parties executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement. The Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement was submitted to the District Court for approval on April 15, 2022. On June 8, 2022, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and scheduled a hearing with respect to final approval of the settlement for October 7, 2022. On October 14, 2022, the District Court entered an order granting final approval of such settlement. The settlement was reached because the parties were able to negotiate terms within available insurance coverage and reach a stipulation that specifically provides that (i) all amounts due in connection with the settlement be paid exclusively by the insurers and that defendants have no direct liability in connection therewith, (ii) no wrongdoing be attributed to Axos, its management or its directors, (iii) the settlement is not to be construed as conceding or evidencing the truth or validity of any claim or allegation made by plaintiffs, and (iv) the defendants shall be deemed to have agreed, or otherwise be required, to modify, amend or restate any business practices, policies, procedures, regulatory filings or financial records, as a result thereof. In addition to the HMEPS Class Action,
two
separate shareholder derivative actions were filed in December, 2015, purportedly on behalf of the Company. The first derivative action,
Calcaterra v. Garrabrants, et al , was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on December 3, 2015. The second derivative action,
Dow v. Micheletti, et al , was filed in the San Diego County Superior Court on December 16, 2015. A third derivative action,
DeYoung v. Garrabrants, et al , was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on January 22, 2016, a fourth derivative action,
Yong v. Garrabrants, et al , was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on January 29, 2016, a fifth derivative action,
Laborers Pension Trust Fund of Northern Nevada v. Allrich et al , was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on February 2, 2016, and a sixth derivative action,
Garner v. Garrabrants, et al , was filed in the San Diego County Superior Court on August 10, 2017. Each of these
six
derivative actions names the Company as a nominal defendant, and certain of its officers and directors as defendants. Each complaint sets forth allegations of breaches of fiduciary duties, gross mismanagement, abuse of control, and unjust enrichment against the defendant officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these derivative actions seek damages in unspecified amounts on the Company’s behalf from the officer and director defendants, certain corporate governance actions, and an award of their costs and attorney’s fees. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California ordered the
six
above-referenced derivative actions pending before it to be consolidated and appointed lead counsel in the consolidated action. The matter has been stayed until pending post-trial motions in the Employment Matter are resolved.The
two
derivative actions pending before the San Diego County Superior Court have been consolidated and have been stayed by agreement of the parties. On October 26, 2022, a jury verdict was reached in the case of
MUFG Union Bank, N.A. v. Axos Bank, et al , awarding damages to Union Bank. Such verdict has yet to be reduced to judgment. On November 28, 2022, the Company filed a post-trial motion requesting, among other relief, that the court set aside the verdict and direct a verdict for defendants. The Company continues to believe that the evidence supports the defendants’ understanding of the facts and that meritorious defenses exist to substantially all claims made by Union Bank. In addition, the Company believes that there exist substantial grounds for post-verdict relief and appeal. The Company recorded a $ 16  million accrued expense in accounts payable and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and in general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statements of income as of and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. 26 Table of Contents 9.     SEGMENT REPORTING AND REVENUE INFORMATION Segment Reporting.
The operating segments reported below are the segments of the Company for which separate financial information is available and for which segment results are evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The operating segments and segment results of the Company are determined based upon the management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments and by which segment results are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on pre-tax profit or loss from operations. Certain corporate administration costs and income taxes have not been allocated to the reportable segments. The Company operates through
two
operating segments: Banking Business and Securities Business. Inter-segment transactions are eliminated in consolidation and primarily include non-interest income earned by the Securities Business segment and non-interest expense incurred by the Banking Business segment for cash sorting fees related to deposits sourced from Securities Business segment customers, as well as interest expense paid by the Banking Business segment to each of the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company and to the Company itself for their operating cash held on deposit with the Business Banking segment. In order to reconcile the
two

Critical Accounting Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities, our results of operations and/or our cash flows. Critical accounting estimates are those we consider most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting estimates are described in detail in
Note 1 - “Organizations and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies”
and under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in the 2022 Form 10-K. 30 Table of Contents
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report includes the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per common share, and tangible book value per common share. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not audited.
Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious as to their reliance on such measures. As noted below with respect to each measure, we believe the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, and our management uses these non-GAAP measures when it internally evaluates the performance of our business and makes operating decisions. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for GAAP basis financial measures. We define “adjusted earnings”, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income without the after-tax impact of non-recurring acquisition-related costs (including amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions) and other costs (unusual or non-recurring charges). Adjusted earnings per diluted common share (“adjusted EPS”), a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted earnings by the average number of diluted common shares outstanding during the period. We believe the non-GAAP measures of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS provide useful information about the Company’s operating performance. We believe excluding the non-recurring acquisition-related costs, and other costs provides investors with an alternative understanding of our core business. Below is a reconciliation of net income, the nearest compatible GAAP measure, to adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP) for the periods shown:

Tangible book value is calculated using common stockholders’ equity minus mortgage servicing rights, goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible book value per common share, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by dividing tangible book value by the common shares outstanding at the end of the period. We believe tangible book value per common share is useful in evaluating the Company’s capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses.

December 31, 2022 and 2021 For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of $81.6 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared to net income of $60.8 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of $140.0 million, or $2.31 per diluted share, compared to net income of $121.0 million, or $1.99 per diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Net Interest Income Net interest income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $199.9 million and $380.4 million, an increase of 37.3% and 30.2%, compared to net interest income of $145.6 million and $292.2 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase for the three and six months was primarily due to higher average balances and rates earned in the loan portfolio, partially offset by higher rates paid on deposits.
Total interest and dividend income during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 increased 78.0% to $279.6 million and 59.6% to $503.4 million, compared to $157.1 million and $315.4 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in interest and dividend income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher average balances and rates earned in the loan portfolio and higher rates on deposits placed with other financial institutions. Total interest expense was $79.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $68.2 million or 592.4% as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021. Total interest expense was $123.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $99.8 million or 430.7% as compared with the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher rates paid on deposits, as deposit rates continue to increase across the industry. Also contributing to the increase was higher interest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and other borrowings, which for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher balances of other borrowings and higher rates paid on both FHLB advances and other borrowings, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase was attributable to higher average balances and higher rates on both FHLB advances and other borrowings. Net interest margin, defined as annualized net interest income divided by average earning assets, increased 39 basis points to 4.49% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 4.10% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and increased 22 basis points to 4.38% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 4.16% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the primary contributor to the 39 and 22 basis point increases, respectively, was the increase in interest-earning balances and rates, primarily loans, outpacing the increased cost of our deposits and other funding liabilities.

Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); and (ii) effects on interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The change in interest due to both volume and rate has been allocated proportionally to both, based on their relative absolute values.

The provision for credit losses was $12.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $8.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to
growth in the loan portfolio and changes in loan product mix.
Provisions for credit losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for credit losses - loans to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under “Financial Condition—Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans.”
37 Table of Contents Non-Interest Income The following table sets forth information regarding our non-interest income for the periods shown: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Inc (Dec) 2022 2021 Inc (Dec) Broker-dealer fee income $ 9,812  $ 6,332  $ 3,480  $ 18,990  $ 12,794  $ 6,196  Advisory fee income 6,983  8,035  (1,052) 13,942  13,339  603  Banking and service fees 10,143  8,486  1,657  16,657  15,166  1,491  Mortgage banking income 641  4,640  (3,999) 4,006  9,910  (5,904) Prepayment penalty fee income 750  3,294  (2,544) 1,942  6,280  (4,338) Total non-interest income $ 28,329  $ 30,787  $ (2,458) $ 55,537  $ 57,489  $ (1,952)
Non-interest income decreased $2.5 million to $28.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily the result of lower mortgage banking income as higher mortgage rates contributed to lower originations, and the impact of changes in the fair value of our MSRs. Also contributing to the decrease was lower prepayment penalty fee income due to slower prepayments and a decrease in advisory fee income primarily due to lower average assets under custody. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in broker-dealer fee income from higher rates earned on cash sorting balances placed at non-affiliated banks and higher banking and service fees.
Non-interest income decreased $2.0 million to $55.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily the result of lower mortgage banking income as higher mortgage rates contributed to lower originations, and the impact of changes in the fair value of our MSRs. Also contributing to the decrease was lower prepayment penalty fee income due to slower prepayments. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher broker-dealer fee income from higher rates earned on cash sorting balances placed at non-affiliated banks, higher banking and service fees as well as higher advisory fee income as incremental revenues from the AAS acquisition were partially offset by lower average assets under custody.
Non-Interest Expense     The following table sets forth information regarding our non-interest expense for the periods shown:   For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Inc (Dec) 2022 2021 Inc (Dec) Salaries and related costs $ 49,720  $ 39,979  $ 9,741  $ 96,716  $ 80,716  $ 16,000  Data processing 14,632  12,199  2,433  28,654  24,291  4,363  Depreciation and amortization 5,957  6,785  (828) 12,051  12,513  (462) Advertising and promotional 10,899  3,402  7,497  17,269  6,774  10,495  Professional services 8,455  5,943  2,512  16,542  10,488  6,054  Occupancy and equipment 3,683  3,342  341  7,737  6,523  1,214  FDIC and regulatory fees 3,569  2,475  1,094  7,304  4,741  2,563  Broker-dealer clearing charges 3,739  3,678  61  6,568  7,683  (1,115) General and administrative expense 6,874  8,216  (1,342) 30,774  16,721  14,053  Total non-interest expenses $ 107,528  $ 86,019  $ 21,509  $ 223,615  $ 170,450  $ 53,165  Non-interest expense was $107.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $86.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Non-interest expense was $223.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, up from $170.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increases for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to higher salaries and related costs, advertising and promotional expenses, professional services, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, higher other general and administrative expenses.
Total salaries and related costs increased $9.7 million to $49.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $40.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and increased $16.0 million to $96.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $80.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increases in compensation expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to increased headcount as well as an increase in salaries. Our headcount increased to 1,447 from 1,280, or 13% between December 31, 2022 and 2021. 38 Table of Contents Data processing expense increased $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, and increased $4.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six month period ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to enhancements to customer interfaces and the Company’s processing systems. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The decreases for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to certain capitalized software becoming fully depreciated, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, the decrease was partially offset by incremental amortization of intangibles as a result of the AAS acquisition. Advertising and promotional expense increased $7.5 million and $10.5 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased lead generation and deposit marketing costs. Professional services expense increased $2.5 million and $6.1 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to higher consulting expenses supporting technology investments and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase was also attributable to higher legal expenses related to litigation.
Occupancy and equipment expense increased by $0.3 million and $1.2 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The increases for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to growth in our office footprint and annual increases on our existing office space. Our cost of FDIC and regulatory fees increased by $1.1 million and
$2.6 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The changes were due to balance sheet growth and changes in product mix at the Bank. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC. Broker-dealer clearing charges for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were relatively unchanged from the three months ended December 31, 2021. Broker-dealer clearing charges decreased $1.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to reduced customer trading activity. General and administrative costs decreased by $1.3 million and increased by $14.1 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a net benefit for credit losses for unfunded commitments in the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net provision for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to a $16.0 million accrual in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of an adverse legal judgement that has not been finalized, partially offset by a net benefit for credit losses for unfunded commitments in the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net provision for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense was $35.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $25.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and $60.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $50.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Our effective income tax rates (income tax provision divided by net income before income tax) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 30.42% and 29.59%, respectively. Our effective income tax rates for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 30.04% and 29.34%, respectively.
SEGMENT RESULTS Our Company determines reportable segments based on what separate financial information is available and what segment results are evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company operates through two operating segments: Banking Business and Securities Business. In order to reconcile the two segments to the unaudited condensed consolidated totals, the Company includes parent-only activities and intercompany eliminations. The following tables present the operating results of the segments: 39 Table of Contents For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Banking Business Securities Business Corporate/Eliminations Axos Consolidated Net interest income $ 198,545  $ 4,876  $ (3,511) $ 199,910  Provision for credit losses 3,500  —  —  3,500  Non-interest income 10,557  36,004  (18,232) 28,329  Non-interest expense 96,284  25,271  (14,027) 107,528  Income before taxes $ 109,318  $ 15,609  $ (7,716) $ 117,211  For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Banking Business Securities Business Corporate/Eliminations Axos Consolidated Net interest income $ 142,259  $ 4,506  $ (1,197) $ 145,568  Provision for credit losses 4,000  —  —  4,000  Non-interest income 16,295  16,454  (1,962) 30,787  Non-interest expense 62,449  21,654  1,916  86,019  Income before taxes $ 92,105  $ (694) $ (5,075) $ 86,336  For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Banking Business Securities Business Corporate/Eliminations Axos Consolidated Net interest income $ 378,275  $ 9,151  $ (7,041) $ 380,385  Provision for credit losses 12,250  —  —  12,250  Non-interest income 21,269  65,169  (30,901) 55,537  Non-interest expense 197,080  49,786  (23,251) 223,615  Income before taxes $ 190,214  $ 24,534  $ (14,691) $ 200,057  For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Banking Business Securities Business Corporate/Eliminations Axos Consolidated Net interest income $ 284,500  $ 10,682  $ (2,972) $ 292,210  Provision for credit losses 8,000  —  —  8,000  Non-interest income 31,123  29,560  (3,194) 57,489  Non-interest expense 125,174  40,927  4,349  170,450  Income before taxes $ 182,449  $ (685) $ (10,515) $ 171,249  Banking Business For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our Banking Business segment had income before taxes of $109 million compared to income before taxes of $92.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Banking Business segment had income before taxes of $190 million compared to income before taxes of $182.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in income before taxes compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, was mainly due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense and lower non-interest income. 40 Table of Contents We consider the ratios shown in the table below to be key indicators of the performance of our Banking Business segment:

The increase for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to higher average balances and rates earned in the loan portfolio, higher rates on deposits placed with other financial institutions and a higher average balance of non-interest bearing deposits, partially offset by higher rates paid on deposits. The Banking Business segment’s non-interest income decreased $5.7 million to $10.6 million and decreased $9.9 million to $21.3 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The decreases for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, were mainly the result of lower mortgage banking income and prepayment penalty fee income as higher mortgage rates contributed to lower originations and a reduction in the fair value of our MSRs, and slower prepayments, respectively.
The Banking Business segment’s non-interest expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $33.8 million and $71.9 million, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 the increases compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, were primarily due to higher advertising and promotional expenses, primarily due to amounts paid to our Securities Business segment for non-interest bearing deposits, higher salaries and related costs as a result of higher headcount and an increase in salaries, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a $16.0 million accrual in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of an adverse legal judgement that has not been finalized.
44 Table of Contents Securities Business For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our Securities Business segment had income before taxes of $15.6 million compared to a loss before taxes of $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, our Securities Business segment had income before taxes of $24.5 million compared to a loss before taxes of $0.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increases for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of higher non-interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense. Net interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $0.4 million to $4.9 million compared to $4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of higher cash deposit balances and rates. Net interest income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $1.5 million to $9.2 million compared to $10.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower securities lending activity, partially offset by higher cash deposit balances and rates. Non-interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $19.6 million to $36.0 million compared to $16.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Non-interest income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $35.6 million to $65.2 million compared to $29.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increases were primarily a result of an increase in fees earned on FDIC-insured bank deposits, including amounts received from our Banking Business segment. Non-interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022
increased $3.6 million to $25.3 million compared to $21.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Non-interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $8.9 million to $49.8 million compared to $40.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher headcount and an increase in salaries, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022 the increase was also attributable to higher professional services expense.

The increase in total assets was primarily due to a $1.4 billion increase in loans. Total liabilities increased $1.2 billion, primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in deposits, partially offset by a $0.3 billion decrease in securities loaned. 45 Table of Contents Loans Net loans held for investment increased 9.8% to $15.5 billion at December 31, 2022 from $14.1 billion at June 30, 2022 primarily due to loan originations of $4.5 billion, partially offset by repayments and other changes of $3.1 billion.

The Bank’s lending guidelines for interest only loans are adjusted for the increased credit risk associated with these loans by requiring borrowers with such loans to borrow at loan-to-values (“LTVs”) that are lower than standard amortizing ARM loans and by calculating debt to income ratios for qualifying borrowers based upon a fully amortizing payment, not the interest only payment. The Bank monitors and performs reviews of interest only loans as part of its loan portfolio management process. Adverse trends reflected in the Company’s delinquency statistics, grading and classification of interest only loans would be reported to management and the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.3 billion of interest only mortgage loans with a weighted average LTV of 58.5%.
Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Non-performing Assets Non-performing loans are comprised of those past due 90 days or more and other nonaccrual loans. Non-performing assets include non-performing loans plus other real estate owned and repossessed vehicles. At December 31, 2022, our non-performing loans totaled $95.0 million, or 0.61% of total gross loans and our total non-performing assets totaled $100.8 million, or 0.54% of total assets. Non-performing loans and foreclosed assets or “non-performing assets” consisted of the following as of the dates indicated: (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Inc (Dec) Non-performing assets: Non-accrual loans: Single Family - Mortgage & Warehouse $ 39,043  $ 66,424  $ (27,381) Multifamily and Commercial Mortgage 35,275  33,410  1,865  Commercial Real Estate 14,852  14,852  —  Commercial & Industrial - Non-RE 2,989  2,989  —  Auto & Consumer 1,447  439  1,008  Other 1,382  80  1,302  Total non-performing loans 94,988  118,194  (23,206) Foreclosed real estate 4,383  —  4,383  Repossessed—Autos 1,421  798  623  Total non-performing assets $ 100,792  $ 118,992  $ (18,200) Total non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.61  % 0.83  % (0.22) % Total non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.54  % 0.68  % (0.14) % 46 Table of Contents Total non-performing assets decreased from $119.0 million at June 30, 2022 to $100.8 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in non-performing assets was primarily attributable to a decrease in non-accrual single family mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase in other non-performing loans and foreclosed real estate. The weighted average LTV of the
single family mortgage loans remaining on non-accrual at December 31, 2022 was 59.8%. The Bank had no performing troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. A troubled debt restructuring is a concession made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties, typically permanent or temporary modifications of principal and interest payments or an extension of maturity dates. When a loan is delinquent and classified as a troubled debt restructuring, no interest is accrued until the borrower demonstrates over time (typically six months) that it can make payments. When a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring and is on nonaccrual, it is considered non-performing and included in the table above.
Management establishes an allowance for credit losses based upon its evaluation of the expected life-time credit losses related to the amortized cost basis of loans on the balance sheet. For additional information regarding the Company’s allowance for credit losses see Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of the provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, see “Results of Operations—Provision for Credit Losses.” We believe that the lower average LTV in the Bank’s mortgage loan portfolio will continue to result in future lower average mortgage loan charge-offs when compared to many other comparable banks. We do not expect the resolution of the Bank’s existing other real estate owned and non-performing loans will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.
Investment Securities Total investment securities was $248.4 million as of December 31, 2022, compared with $264.3 million at June 30, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we did not purchase any securities and received principal repayments of approximately $9.1 million in our available-for-sale portfolio. The remainder of the change for the available-for-sale portfolio is attributable to unrealized losses, accretion and other changes. Deposits Deposits increased by $1.7 billion, or 12.5%, to $15.7 billion at December 31, 2022, from $13.9 billion at June 30, 2022. Interest-bearing demand and savings increased $3.3 billion and time deposits increased $21.9 million. Non-interest bearing deposits decreased $1.6 billion, or 31.6%, to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2022, from $5.0 billion at June 30, 2022.

We regularly use advances from the FHLB to manage our interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, manage our liquidity position. Generally, FHLB advances with terms between three and ten years have been used to fund the purchase of single family and multifamily mortgages and to provide us with interest rate risk protection should rates rise.
Stockholders’ Equity Stockholders’ equity increased $144.6 million to $1,787.6 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $1,643.0 million at June 30, 2022. The increase was the result of net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of $140.0 million and stock compensation expense and restricted stock unit vesting which combined for an increase of $8.6 million, partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not repurchase any common stock shares. The Company has $52.8 million remaining under the Board authorized stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2022. 48 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY Cash flow information is as follows:
For the Six Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Operating Activities $ 177,076  $ (72,501) Investing Activities $ (1,411,404) $ (1,136,966) Financing Activities $ 1,612,142  $ 1,290,048  During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we had net cash inflows from operating activities of $177.1 million compared to outflows of $72.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Net operating cash inflows and outflows fluctuate primarily due to the timing of the following: originations of loans held for sale, proceeds from loan sales, securities borrowed and loaned, and customer, broker-dealer and clearing receivables and payables and changes in other assets and payables. Net cash outflows from investing activities totaled $1,411.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, while outflows totaled $1,132.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in outflows was primarily due to lower principal repayments on loans held for investment, partially offset by lower loan originations. Net cash inflows from financing activities totaled $1,612.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash inflows from financing activities of $1,290.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The primary driver behind the increase in net cash inflows was a larger net increase in deposits for the six months ended December 31, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Bank could borrow up to 40.0% of its total assets from the FHLB. Borrowings are collateralized by the pledge of certain mortgage loans and investment securities to the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $2,250.4 million available immediately and $4,677.9 million available with additional collateral. At December 31, 2022, we also had three unsecured federal funds purchase lines with three different banks totaling $200 million, under which no borrowings were outstanding. The Bank has the ability to borrow short-term from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Discount Window. At December 31, 2022, the Bank did not have any borrowings outstanding and the amount available from this source was $2,880.6 million. The credit line is collateralized by consumer loans and mortgage-backed securities. Axos Clearing has a total of $150 million in uncommitted secured lines of credit for borrowing as needed. As of December 31, 2022, there was no amount outstanding. These credit facilities bear interest at rates based on the Federal Funds rate and are due upon demand.
Axos Clearing has a $190 million committed unsecured line of credit available for limited purpose borrowing, which includes $100 million from Axos Financial, Inc. As of December 31, 2022, there was no amount outstanding on this credit facility after elimination of intercompany balances. This credit facility bears interest at rates based on the Federal Funds rate and is due upon demand.
We believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate for our anticipated needs and contingencies for the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we have the ability to increase our level of deposits and borrowings to address our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS At December 31, 2022, we had commitments to originate loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $3,049.6 million, and commitments to sell loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $4.6 million.
We have no commitments to purchase loans, investment securities or any other unused lines of credit. In the normal course of business, Axos Clearing’s customer activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various customer securities transactions. These activities may expose Axos Clearing to off-balance-sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contracted obligations and Axos Clearing has to purchase or sell the financial instrument underlying the contract at a loss. Axos Clearing’s clearing agreements with broker-dealers for which it provides clearing services requires them to indemnify Axos Clearing if customers fail to satisfy their contractual obligation. 49 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS Our Company and Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal bank regulatory agencies. Failure by our Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for our Company and the OCC has similar requirements for our Bank. Under these capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, our Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our Company and Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require our Company and Bank to maintain certain minimum capital amounts and ratios. Federal bank regulators require our Company and Bank to maintain minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets of 4.0%, common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% and total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. To be “well capitalized,” our Company and Bank must maintain minimum leverage, common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 5.0%, 6.5%, 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2022, our Company and Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject and were “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since December 31, 2022 that would materially adversely change the Company’s and Bank’s capital classifications. From time to time, we may need to raise additional capital to support our Company’s and Bank’s further growth and to maintain their “well capitalized” status. The Company and Bank both elected the five-year current expected credit losses (“CECL”) transition guidance for calculating regulatory capital and ratios and the December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 amounts reflect this election. This guidance allowed an entity to add back to regulatory capital 100% of the impact of the day one CECL transition adjustment and 25% of subsequent increases to the allowance for credit losses through June 30, 2022. Beginning with fiscal year 2023, this cumulative amount is phased out of regulatory capital at 25% per year until it is 100% phased out of regulatory capital beginning in fiscal year 2026. 50 Table of Contents The Company’s and Bank’s estimated capital amounts, capital ratios and capital requirements under Basel III were as follows: Axos Financial, Inc.

The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of common equity tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not the leverage ratio. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, our Company and Bank were in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirement, which sets the common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratio minimums to
7.0% ,
8.5%
and
10.5% , respectively. Securities Business Pursuant to the net capital requirements of the Exchange Act, Axos Clearing, is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital (Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act). Under this rule, the Company has elected to operate under the alternate method and is required to maintain minimum net capital of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions, as defined. Under the alternate method, the Company may not repay subordinated debt, pay cash distributions, or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement. The net capital positions of Axos Clearing were as follows:
(Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Net capital $ 60,334  $ 38,915  Excess Capital $ 55,977  $ 32,665  Net capital as a percentage of aggregate debit items 27.69  % 12.45  % Net capital in excess of 5% aggregate debit items $ 49,441  $ 23,290  Axos Clearing, as a clearing broker, is subject to SEC Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act) which requires segregation of funds in a special reserve account for the benefit of customers. At December 31, 2022, the Company calculated a deposit requirement of $189.6 million and maintained a deposit of $182.3 million. On January 3, 2023, the Company made a deposit of $16.8 million. Certain broker-dealers have chosen to main tain brokerage customer accounts at Axos Clearing. To allow these broker-dealers to classify their assets held by the Company as allowable assets in their computation of net capital, the Company
51 Table of Contents computes a separate reserve requirement for Proprietary Accounts of Brokers (PAB). At December 31, 2022, the Company calculated a deposit requirement of $20.1 million and maintained a deposit of $14.3 million. On January 3, 2023, the Company made a withdrawal in the amount of $6.8 million. ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK For further discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in the 2022 Form 10-K. We measure interest rate sensitivity as the difference between amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that mature or contractually re-price within a given period of time. The difference, or the interest rate sensitivity gap, provides an indication of the extent to which an institution’s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would be in a better position than an institution with a negative gap to invest in higher yielding assets or to have its asset yields adjusted upward, which would cause the yield on its assets to increase at a faster pace than the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities. During a period of falling interest rates, however, an institution with a positive gap would tend to have its assets reprice at a faster rate than one with a negative gap, which would tend to reduce the growth in its net interest income. Banking Business The following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that were outstanding at December 31, 2022 and the portions of each financial instrument that are expected to mature or reset interest rates in each future period:

The loan and securities prepayment rates reflected herein are based on historical experience. For the non-maturity deposit liabilities, we
52 Table of Contents use decay rates and rate adjustments based upon our historical experience. Actual repayments of these instruments could vary substantially if future experience differs from our historic experience. Although “gap” analysis is a useful measurement device available to management in determining the existence of interest rate exposure, its static focus as of a particular date makes it necessary to utilize other techniques in measuring exposure to changes in interest rates. For example, gap analysis is limited in its ability to predict trends in future earnings and makes no assumptions about changes in prepayment tendencies, deposit or loan maturity preferences or repricing time lags that may occur in response to a change in the interest rate environment. The following table indicates the sensitivity of net interest income movements to parallel instantaneous shocks in interest rates for the future 1-12 months and 13-24 months’ time periods.
For purposes of modeling net interest income sensitivity, we assume no growth in the balance sheet other than for retained earnings: As of December 31, 2022 First 12 Months Next 12 Months (Dollars in thousands) Net Interest Income Percentage Change from Base Net Interest Income Percentage Change from Base Up 200 basis points $ 763,885  8.8  % $ 893,723  6.5  % Base $ 701,953  —  % $ 839,332  —  % Down 200 basis points $ 637,273  (9.2) % $ 773,026  (7.9) % We attempt to measure the effect market interest rate changes will have on the net present value of assets and liabilities, which is defined as market value of equity. We analyze the market value of equity sensitivity to an immediate parallel and sustained shift in interest rates derived from the underlying interest rate curves. The following table indicates the sensitivity of market value of equity to the interest rate movement described above: As of December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Net Present Value Percentage Change from Base Net Present Value as a Percentage of Assets Up 200 basis points $ 1,710,148  (5.8) % 9.9  % Up 100 basis points $ 1,780,406  (2.0) % 10.2  % Base $ 1,816,327  —  % 10.3  % Down 100 basis points $ 1,800,479  (0.9) % 10.1  % Down 200 basis points $ 1,712,806  (5.7) % 9.5  % The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of interest rates, asset prepayments, runoffs in deposits and changes in repricing levels of deposits to general market rates, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Furthermore, these computations do not take into account any actions that we may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates. Those actions include, but are not limited to, making change in loan and deposit interest rates and changes in our asset and liability mix. Securities Business Our Securities Business is exposed to market risk primarily due to its role as a financial intermediary in customer transactions, which may include purchases and sales of securities, securities lending activities, and in our trading activities, which are used to support sales, underwriting and other customer activities. We are subject to the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, investor expectations and changes in credit ratings of the issuer. Our Securities Business is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and other interest earning assets, including customer and correspondent margin loans and securities borrowing activities. Our exposure to interest rate risk is also from our funding sources including customer and correspondent cash balances, bank borrowings and securities lending activities. Interest rates on customer and correspondent balances and securities produce a positive spread with rates generally fluctuating in parallel. 53 Table of Contents With respect to securities held, our interest rate risk is managed by setting and monitoring limits on the size and duration of positions and on the length of time securities can be held. Many of the interest rates on customer and correspondent margin loans are indexed and can vary daily. Our funding sources are generally short term with interest rates that can vary daily. Our Securities Business is engaged in various brokerage and trading activities that expose us to credit risk arising from potential non-performance from counterparties, customers or issuers of securities. This risk is managed by setting and monitoring position limits for each counterparty, conducting periodic credit reviews of counterparties, reviewing concentrations of securities and conducting business through central clearing organizations. Collateral underlying margin loans to customers and correspondents and with respect to securities lending activities is marked to market daily and additional collateral is required as necessary. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer along with our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In addition, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 54 Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The information set forth in Note 8 – “ Commitments And Contingencies ” to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, from time to time we may be a party to other claims or litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims to enforce liens, claims involving the origination and servicing of loans, and other issues related to the Company’s business operations. None of such matters are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or business. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and our industry. These risks are described in more detail under Part 1, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2022 Form 10-K, as supplemented by the risks described below. We encourage you to read these factors in their entirety. Moreover, other factors may also exist that we cannot anticipate or that we currently do not consider to be significant based on information that is currently available.
Liquidity and access to adequate funding cannot be assured. Liquidity is essential to our business and the inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, equity and debt offerings, or other sources could have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity. The Bank may become unable to meet the cash flow requirements of its customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Company specific factors such as a decline in our credit rating (for which a rating agency recently announced a review for downgrade), an increase in the cost of capital from financial capital markets, a decrease in business activity due to adverse regulatory action or other company specific event, or a decrease in depositor or investor confidence may impair our access to funding with acceptable terms adequate to finance our activities. General factors related to the financial services industry such as a severe disruption in financial markets, a decrease in industry expectations, or a decrease in business activity due to political or environmental events may impair our access to liquidity. We rely primarily upon deposits and FHLB advances. Our ability to attract deposits could be negatively impacted by a public perception of our financial prospects or by increased deposit rates available at troubled institutions suffering from shortfalls in liquidity. The FHLB advances and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco discount window are subject to regulation and other factors beyond our control. These factors may adversely affect the availability and pricing of advances to members such as the Bank. Selected sources of liquidity may become unavailable to the Bank if it were to no longer be considered “well-capitalized”. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 2.
