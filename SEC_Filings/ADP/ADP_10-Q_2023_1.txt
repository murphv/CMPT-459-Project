See notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 6 Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts or where otherwise stated) (Unaudited) Note 1.   Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its subsidiaries and variable interest entity (“ADP” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).  The Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto are unaudited.  In the opinion of the Company’s management, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s interim financial results. The Company has a grantor trust, which holds the majority of the funds provided by its clients pending remittance to employees of those clients, tax authorities, and other payees.  The Company is the sole beneficial owner of the trust.  The trust meets the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation” to be characterized as a variable interest entity (“VIE”).  The Company has determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the trust because it has both (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust (including the power to make all investment decisions for the trust) and (2) the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trust (in the form of investment returns) and, therefore, consolidates the trust.  Further information on these funds and the Company’s obligations to remit to its clients’ employees, tax authorities, and other payees is provided in Note 6, “Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.”  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”). Note 2.   New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
None. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements None. Note 3.   Revenue Based upon similar operational and economic characteristics, the Company’s revenues are disaggregated by its three strategic pillars: Human Capital Management (“HCM”), HR Outsourcing (“HRO”), and Global (“Global”) Solutions, with separate disaggregation for PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through revenues and client funds interest revenues.
The Company believes these revenue categories depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
The following tables provide details of revenue by our strategic pillars, and include a reconciliation to the Company’s reportable segments: 7 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, Types of Revenues 2022 2021 2022 2021 HCM $ 1,861.8   $ 1,743.8   $ 3,672.8   $ 3,410.4   HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs 853.9   758.7   1,631.2   1,438.0   PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs 944.2   863.9   1,890.0   1,703.4   Global 543.9   553.0   1,084.3   1,098.8   Interest on funds held for clients 187.2   106.0   328.3   207.1   Total Revenues $ 4,391.0   $ 4,025.4   $ 8,606.6   $ 7,857.7   Reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to our reportable segments for the three months ended December 31, 2022: Types of Revenues Employer Services PEO Other Total HCM $ 1,864.1   $ —   $ ( 2.3 ) $ 1,861.8   HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs 298.4   557.4   ( 1.9 ) 853.9   PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs —   944.2   —   944.2   Global 543.9   —   —   543.9   Interest on funds held for clients 185.5   1.7   —   187.2   Total Segment Revenues $ 2,891.9   $ 1,503.3   $ ( 4.2 ) $ 4,391.0   Reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to our reportable segments for the three months ended December 31, 2021: Types of Revenues Employer Services PEO Other Total HCM $ 1,745.7   $ —   $ ( 1.9 ) $ 1,743.8   HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs 267.8   493.7   ( 2.8 ) 758.7   PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs —   863.9   —   863.9   Global 553.0   —   —   553.0   Interest on funds held for clients 104.8   1.2   —   106.0   Total Segment Revenues $ 2,671.3   $ 1,358.8   $ ( 4.7 ) $ 4,025.4   Reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to our reportable segments for the six months ended December 31, 2022: Types of Revenues Employer Services PEO Other Total HCM $ 3,677.4   $ —   $ ( 4.6 ) $ 3,672.8   HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs 595.2   1,039.7   ( 3.7 ) 1,631.2   PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs —   1,890.0   —   1,890.0   Global 1,084.3   —   —   1,084.3   Interest on funds held for clients 325.3   3.0   —   328.3   Total Segment Revenues $ 5,682.2   $ 2,932.7   $ ( 8.3 ) $ 8,606.6   8 Reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to our reportable segments for the six months ended December 31, 2021: Types of Revenues Employer Services PEO Other Total HCM $ 3,414.7   $ —   $ ( 4.3 ) $ 3,410.4   HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs 524.1   917.6   ( 3.7 ) 1,438.0   PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs —   1,703.4   —   1,703.4   Global 1,098.8   —   —   1,098.8   Interest on funds held for clients 205.2   1.9   —   207.1   Total Segment Revenues $ 5,242.8   $ 2,622.9   $ ( 8.0 ) $ 7,857.7   Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition for HCM, HRO and Global Solutions is consistent with the invoicing of clients, as invoicing occurs in the period the services are provided. Therefore, the Company does not recognize a contract asset or liability resulting from the timing of revenue recognition and invoicing. Changes in short-term deferred revenues related to set up fees for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were as follows: Contract Liability Contract liability, July 1, 2022 $ 468.2   Recognition of revenue included in beginning of year contract liability ( 33.5 ) Contract liability, net of revenue recognized on contracts during the period 28.8   Currency translation adjustments ( 8.9 ) Contract liability, December 31, 2022 $ 454.6   Note 4.   Earnings per Share (“EPS”) Basic Effect of Employee Stock Option Shares Effect of Employee Restricted Stock Shares Diluted Three Months Ended December 31, 2022         Net earnings $ 813.1       $ 813.1   Weighted average shares (in millions) 414.3   1.0   0.9   416.2   EPS $ 1.96       $ 1.95   Three Months Ended December 31, 2021         Net earnings $ 694.4       $ 694.4   Weighted average shares (in millions) 419.8   1.2   1.0   422.0   EPS $ 1.65       $ 1.65   Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Net earnings $ 1,592.2       $ 1,592.2   Weighted average shares (in millions) 414.4   1.1   1.1   416.6   EPS $ 3.84       $ 3.82   Six Months Ended December 31, 2021         Net earnings $ 1,394.9       $ 1,394.9   Weighted average shares (in millions) 420.6   1.2   1.1   422.9   EPS $ 3.32       $ 3.30   For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, there were

million, $ 214.0
million, and $ 33.2
million,
respectively. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of the

(b) - Long-term marketable securities are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funds held for clients represent assets that, based upon the Company's intent, are restricted for use solely for the purposes of satisfying the obligations to remit funds relating to the Company’s payroll and payroll tax filing services, which are classified as client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funds held for clients have been invested in the following categories: December 31, June 30, 2022 2022 Funds held for clients:     Restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations $ 11,937.5   $ 21,346.7   Restricted short-term marketable securities held to satisfy client funds obligations 3,294.3   4,263.1   Restricted long-term marketable securities held to satisfy client funds obligations 25,528.7   23,959.4   Total funds held for clients $ 40,760.5   $ 49,569.2   Client funds obligations represent the Company's contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy clients' payroll, tax, and other payee payment obligations and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time that the Company impounds funds from clients. The client funds obligations represent liabilities that will be repaid within
one year
of the balance sheet date. The Company has reported client funds obligations as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets totaling
$ 43,061.8
million
and $ 51,285.5
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company has classified funds held for clients as a current asset since these funds are held solely for the purpose of satisfying the client funds obligations. Of the Company’s funds held for clients at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 , $ 37,371.5
million and $ 46,201.2
million, respectively, are held in the grantor trust. The liabilities held within the trust are intercompany liabilities to other Company subsidiaries and are eliminated in consolidation. The Company has reported the cash flows related to the purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities and related to the proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client funds marketable securities on a gross basis in the investing section of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The Company has reported the cash and cash equivalents related to client funds investments with original maturities of
ninety days or less , within the beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents. The Company has reported the cash flows related to the
13 cash received from and paid on behalf of clients on a net basis within net increase / (decrease) in client funds obligations in the financing activities section of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. All available-for-sale securities were rated as investment grade at December 31, 2022.   Expected maturities of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2022 are as follows: One year or less $ 3,310.7   One year to two years 5,854.5   Two years to three years 6,497.9   Three years to four years 5,978.0   After four years 7,198.3   Total available-for-sale securities $ 28,839.4   Note 7.   Leases The Company records leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, records the current portion of operating lease liabilities within
accrued expenses and other current liabilities
and, separately, records long-term operating lease liabilities. The difference between total ROU assets and total lease liabilities is primarily attributable to pre-payments of our obligations and the recognition of various lease incentives.
The Company has entered into operating lease agreements for facilities and equipment. The Company's leases have remaining lease terms of up to approximately  eleven years .
The components of operating lease expense were as follows:
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 32.1   $ 36.7   $ 67.8   $ 72.5   Short-term lease cost 0.4   0.2   0.7   0.5   Variable lease cost 3.9   2.9   6.8   5.4   Total operating lease cost $ 36.4   $ 39.8   $ 75.3   $ 78.4   The following table provides supplemental cash flow information related to the Company's leases: Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash paid for operating lease liabilities $ 65.3   $ 64.5   Operating lease ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 18.7   $ 61.1   Other information related to our operating lease liabilities is as follows: December 31, June 30, 2022 2022 Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 6 6 Weighted-average discount rate 2.3   % 2.2   % Current operating lease liability $ 94.7   $ 95.1   14 As of December 31, 2022, maturities of operating lease liabilities are as follows: Six months ending June 30, 2023 $ 55.7   Twelve months ending June 30, 2024 91.6   Twelve months ending June 30, 2025 75.7   Twelve months ending June 30, 2026 66.2   Twelve months ending June 30, 2027 58.9   Thereafter 110.1   Total undiscounted lease obligations 458.2   Less: Imputed interest ( 29.4 ) Net lease obligations $ 428.8   Note 8.

5
years ( 6
years for software and software licenses,
3
years for customer contracts and lists, and
2
years for other intangibles). Amortization of intangible assets was $ 93.7
million and $ 84.3

Short-term Financing The Company has a $ 3.75
billion,
364 -day credit agreement that matures in June 2023 with a
one year
term-out option. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings under the agreement is tied to SOFR, the effective funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company also has a $ 2.75
billion,
five year
credit facility that matures in June 2024 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $ 500
million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. In addition, the Company has a
five year,
$ 3.2
billion credit facility maturing in June 2026 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $ 500
million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate, depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had
no
borrowings through December 31, 2022 under the credit agreements. The Company's U.S. short-term funding requirements primarily related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $ 9.7
billion in aggregate maturity value. The Company’s commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to
364
days. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had
no
commercial paper borrowing outstanding.
Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Average daily borrowings (in billions) $ 3.4   $ 1.9   $ 4.0   $ 1.9   Weighted average interest rates 3.5   % 0.1   % 2.8   % 0.1   % Weighted average maturity (approximately in days) 2

day The Company’s U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to
five
business days. At December 31, 2022, there were
no
outstanding obligations related to repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 136.4  million of outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements.
Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Average outstanding balances $ 960.8   $ 228.4   $ 1,040.1   $ 211.7   Weighted average interest rates 3.4   % 0.2   % 2.9   % 0.2   % 16 Note 10.
Debt The Company issued three series of fixed-rate notes with staggered maturities of
7
and
10 -years totaling $ 3.0
billion
(collectively the “Notes”).
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, semi-annually. The principal amounts and associated effective interest rates of the Notes and other debt as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, are as follows:
Debt instrument Effective Interest Rate December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Fixed-rate
3.375 % notes due September 15, 2025 3.47 % $ 1,000.0   $ 1,000.0   Fixed-rate

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs.
As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $ 2,623.1
million. For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the Company's fair value methodologies, including the use of an independent third-party pricing service, see Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022.

Employee Benefit Plans A.  Stock-based Compensation Plans.
Stock-based compensation consists of the following: The Company's share-based compensation consists of stock options, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock, and performance-based restricted stock units. The Company also offers an employee stock purchase plan for eligible employees. Beginning in September 2022, the Company discontinued granting stock options, time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock. Other than the change described above, the methods and assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of stock-based awards are generally consistent with those described in the Company's Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. See the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 for a detailed description of the Company's stock-based compensation awards and employee stock purchase plan. The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock awards. From time to time, the
Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company repurchase d
0.9
million and
2.0
million shares in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and repurchased
2.3
million
and
4.6
million shares in the
six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company considers several
factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
The following table represents pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Operating expenses $ 6.5   $ 5.2   $ 12.5   $ 9.9   Selling, general and administrative expenses 44.4   42.7   81.5   74.1   System development and programming costs 7.5   7.7   15.0   13.9   Total stock-based compensation expense $ 58.4   $ 55.6   $ 109.0   $ 97.9   B.  Pension Plans The components of net pension income were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Service cost – benefits earned during the period $ 1.2   $ 1.4   $ 2.3   $ 2.8   Interest cost on projected benefits 19.5   13.1   39.0   26.2   Expected return on plan assets ( 31.8 ) ( 32.0 ) ( 63.7 ) ( 64.0 ) Net amortization and deferral 0.4   1.7   1.0   3.4   Settlement charges and special termination benefits —   —   1.4   —   Net pension (income)/expense $ ( 10.7 ) $ ( 15.8 ) $ ( 20.0 ) $ ( 31.6 ) 18 Note 12.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
23.2 % and
23.7 %, respectively. The
decrease is primarily due to favorable adjustments to prior year tax liabilities partially offset by a decrease in the excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
23.0 %. The rate remained flat due to favorable adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 offset by lower reserves for uncertain tax positions and a valuation allowance release in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Note 13.
Commitments and Contingencies In May 2020,
two
potential class action complaints were filed against ADP, TotalSource and related defendants in the U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey. The complaints assert violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) in connection with the ADP TotalSource Retirement Savings Plan’s fiduciary administrative and investment decision-making. The complaints seek statutory and other unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees. These claims are still in their early stages and the Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of loss, with respect to these matters. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits. The Company is subject to various claims, litigation, and regulatory compliance matters in the normal course of business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss. Management currently believes that the resolution of these claims, litigation and regulatory compliance matters against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. It is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. 19 Note 14.

Interim Financial Data by Segment Based upon similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company’s strategic business units have been aggregated into the following
two
reportable segments: Employer Services and PEO Services. The primary components of the “Other” segment are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and interest expense. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility.

investments in our sales organization, increased marketing expenses, and increased travel expenses.
Interest ex pense increased fo r the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the increase of weighted average interest rates on commercial paper issuances to 3.5% from 0.1%, coupled with a higher volume of average commercial paper borrowings, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Earnings Before Income Taxes ("EBIT") and Adjusted EBIT
For the three and six months ended December 31: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 YoY Growth 2022 2021 YoY Growth EBIT $ 1,058.1  $ 910.1  16  % $ 2,068.1  $ 1,810.9  14  %   EBIT Margin 24.1  % 22.6  % 150 bps 24.0  % 23.0  % 100 bps Adjusted EBIT $ 1,069.0  $ 929.8  15  % $ 2,086.4  $ 1,845.0  13  %   Adjusted EBIT Margin 24.3  % 23.1  % 120 bps 24.2  % 23.5  % 80 bps Earnings before income taxes increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, due to the components discussed above. Margin increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, due to increases in revenues discussed above, and operating efficiencies for costs of servicing our clients on growing revenue, partially offset by increased interest expense, and increased selling expense.
Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin exclude interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strate gy, legal settlements, and net charges related to our broad-based transformation initiatives and the impact of net severance charges, as applicable, in the respective periods.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 23.2% and 23.7%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable adjustments to prior year tax liabilities partially offset by a decrease in the excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation in the three months ende d
December 31, 2022. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 23.0%. The rate remained flat due to favorable adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 offset by lower reserves for uncertain tax positions and a valuation allowance release in the six months ended December 31, 2021. 28 Net Earnings and Diluted EPS, Unadjusted and Adjusted For the three and six months ended December 31: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 YoY Growth 2022 2021 YoY Growth Net earnings

For the three months ended December 31, 2022, in addition to the increase in net earnings, diluted EPS increased as a result of the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of approximately 0.9 million shares during the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2.0 million shares during the three months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.

PEO Services' margin increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 due to the increase in revenues discussed above, a favorable impact of zero-margin benefits pass-throughs and operating efficiencies, partially offset by increases in selling expenses.
ADP Indemnity provides workers’ compensation and employer’s liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services’ worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured
aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment.  31 Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote.
ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $0.6 million and $15.2 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to approximately $3.7 million and $14.6 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily a result of changes in our estimated actuarial losses. In July 2022,
ADP Indemnity paid a premium of
$284 million t o enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb Limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the
fiscal 2023 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2022 reinsurance policy.
Other The primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and other interest income and expense. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:
Adjusted Financial Measure U.S. GAAP Measures Adjusted EBIT Net earnings
Adjusted provision for income taxes
Provision for income taxes Adjusted net earnings

Adjusted diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share Adjusted effective tax rate
Effective tax rate Organic constant currency Revenues We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies. 32 Three Months Ended % Change Six Months Ended % Change December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 As Reported 2022 2021 As Reported Net earnings

The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “All other interest expense” and “All other interest income.” (b) In the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, transformation initiatives include consulting costs relating to our company wide transformation initiatives, partially offset by net reversals relating to severance. Unlike other severance charges which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions taken as part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. (c) Represents insurance recovery from a legal settlement charge previously recorded. (d) The income tax (benefit)/provision was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. (e) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes. 33 The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction.
The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.
The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.

For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our
$9.7 billion
of co mmitted credit facilities and our ability to access both
long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.
Our financial condition remains solid at December 31, 2022 and we have sufficient liquidity.
For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper. 34 Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are summarized as follows:
Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change Cash provided by / (used in): Operating activities $ 1,617.8  $ 1,215.6  $ 402.2  Investing activities (1,469.4) (3,468.4) 1,999.0  Financing activities (9,624.3) 9,664.7  (19,289.0) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents (24.6) (20.9) (3.7) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents $ (9,500.5) $ 7,391.0  $ (16,891.5) Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our underlying business (net income adjusted for non-cash adjustments), and a net favorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to timing on collections of accounts receivable and a decrease in incentive compensation payments, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Net cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the timing of purchases and proceeds of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $2,044.9 million.
Net cash flows used in financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of
$19,512.6 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, net payments related to reverse repurchase agreements, and an increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock in the six months ended December 31, 2022. We purchased approximately 2.3 million shares
of our common stock at an average price per sha re o f
$234.87
duri ng the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to purchases of 4.6 million shares at an average price per share of $213.79 during the six months ended December 31, 2021. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions. Capital Resources and Client Funds Obligations We have $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028 and 2030.
We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our long-term financing. Our U.S. short-term funding requirements primarily related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by St andard & Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.
Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Compa ny had no comm ercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows: 35 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Average daily borrowings (in billions) $ 3.4  $ 1.9  $ 4.0  $ 1.9  Weighted average interest rates 3.5  % 0.1  % 2.8  % 0.1  % Weighted average maturity (approximately in days) 2 days 1 day 2 days 1 day Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather
than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligatio ns. At December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding obligations related to repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2022, the Company had $136.4 million of outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Average outstanding balances $ 960.8  $ 228.4  $ 1,040.1  $ 211.7  Weighted average interest rates 3.4  % 0.2  % 2.9  % 0.2  % We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $3.75 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2023 with a one year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year $2.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.2 billion credit facility maturing in June 2024 and June 2026, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through December 31, 2022 under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.7 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. We own AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, equipment lease, and rate reduction receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities has performed as expected through December 31, 2022. In addition, we own U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients. Capital expenditures for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $91.2 million , as compared to $74.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 to be between
$200 million and $225 million,
as compared to $177.1 million in fiscal 2022.
36 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  These assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities. Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.        We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. In circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities or not reinvest maturing securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations. There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.7 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, P-1 by Moody’s, and F1+ by Fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our $9.7 billion committed credit facilities.
The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below. We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for Corporate, Canadian government agency and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB-rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 10 years, and for AA-rated and AAA-rated securities is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf. 37 Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Average investment balances at cost:         Corporate investments $ 5,691.3  $ 3,777.6  $ 6,416.6  $ 4,037.2  Funds held for clients 33,398.5  32,245.5  31,397.5  29,550.1  Total $ 39,089.8  $ 36,023.1  $ 37,814.1  $ 33,587.3          Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized    (gains)/losses on:         Corporate investments 2.0  % 0.9  % 1.8  % 0.9  % Funds held for clients 2.2  % 1.3  % 2.1  % 1.4  % Total 2.2  % 1.3  % 2.0  % 1.3  % Net realized losses/(gains) on available-for-sale securities $ 11.5  $ (0.4) 13.0  $ (0.5)   December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Net unrealized pre-tax (losses)/gains on available-for-sale securities $ (2,301.3) $ (1,721.4) Total available-for-sale securities at fair value $ 28,839.4  $ 28,391.6    We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annu alized interest rate earned on our entire p ortfolio increased from 1.3% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to 2.0% for the six months ended December 31, 2022. A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $13 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $3 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023. We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA-rated and AA- rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian dollar denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government, and United Kingdom government securities. We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. 38 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other comprehensive income.  We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.
Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for changes to our accounting policies effective for the fiscal 2023. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2, New Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The information called for by this item is provided under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” under Item 2 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Item 4.  Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “evaluation”).  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022 in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION Except as noted below, all other items are either inapplicable or would result in negative responses and, therefore, have been omitted. Item 1.  Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation.  While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. With respect to the disclosure of administrative or judicial proceedings arising under any Federal, State, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or that are primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, the Company has determined that the following threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to its business or financial condition:
any proceeding when the potential monetary sanctions exceed $1 million. 39 Item 1A.  Risk Factors There have been no material changes in our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
