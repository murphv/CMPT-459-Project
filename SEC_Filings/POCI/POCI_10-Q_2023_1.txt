PRECISION OPTICS CORPORATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation and Operations
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Precision Optics Corporation, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These consolidated financial statements have been
prepared by the Company, without audit, and reflect normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for
a fair statement of the results of the second quarter and six months of the Company’s fiscal year 2023. These consolidated financial
statements do not include all disclosures associated with annual consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, should be read in
conjunction with footnotes contained in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022, together
with the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm filed under cover of the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K,
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2022.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform
the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period.
Reverse Stock Split
The Company’s Board of Directors authorized
a reverse split of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock within a stated range of 1:1.5 to 1:3, which was subsequently
approved by stockholders holding more than a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at the Company’s Annual Meeting
on April 8, 2022. The Company effected the reverse stock split on a
one-for-three basis
on November 1, 2022 as reported by the Company
on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 2, 2022.
As a result
of the reverse stock split, every three shares of issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and
outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share or the number of the Company’s authorized shares.
The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from
16,915,089
on November 1, 2022 to approximately
5,638,302
shares, after reduction for the elimination of fractional shares.
Unless otherwise noted, all prior year share amounts
and per share calculations throughout this Form 10-Q have been restated to reflect the impact of this 1:3 reverse stock split and to provide
data on a comparable basis. Such restatements include calculations regarding the Company’s weighted-average shares, and earnings
per share, as well as disclosures regarding the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
7
Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing
net income or net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per
share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,
plus the number of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period such as stock options. For the three and six months ended
December 31, 2021, the effect of such securities was antidilutive and not included in the fully diluted calculation because of the net
loss generated during those periods.
The following is the calculation of income (loss) per share for the
three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

The number of shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock

266,981
for the three and six months ended December
31, 2022, respectively, and
889,900
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
In assessing the likelihood of utilization of
existing deferred tax assets, management has considered historical results of operations and the current operating environment. Based
on this evaluation, a full valuation reserve has been provided for the deferred tax assets.
Goodwill and Patents
Long-lived assets such as goodwill and patents
are capitalized when acquired and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of
the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment of the carrying value of long-lived assets such as goodwill and patents would be indicated
if the best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset grouping is less than its carrying value.
If an impairment is indicated, any loss is measured as the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value and is recognized
in operating income or loss. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
No
such impairments of goodwill or patents have been estimated by management as of December 31, 2022.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION
On October 4, 2021, the Company acquired substantially
all of the assets of Lighthouse Imaging, LLC, of Windham, Maine, a medical optics and digital imaging business operating as a designer
and manufacturer of advanced optical imaging systems and accessories with a strong expertise in electrical engineering and development
of end-to-end medical visualization devices. The actual results of operations of the Lighthouse division are included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements as of, and for the three and six months ended, December 31, 2022, and for the three months ended December
31, 2021.
The purchase price for Lighthouse Imaging included
$1,500,000 as potential earn-out consideration over the subsequent two year period, contingent on the Lighthouse division meeting specified
annual gross profit targets. The Lighthouse division did not meet the target for the first $750,000 portion of the earn-out, and the contingent
liability associated with that portion was reversed and recognized as other income in the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022. The second
$750,000 portion of the earn-out contingent liability will be paid if the target level of gross profit is earned by the Lighthouse division
for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023.
Consolidated unaudited actual and pro forma results
of operations for the Company are presented below assuming that the acquisition of the Lighthouse division had occurred on July 1, 2021.
Pro forma operating results include net adjustments resulting from the acquisition transaction during the three months ended September
30, 2021.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are recognized as the performance obligations
to deliver products or services are satisfied and are recorded based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in
exchange for satisfying the performance obligations. Most of the Company’s products and services are marketed to medical device
companies with over 90% of all revenues to customers in the United States. Products and services are primarily transferred to customers
at a point in time based upon when services are performed or product is shipped. Other selling costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are
expensed as incurred due to the short-term nature of a majority of its contracts. The Company extends terms of payment to its customers
based on commercially reasonable terms for the markets of its customers, while also considering their credit quality. Shipping and handling
costs charged to customers are included in revenues.
12
The Company disaggregates revenues by product
and service types as it believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected
by economic factors. Technology rights revenue represent amounts paid by customers for rights to use the Company’s intellectual
property including product designs, patents, and know-how to manufacture and commercialize their products under specified contractual
conditions. Revenues are comprised of the following for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Contract Assets and Liabilities
The nature of the Company’s products and
services does not generally give rise to contract assets as it typically does not incur costs to fulfill a contract before a product or
service is provided to a customer. The Company’s costs to obtain contracts are typically in the form of sales commissions paid to
employees. The Company has elected to expense sales commissions associated with obtaining a contract as incurred as the amortization period
is generally less than one year. These costs have been recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31,
2022, there were no contract assets recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company’s contract liabilities arise
from unearned revenue received from customers at inception of contracts or where the timing of billing for services precedes satisfaction
of our performance obligations. The Company generally satisfies performance obligations within one year from the contract inception date.
Contract liabilities, which were recorded as customer
advances in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and unearned revenue are comprised of the following:

COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The COVID-19 world-wide pandemic that began during
the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and the domestic and international impact of policy decisions being made in major countries around the
world has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company’s sources of supply, current and future orders from
its customers, collection of amounts owed to the Company from its customers, its internal operating procedures, and the Company’s
overall financial condition.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to those
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and with our audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on September 27, 2022.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words anticipate, suggest, estimate, plan, project, continue, ongoing, potential,
expect, predict, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, would and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in this report, the risks described in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe
the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, they relate only to events as of
the date on which the statements are made. We do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report
to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law.
Overview
We have been a developer and manufacturer of advanced
optical instruments since 1982. Our medical instrumentation line includes traditional endoscopes and endocouplers as well as other custom
imaging and illumination products for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures. Much of our recent development efforts have been
targeted at the development of next generation endoscopes. We selectively execute internal research and development programs to develop
next generation capabilities for designing and manufacturing 3D endoscopes and very small Microprecision TM
lenses, anticipating
future requirements as the surgical community continues to demand smaller and more enhanced imaging systems for minimally invasive surgery.
As Ross Optical Industries of El Paso, Texas we
also operate as a supplier of custom optical components and assemblies for military and defense, medical and various other industrial
applications. All products sold by us under the Ross Optical name include a custom or catalog optic, which is sourced through our extensive
domestic and worldwide network of optical fabrication companies. Most systems make use of optical lenses, prisms, mirrors and windows
and range from individual optical components to complex mechano-optical assemblies. Products often include thin film optical coatings
that are applied using our in-house coating department.
As Lighthouse Imaging of Windham, Maine we also
operate as a manufacturer of advanced optical imaging systems and accessories. We have a strong expertise in electrical engineering and
development of end-to-end medical visualization devices. Product development competencies at Lighthouse Imaging include Systems, Optical,
Mechanical, Electrical and Process Development Engineering. Our product development team has extensive experience developing visualization
systems that are used in a variety of clinical applications. Lighthouse Imaging is an industry leader in chip on tip visualization systems.
Approximately 31% our business during the six
months ended December 31, 2022 is from engineering services (primarily relating to the design of medical device optical assemblies), 48%
from the sale of both internally manufactured and purchased optical components, and 16% from the manufacture of optical assemblies and
sub-assemblies (primarily for medical device instrument applications). Our proprietary medical instrumentation line, unique custom design
and manufacturing capabilities, and expert electrical engineering and development services have generated orders for traditional proprietary
endoscopes and endocouplers as well as for custom imaging and illumination products for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures.
We design and manufacture 3D endoscopes and very small Microprecision TM
lenses, assemblies and complete medical devices to
meet the surgical community’s continuing demand for smaller, disposable, and more enhanced imaging systems for minimally invasive
surgery.
We are registered to the ISO 9001:2015 and ISO
13485:2016 Quality Standards and comply with the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices and the European Union Medical Device Directive for
CE marking of our medical products.

The markets in which we do business are highly
competitive and include both foreign and domestic competitors. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources
than we do. Furthermore, other domestic or foreign companies, some with greater financial resources than we have, may seek to produce
products or services that compete with ours. We routinely outsource specialized production efforts as required to obtain the most cost-effective
production. Over the years we have developed extensive experience collaborating with other optical specialists worldwide.
We believe that our future success depends to
a large degree on our ability to develop new optical products and services to enhance the performance characteristics and methods of manufacture
of existing products. Accordingly, we expect to continue to seek and obtain product-related design and development contracts with customers
and to selectively invest our own funds on research and development, particularly in the areas of Microprecision TM
optics,
micro medical cameras, illumination, single-use endoscopes and 3D endoscopes.
Current sales and marketing activities are intended
to broaden awareness of the benefits of our new technology platforms and our successful application of these new technologies to medical
device projects requiring surgery-grade visualization from sub-millimeter sized devices and 3D endoscopy, including single-use products
and assemblies. We market directly to established medical device companies primarily in the United States that we believe could benefit
from our advanced endoscopy visualization systems. Through this direct marketing, referrals, attendance at trade shows and a presence
in online professional association websites, we have expanded our on-going pipeline of projects to significant medical device companies
as well as well-funded emerging technology companies. We expect our customer pipeline to continue to expand as development projects transition
to production orders and new customer projects enter the development phase.
General
This management’s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
There have been no significant changes in our
critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Notes to our Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2022.
Results of Operations
Our total revenues for the quarter ended December
31, 2022, were $5,886,961, as compared to $3,897,041 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $1,989,920, or 51.1%, primarily
due to an increase in component revenue to a large defense contractor, and a $600,000 one-time sale of technology rights relating to a
medical device instrument developed for a customer.
15
Our total revenues for the six months ended December 31,
2022 were $10,972,262, as compared to $6,233,385 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $4,738,877, or 76.0% due in part
to the inclusion of the Lighthouse division since its acquisition on October 4, 2021, increases in component sales in the El Paso and
Gardner locations, an increase in engineering revenues, and one-time technology rights revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
Our two largest customers accounted for 14.2%
and 18.1% of our revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and 15.3% and 11.8% of our revenue during the six months ended December
31, 2022. One of our two largest customers is a defense/aerospace company and the other is developing a medical device instrument. We
generated revenues from 207 unique customers during the six months ended December 31, 2022, and no other customer represented over 10%
of our revenue during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.
The COVID-19 world-wide pandemic that began during
the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and the domestic and international impact of policy decisions being made in major countries around the
world has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our sources of supply, current and future orders from our customers, collection
of amounts owed to us from our customers, our internal operating procedures, and our overall financial condition.
Gross profit for the quarter ended December
31, 2022 was $2,725,224, compared to $1,119,582 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $1,605,642, or 143%. Gross
profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as a percentage of our revenues was 46.3%, an increase from the gross profit
percentage of 28.7% for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $4,449,878,
as compared to $1,758,614 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $2,691,264 or 153%. Gross profit for the six months
ended December 31, 2022 as a percentage of our revenues was 40.6%, an increase from the gross profit percentage of 28.2% for
the same period in the prior year. Quarterly gross profit and gross profit percentage depend on a number of factors, including
overall sales volume, facility utilization, product sales mix, the costs of engineering services, and production start-up costs and
challenges in connection with new products, the effects of COVID-19 pandemic policy decisions on various economies and our suppliers
and customers, as well as the effects on production efficiencies due to the augmented policies we have incorporated into our
operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our gross profit on individual engineering projects
is dependent on a number of factors and is expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the nature and status of engineering
projects, unanticipated cost over-runs, design challenges and changes, start-up production activities, or other customer-imposed project
changes or delays. Our increase in gross profit dollars and margin during three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the
same periods in the previous years was due to inclusion of the Lighthouse division since its acquisition on October 4, 2021, increases
in engineering, component and production revenues, greater production and personnel utilization, and recognition of technology rights
revenue with no associated direct incremental costs.
Research and development expenses were $208,666
for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to $113,164 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $95,502, or 84.4%.
Research and development expenses were $454,143 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $218,350 for the same period
in the prior year, an increase of $235,793, or 108%. In-house research and development and certain internal functions not directly related
to customer engagements are classified as research and development expenses with the majority of our engineering, research and development
activities being consumed in revenue generating engagements with our customers for the development of their products. During the three
and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same periods of the prior year we had an increase in personnel, and an increase
in research and development costs incurred in the development of internal research and development efforts and projects.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were
$1,819,741 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,466,768 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $352,973,
or 24.1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,315,507 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $2,400,392
for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $915,115, or 38.1%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses
in the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year was primarily due to inclusion of the
Lighthouse division since its acquisition in October, 2021, plus increased compensation due to expanded headcount, incentive bonuses and
sales commissions resulting from increased revenues, and marketing related expenses, offset by a decreased amount of stock-based compensation
expense.
16
Liquidity and Capital Resources
With the exception of the current period ended
December 31, 2022, during which net income was 560,909, which includes one-time technology rights revenue of $600,000, we have sustained
recurring net losses from operations for several years. During the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 we incurred operating losses of
$1,513,890 and $905,583, respectively. At December 31, 2022, cash was $381,318, accounts receivables were $4,032,522 and current liabilities
were $5,477,991, including $794,981 of customer advances received for future order deliveries.
Although our revenue and gross margin have increased,
our operating expenses have also increased, and we continue to experience pricing pressure from our customers and challenges in engineering
projects and production orders that can result in cost over-runs and depressed gross margins. We also experience added uncertainty related
to our vendors ability to supply materials and our customers future order levels as a result of the economic impact the COVID-19 world-wide
pandemic and related jurisdictional policies and regulations and lingering supply-chain issues. Consequently, critical to our ability
to maintain our financial condition is achieving and maintaining a level of quarterly revenues that generate break even or better financial
performance as well as timely collection of accounts receivable from our customers. We believe profitable operating results can be achieved
through a combination of revenue levels, realized gross profits and controlling operating expense increases, all of which are subject
to periodic fluctuations resulting from sales mix and the stage of completion of varying engineering service projects as they progress
towards and into production level revenues.
We have traditionally funded working capital needs
through product sales, management of working capital components of our business, cash received from public and private offerings of our
common stock, warrants to purchase shares of our common stock or convertible notes, manufacturing equipment leases, and by customer advances
paid against purchase orders by our customers and recorded in the current liabilities section of the accompanying financial statements.
We have incurred year to year and quarter to quarter operating losses during our efforts to develop current products including Microprecision TM
optical elements, micro medical camera assemblies and 3D endoscopes. Our management believes that the opportunities represented by these
technical capabilities and related products have the potential to generate sales increases to achieve breakeven and profitable results.
In connection with our October 2021 acquisition
of Lighthouse Imaging, we entered into a $2,600,000 bank term loan, and sold shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $1,500,000.
We also secured a $250,000 bank line of credit from the same bank in October 2021 for working capital needs, which was increased to $500,000
in May 2022. There were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit at December 31, 2022.
Capital equipment expenditures and additional
patent costs during the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $37,637. Future capital equipment and patent expenditures will be dependent
upon future sales and success of on-going research and development efforts.
