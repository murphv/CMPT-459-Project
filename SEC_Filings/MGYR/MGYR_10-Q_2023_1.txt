MAGYAR BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
NOTE A – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), its wholly owned subsidiary, Magyar Bank (the “Bank”),
and the Bank’s wholly owned subsidiaries Magyar Service Corporation, Hungaria Urban Renewal, LLC, and Magyar Investment Company.
All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements on
the accrual basis and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP").
The unaudited information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) that are, in the opinion
of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.
Operating results
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending September
30, 2023. The September 30, 2022 information has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does
not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan
losses, the valuation of other real estate owned (“OREO”), and the assessment of realizability of deferred income tax assets.
The Company has evaluated
events and transactions occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date of December 31, 2022 for items that should potentially be recognized
or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was conducted through the date these consolidated financial statements
were issued.
NOTE B- RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In
connection with the preparation of quarterly and annual reports in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”)
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 11.M requires the disclosure of the impact that recently issued accounting
standards will have on
consolidated
financial statements when they are adopted in the future.
In June 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses . ASU 2016-13
requires entities to report “expected” credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit rather
than the current “incurred loss” model. These expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date are to
be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU will also require enhanced disclosures
to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit
losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative
and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.
In October 2019, the
FASB voted to defer the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for smaller reporting companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022
(October 1, 2023 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company currently expects to continue to qualify
as a smaller reporting company, based upon the current SEC definition, and as a result, will be able to defer implementation of the new
standard until October 1, 2023. The Company did not early adopt as of December 31, 2022, but will continue to review factors that might
indicate that the full deferral time period should not be used. The Company continues to evaluate the impact the new standard will have
on the accounting for credit losses, but the Company may recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for loan losses
as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, consistent with regulatory expectations set
forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016. The Company cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative
adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
6
Table of Contents
In January 2020, the
FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,
March 2020 , to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge
accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative
reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements
to contracts affected by what the guidance calls “reference rate reform” if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes
this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. Also,
entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected
by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met, and can make a one-time election to sell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt
securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU were effective for all entities
upon issuance through December 31, 2022 and did not impact the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
In March 2022, the
FASB issued ASU 2022-02,
Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) and Vintage Disclosures
as an update to
Financial
Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326).
The amendments in this ASU eliminate the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and,
instead, require that an entity evaluate (consistent with the accounting for other loan modifications) whether the modification represents
a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The amendments enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements
related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, ASU 2022-02 requires
that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases
within the scope of Subtopic 326-20,
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized Cost . The amendments
in ASU 2022-02 will be effective for the Company with its adoption of ASU 2016-13.
NOTE C - CONTINGENCIES
The Company, from
time to time, is a party to routine litigation that arises in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the resolution
of this litigation, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results
of operations.
NOTE D - EARNINGS
PER SHARE
The following table
presents a calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Basic and diluted
earnings per share were calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the periods.

NOTE E – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND STOCK
REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Company follows FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Section 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which covers a wide range of share-based
compensation arrangements including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee
share purchase plans. ASC 718 requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in consolidated
financial statements. The cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.
ASC 718 also requires the
Company to realize as a financing cash flow rather than an operating cash flow, as previously required, the benefits of realized tax deductions
in excess of previously recognized tax benefits on compensation expense. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
No. 107, the Company classified share-based compensation for employees and outside directors within “compensation and employee
benefits” in the Consolidated Statements of Income to correspond with the same line item as the cash compensation paid.
Stock options generally
vest over a
five -year service period and expire ten
years
from issuance. Management recognizes compensation expense for all option grants
over the awards’ respective requisite service periods. The fair values of all option grants were estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. Management considered historical information on the volatility of the Company’s stock in determining the assumed
volatility rate used in the estimation of fair value. Management estimated the expected life of the options using the simplified method
allowed under SAB No. 107. The
7 -year Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant provided the risk-free rate for periods within
the contractual life of the option. Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded
vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Management estimated a
95 % retention rate for stock
option recipients. Once vested, these awards are irrevocable. Shares will be obtained from either the open market or treasury stock upon
share option exercise.
Restricted shares generally
vest over a five-year service period on the anniversary of the grant date. Once vested, these awards are irrevocable. The product of the
number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted shares
under the Company’s restricted stock plans. Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted shares on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
On August 25, 2022, the
Company adopted the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan which provided for grants of up to
547,400
shares to be allocated between incentive
and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock awards to officers, employees and directors of the Company and Magyar Bank. At December
31, 2022,
293,200
options and
156,400
shares of restricted stock had been awarded from the plan.

Stock option and stock
award expenses included with compensation expense were $ 69,000
and $ 111,000 , respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
There was no stock option or stock award expense for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Company had no other stock-based compensation
plans as of December 31, 2022 except as disclosed below.
On December 8, 2022
the Company announced the completion of its third stock repurchase program, under which
354,891
shares had been repurchased at an average
price of $ 12.90 . The Company also announced the authorization of an additional stock repurchase plan pursuant to which the Company intends
to repurchase up to an additional
5 % of its outstanding shares, or up to
337,146
shares. The timing of the repurchases will depend on
certain factors, including but not limited to, market conditions and prices, the Company’s liquidity requirements and alternative
uses of capital.
The Company has an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") for the benefit of employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. The ESOP trust purchases
shares of common stock in the open market using proceeds of a loan from the Company. The loan is secured by shares of the Company’s
stock. The Bank makes cash contributions to the ESOP on an annual basis sufficient to enable the ESOP to make the required loan payments
to the Company. As the debt is repaid, shares are released as collateral and allocated to qualified employees. Accordingly, the shares
pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance
with FASB ASC Topic 718, “Employer’s Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans.” As shares are released from collateral,
the Company reports compensation expense equal to the current market price of the shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings
per share computations.
In connection with the
Company’s second-step stock offering during its fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, the ESOP trustees purchased
312,800
shares
of the Company’s common stock for $ 3.4
million, reflecting an average cost per share of $ 10.77 . The ESOP loan bears a variable interest
rate that adjusts annually to Prime Rate ( 3.25 % at January 1, 2022, adjusting to
7.50 % on January 1, 2023) with principal and interest
payable annually in equal installments over
thirty years .
At December 31, 2022,
shares allocated to participants totaled
22,487 . Unallocated ESOP shares held in suspense totaled
290,313
at December 31, 2022 and the
aggregate fair value was $ 3.7
million. The Company's contribution expense for the ESOP was $ 41,000
and $ 61,000
for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

NOTE G – FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The Company uses
fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The
securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required
to record at fair value other assets or liabilities on a non-recurring basis, such as held-to-maturity securities, mortgage servicing
rights, loans receivable and OREO. These non-recurring fair value adjustments involve the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting
or write-downs of individual assets.
In accordance with
ASC 820, the Company groups its assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded
and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:
Level 1
-
Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2
-
Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
Level 3
-
Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. The results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability.
The Company based
its fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
The following is
a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
Securities available-for-sale
The securities available-for-sale
portfolio is carried at estimated fair value on a recurring basis, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated
other comprehensive income/loss in stockholders’ equity. The securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of U.S government-sponsored
mortgage-backed securities and private label mortgage-backed securities. The fair values of these securities are obtained from an independent
nationally recognized pricing service. An independent pricing service provides the Company with prices which are categorized as Level
2, as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are generally not available for the securities in the Company’s portfolio.
Various modeling techniques are used to determine pricing for Company’s mortgage-backed securities, including option pricing and
discounted cash flow models. The inputs to these models include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads,
two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data.
Derivatives
Magyar Bank executes
interest rate swaps with commercial lending customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The fair values of such
derivatives are based on valuation models from a third party using current market terms (including interest rates and fees), the remaining
terms of the agreements and the credit worthiness of the counter party as of the measurement date (Level 2).
The following tables
provide the level of valuation assumptions used to determine the carrying value of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on
a recurring basis.

The following is
a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Impaired Loans
Loans which meet certain
criteria are evaluated individually for impairment. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that
the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All amounts due according
to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the
loan agreement. Three impairment measurement methods are used, depending upon the collateral securing the asset: 1) the present value
of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate (the rate of return implicit in the loan); 2) the
asset’s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling and disposition costs, if the
asset is collateral dependent. The regulatory agencies require the last method for loans from which repayment is expected to be provided
solely by the underlying collateral. The Company’s impaired loans are generally collateral dependent and, as such, are carried at
the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Fair value is estimated through current appraisals, and adjusted
by management as necessary, to reflect current market conditions and, as such, are generally classified as Level 3.
Appraisals of collateral
securing impaired loans are conducted by approved, qualified, and independent third-party appraisers. Such appraisals are ordered via
the Company’s credit administration department, independent from the lender who originated the loan, once the loan is deemed impaired,
as described in the previous paragraph. Impaired loans are generally re-evaluated with an updated appraisal within one year of the last
appraisal. The Company discounts the appraised “as is” value of the collateral for estimated selling and disposition costs
and compares the resulting fair value of collateral to the outstanding loan amount. If the outstanding loan amount is greater than the
discounted fair value, the Company requires a reduction in the outstanding loan balance or additional collateral before considering an
extension to the loan. If the borrower is unwilling or unable to reduce the loan balance or increase the collateral securing the loan,
it is deemed impaired and the difference between the loan amount and the fair value of collateral, net of estimated selling and disposition
costs, is charged off through a reduction of the allowance for loan loss.

Other Real Estate Owned
The fair value of
other real estate owned is determined through current appraisals, and adjusted as necessary, by management, to reflect current market
conditions and anticipated selling and disposition costs. As such, other real estate owned is generally classified as Level 3.
The following tables
provide the level of valuation assumptions used to determine the carrying value of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on

The following presents
the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial instruments carried at cost
or amortized cost as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.  For short-term financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents
and accrued interest receivable, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the relatively short time between the
origination of the instrument and its expected realization. For financial liabilities such as interest-bearing demand, NOW, and money
market savings deposits, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to these products being payable on demand and
having no stated maturity.

NOTE H – LEASES
The Company accounts
for its leases in accordance with ASU 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) . Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and
a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement
date.
The Company holds
operating leases for five branch locations. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to
nine years , some of which include options to
extend the leases for up to 10 additional years. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets and lease liabilities and are included within
Other assets and Accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Operating lease ROU
assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to
make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement base on the present
value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate that represents our incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing
rate used by the Company to value its operating leases is based on the interpolated term advance rate available from the Federal Home
Loan Bank of New York, based on the remaining lease term.
At
December
31 , 2022, the Company’s operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities
totaled $ 3.1
million and $ 3.4
million, respectively.

NOTE J – IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES
The Company recognizes
credit-related other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities in earnings while noncredit-related other-than-temporary impairment
on debt securities not expected to be sold are recognized in other comprehensive income.
The Company reviews
its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment. This review includes analyzing the length of time and the
extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including
any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market. The Company evaluates its intent and ability to hold debt securities
based upon its investment strategy for the particular type of security and its cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and
interest rate risk position. In addition, the risk of future other-than-temporary impairment may be influenced by prolonged recession
in the U.S. economy, changes in real estate values and interest deferrals.

The investment securities
listed above currently have fair values less than amortized cost and therefore contain unrealized losses. The Company evaluated these
securities and determined that the decline in value was primarily related to fluctuations in the interest rate environment and were not
related to any company or industry specific event.
The Company anticipates
full recovery of amortized costs with respect to these securities. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and has determined
that it is not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these securities prior to maturity or market price recovery.
Management has considered factors regarding other than temporarily impaired securities and determined that there are no securities with
impairment that is other than temporary as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.

The segments of
the Bank’s loan portfolio are disaggregated to a level that allows management to monitor risk and performance. The residential mortgage
loan segment is further disaggregated into two classes: first lien, amortizing term loans, and the combination of second lien amortizing
term loans and home equity lines of credit. The commercial loan segment is further disaggregated into three classes: loans secured by
multifamily structures, loans secured by owner-occupied commercial structures, and loans secured by non-owner occupied nonresidential
properties. The construction loan segment consists primarily of developers or investors for the purpose of acquiring, developing and constructing
residential or commercial structures and to a lesser extent one-to-four family residential construction loans made to individuals for
the acquisition of and/or construction on a lot or lots on which a residential dwelling is to be built. Construction loans to developers
and investors have a higher risk profile because the ultimate buyer, once development is completed, is generally not known at the time
of the loan. The commercial business loan segment consists of loans made for the purpose of financing the activities of commercial customers
and consists primarily of revolving lines of credit. The consumer loan segment consists primarily of stock-secured installment loans,
but also includes unsecured personal loans and overdraft lines of credit connected with customer deposit accounts.
Management evaluates
individual loans in all segments for possible impairment if the loan either is in nonaccrual status, or is risk rated Substandard and
is 90 days or more past due.  Loans are considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable
that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms
of the loan agreement.  Factors considered by management in evaluating impairment include payment status, collateral value,
and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.  Management determines the significance
of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan
and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount
of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.
Once the determination
has been made that a loan is impaired, the recorded investment in the loan is compared to the fair value of the loan using one of three
methods: (a) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate; (b) the loan’s
current observable market price; or (c) the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, less anticipated selling and disposition costs.
The method is selected on a loan-by loan basis, with management primarily utilizing the fair value of collateral method. If there is a
shortfall between the fair value of the loan and the recorded investment in the loan, the Company charges the difference to the allowance
for loan loss as a charge-off and carries the impaired loan on its books at fair value. It is the Company’s policy to evaluate impaired
loans on an annual basis to ensure the recorded investment in a loan does not exceed its fair value.

The average recorded
investment in impaired loans was $ 5.8
million and $ 10.8
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The
Company’s impaired loans include delinquent non-accrual loans and performing Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”),
as TDRs remain impaired loans until fully repaid. There was one TDR loan totaling $ 97,000
during the three months December 31, 2022 and
there were
no
TDRs during the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Management uses
a ten point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first six categories are considered
not criticized, and are aggregated as “Pass” rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow
bank regulatory definitions. The Special Mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting
in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a Substandard classification. Loans in the Substandard
category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will
be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected.  Loans classified Doubtful have all the weaknesses
inherent in loans classified Substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current
conditions and facts, is highly improbable.
All loans greater than three months past due are considered Substandard. Any portion
of a loan that has been charged off is placed in the Loss category.
To help ensure that
risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Bank has a structured
loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight.  Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans
are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as severe delinquency, bankruptcy, repossession, or death occurs to
raise awareness of a possible credit event. The Bank’s Commercial Loan Officers are responsible for the timely and accurate
risk rating of the loans in their portfolios at origination and on an ongoing basis. The Bank’s Asset Review Committee performs
monthly reviews of all commercial relationships internally rated 6 (“Watch”) or worse.  Confirmation of the appropriate
risk grade is performed by an external loan review company that semi-annually reviews and assesses loans within the portfolio.   Generally,
the external consultant reviews commercial relationships greater than $500,000 and/or criticized relationships greater than $250,000.  Detailed
reviews, including plans for resolution, are performed on loans classified as Substandard on a monthly basis.

An allowance for
loan losses (“ALL”) is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio.  The ALL is based on management’s
continuing evaluation of the risk characteristics and credit quality of the loan portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions,
diversification and size of the portfolio, adequacy of collateral, past and anticipated loss experience, and the amount of non-performing
loans.
The Bank’s
methodology for determining the ALL is based on the requirements of ASC Section 310-10-35 for loans individually evaluated for impairment
(discussed above) and ASC Subtopic 450-20 for loans collectively evaluated for impairment, as well as the Interagency Policy Statements
on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and other bank regulatory guidance.
20
Table of Contents
Loans that are collectively
evaluated for impairment are analyzed with general allowances being made as appropriate. For general allowances, historical loss
trends are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio. These historical loss amounts are modified by other qualitative
and economic factors.
The loans are segmented
into classes based on their inherent varying degrees of risk, as described above. Management tracks the historical net charge-off
activity by segment and utilizes this figure, as a percentage of the segment, as the general reserve percentage for pooled, homogenous
loans that have not been deemed impaired. Typically, an average of losses incurred over five historical years is used.
Non-impaired credits
are segregated for the application of qualitative factors. Management has identified a number of additional qualitative factors which
it uses to supplement the historical charge-off factor because these factors are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with
the existing loan pools to differ from historical loss experience. The additional factors that are evaluated quarterly and updated
using information obtained from internal, regulatory, and governmental sources include: national and local economic trends and conditions;
levels of and trends in delinquency rates and non-accrual loans; trends in volumes and terms of loans; effects of changes in lending policies;
experience, ability, and depth of lending staff; value of underlying collateral; and concentrations of credit from a loan type, industry
and/or geographic standpoint.
Management reviews
the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis using a defined, consistently applied process in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments
to the ALL. When information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against
the ALL. Since loans individually evaluated for impairment are promptly written down to their fair value, typically there is no portion
of the ALL for loans individually evaluated for impairment.

The allowance for
loan losses is based on estimates, and actual losses will vary from current estimates. Management believes that the segmentation
of the loan portfolio into homogeneous pools and the related historical loss ratios and other qualitative factors, as well as the consistency
in the application of assumptions, result in an ALL that is representative of the risk found in the components of the portfolio at any
given date.
A
TDR is a loan
that has been modified whereby the Bank has agreed to make certain concessions to
a borrower to meet the needs of both the borrower and the Bank to maximize the ultimate recovery of a loan. TDR occurs when a borrower
is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties and the loan is modified using a modification that would otherwise
not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted generally include, but are not limited to, interest rate reductions,
limitations on the accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferment of principal.
A default on a TDR loan
for purposes of this disclosure occurs when a borrower is 90 days past due or a foreclosure or repossession of the applicable collateral
has occurred. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 there was one TDR loan totaling $ 387,000
that became delinquent greater
than 90 days. The loan is secured by commercial real estate and was in the process of foreclosure at December 31, 2022.
There was one TDR loan
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and no TDRs during the three months ended December 31, 2021.

NOTE M –
INCOME TAXES
The Company records
income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities: (i) are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns; (ii) are attributable
to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases; and (iii) are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.
Where applicable, deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portions determined not likely to be realized. The valuation allowance is assessed
by management on a quarterly basis and adjusted, by a charge or credit to income tax expense, as changes in facts and circumstances warrant.
In assessing whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, management considers
projections of future taxable income, the projected periods in which current temporary differences will be deductible, the availability
of carry forwards, feasible and permissible tax planning strategies and existing tax laws and regulations. The Company did not have a
valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022.
A reconciliation
of income tax between the amounts calculated based upon pre-tax income at the Company’s federal statutory rate and the amounts reflected
in the consolidated statements of operations are as follows:

The Company’s
statutory income tax rate in the State of New Jersey was
9.0 % for the
three
months ending December 31, 2022 and 2021. The State of New
Jersey has imposed a temporary surtax on corporations earning New Jersey allocated income in excess of $ 1
million. The surtax is set at
a rate of
2.5 % and is currently effective through December 31, 2023. Accordingly, the Company used an
11.5 % State tax rate for the calculation
of its State income tax expense for the
three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

NOTE N - FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK
The Company may use
derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and interest rate floors and caps, as part of its interest rate risk management. Interest
rate caps and floors are agreements whereby one party agrees to pay or receive a floating rate of interest on a notional principal amount
for a predetermined period of time if certain market interest rate thresholds are met. The Company considers the credit risk inherent
in these contracts to be negligible. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not hold any interest rate floors or collars.
The Company is a party
to interest rate derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. Under a program, the Company executes interest rate swaps
with commercial lending customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. These interest rate swaps with customers
are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third-party financial institution, such that the Company
minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. Because the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not
meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized
directly in earnings. The changes in the fair value of the swaps offset each other, except for the credit risk of the counterparties,
which is determined by taking into consideration the risk rating, probability of default and loss given default for all counterparties.
The Company was not required to pledge any collateral for its interest rate swaps with financial institutions at December 31, 2022 and
September 30, 2022.

Item 2. Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward-Looking
Statements
When used in this filing and in
future filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the Company’s press releases or other public or shareholder
communications, or in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases, “anticipate,”
“would be,” “will allow,” “intends to,” “will likely result,” “are expected to,”
“will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated,” “projected,” “believes”, or
similar expressions are intended to identify “forward looking statements.” Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those risks previously disclosed by the Company in Item 1A of its Annual Report
on Form 10-K as may be supplemented by Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, general economic conditions, changes in interest
rates, regulatory considerations, competition, technological developments, retention and recruitment of qualified personnel, and market
acceptance of the Company’s pricing, products and services, and with respect to the loans extended by the Company and real estate
owned, the following: risks related to the economic environment in the market areas in which the Bank operates, particularly with respect
to the real estate market in New Jersey; the risk that the value of the real estate securing these loans may decline in value; and the
risk that significant expense may be incurred by the Company in connection with the resolution of these loans.
The Company wishes to caution
readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and advises readers
that various factors, including regional and national economic conditions, substantial changes in levels of market interest rates, credit
and other risks of lending and investing activities, and competitive and regulatory factors, could affect the Company’s financial
performance and could cause the Company’s actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.
The Company does not undertake,
and specifically disclaims any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or
circumstances after the date of such statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies
are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different
results under different assumptions and conditions. Critical accounting policies may involve complex subjective decisions or assessments.
We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies.
Allowance for Loan
Loss.
The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover credit losses in the loan portfolio
both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which
is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this
policy as one of our most critical. Due to the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the
potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses,
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management.
As a substantial amount
of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash
flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisals
and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative
changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The
assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the
resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans.
25
Table of Contents
Management performs a quarterly
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. We consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including,
but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying
collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently
subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic
and real estate market conditions.
The evaluation has a specific
and general component. The specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as impaired through the application
of our loan review process and our loan grading system. All such loans are evaluated individually, with principal consideration given
to the value of the collateral securing the loan and discounted cash flows. Specific impairment allowances are established as required
by this analysis. However, the Bank’s Federal and State regulators generally require that the specific reserve against impaired
collateral-dependent loans be charged-off, reducing the carrying balance of the loan and allowance for loan loss. The general component
is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We analyze historical
loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations in establishing the general
portion of the reserve. This analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component
of the allowance for loan losses.
Actual loan losses may be significantly
greater than the allowances we have established, which could have a material negative effect on our financial results.
We intend to adopt the Current
Expected Credit Losses (CECL) Methodology effective October 1, 2023. The adoption of the CECL standard for determining the amount of our
allowance for credit losses may increase our allowance for loan and lease losses upon adoption and cause our historic allowance for loan
and lease losses not to be indicative of how we will maintain our allowance for credit losses beginning October 1, 2023.
Deferred Income Taxes.
The
Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities: (i) are recognized
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns;
(ii) are attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases; and (iii) are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Deferred tax assets are likely
to be realized and therefore do not have a valuation allowance.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31,
2022 and September 30, 2022
Total Assets.
Total
assets increased $23.1 million, or 2.9%, to $821.6 million at December 31, 2022 compared with $798.5 million at September 30, 2022. The
increase was attributable to higher balances of loans receivable, net of allowance for loan loss, partially offset by lower interest-earning
deposits with banks.
Cash and interest-earning deposits
with banks decreased $23.1 million, or 74.5% to $7.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $30.9 million at September 30, 2022 resulting primarily
from deployment of these funds into loans receivable during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Loans Receivable.
Total
loans receivable increased $46.8 million, or 7.4%, to $675.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $628.9 million for the year ended September
30, 2022. Growth occurred in commercial real estate loans, which increased $46.5 million, or 13.6%, to $389.2 million, in construction
loans, which increased $2.6 million, or 17.4%, to $17.9 million, in one-to four-family residential mortgage loans (including home equity
lines of credit), which increased $653,000, or 0.3%, to $233.7 million and in other consumer loans, which increased $130,000, or 4.2%,
to $3.3 million. Offsetting these increases was a $3.0 million, or 8.8%, decrease in commercial business loans to $31.6 million.
Total loans receivable at December
31, 2022 were comprised of $389.2 million (57.6%) in commercial real estate loans, $215.3 million (31.9%) in one-to four-family residential
mortgage loans, $31.6 million (4.7%) in commercial business loans, $17.9 million (2.6%) in construction loans, $18.5 million (2.7%) in
home equity lines of credit, and $3.2 million (0.5%) in other loans. For comparison, total loans receivable at September 30, 2022 were
comprised of $342.8 million (54.5%) in commercial real estate loans, $214.4 million (34.1%) in one- to four- family residential mortgage
loans, $34.7 million (5.5%) in commercial business loans, $15.2 million (2.4%) in construction loans, and $21.8 million (3.5%) in home
equity lines of credit and other loans.

Table of Contents
Total non-performing loans increased
$1.1 million, or 37.5%, to $3.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $2.8 million at September 30, 2022. The addition of one consumer loan
secured by shares of Johnson & Johnson stock totaling $676,000 and one commercial real estate loan totaling $387,000 accounted for
the increase in non-performing loans during the quarter. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans increased to 0.58% at December
31, 2022 from 0.45% at September 30, 2022.
The allowance for loan losses
increased $317,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 to $8.8 million. The $46.8 million increase in loans receivable as
well as the increase in non-performing loans accounted for the increase in the Company’s allowance for loan loss.
The allowance for loan losses
as a percentage of non-performing loans decreased to 224.4% at December 31, 2022 from 297.5% at September 30, 2022. Our allowance for
loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.29% at December 31, 2022 compared with 1.34% at September 30, 2022. Future increases
in the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on possible future increases in non-performing loans and charge-offs, the possible
deterioration of collateral values, and the possible deterioration of the current economic environment.
Investment Securities.
At December 31, 2022, investment securities totaled $99.8 million, reflecting a decrease of $1.0 million, or 1.0% from $100.9 million
at September 30, 2022.
The Company did not purchase or
sell any new investment securities during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company received payments from mortgage-backed
securities totaling $1.2 million during the quarter that were used to fund new loan originations. Investment securities at December 31,
2022 consisted of $63.3 million in mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises,
$24.8 million in U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities, $8.0 million in corporate notes, $3.5 million in municipal bonds,
and $220,000 in private-label mortgage-backed securities. There were no other-than-temporary-impairment charges for the Company’s
investment securities for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance.
The Company’s carrying value of its life insurance policies held for directors and officers of Magyar Bank increased $95,000, or
0.5%, to $17.8 million at December 31, 2022 from $17.7 million at September 30, 2022. The increase was attributable to an increase in
the cash surrender value of the policies during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Other Real Estate Owned.
OREO increased $11,000, or 3.9%, to $292,000 at December 31, 2022 from capital improvements to one property in order to market
it for sale. The property was under contract for sale at December 31, 2022.
Deposits.
Total
deposits increased $8.4 million, or 1.3%, to $676.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $667.7 million at September 30, 2022.
The increase in deposits during
the three months ended December 31, 2022 occurred in money market accounts, which increased $11.5 million, or 5.2%, to $233.7 million,
in non-interest bearing checking accounts, which increased $6.0 million, or 3.3%, to $188.4 million, and in certificates of deposit (including
individual retirement accounts), which increased $1.8 million, or 2.2%, to $84.4 million. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases
in savings accounts, which decreased $5.7 million, or 7.0%, to $76.1 million and in interest-bearing checking accounts (NOW), which decreased
$5.2 million, or 5.3%, to $93.5 million. Included in the certificates of deposit were $11.4 million in brokered certificates of deposit.
Borrowed Funds.
Borrowings
increased $14.1 million, or 90.2%, to $29.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $15.6 million at September 30, 2022.
The Company borrowed $11.1 million
in overnight advances and $3.0 million in term advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York during the quarter to fund its loan
originations.
Stockholders’ Equity.
Stockholders’ equity increased $1.4 million, or 1.4%, to $99.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $98.5 million at September
30, 2022. The increase was due to net income of $1.8 million during the quarter, partially offset by $744,000 in dividends paid and 2,194
shares repurchased during the quarter at an average share price of $12.54. The Company’s book value per share increased to $14.82
at December 31, 2022 from $14.60 at September 30, 2022, and 6,742,934 shares were outstanding at December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months
Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Net Income . Net
income increased $117,000, or 6.9% to $1.8 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 compared with net income of $1.7
million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to higher net interest and lower other expenses, partially
offset by higher provision for loan loss and lower other income.
Net Interest and Dividend
Income.
Net interest and dividend income increased $453,000, or 7.0%, to $6.9 million for the three months ended December 31,
2022 from $6.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to a 14 basis point increase in the
Company’s net interest margin to 3.60% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 3.46% for the three months ended December
31, 2021.
Interest and Dividend Income.
Interest and dividend income increased $1.5 million, or 21.3%, to $8.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared
with $7.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to a 68 basis point increase in the yield
on interest-earning assets to 4.44% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 3.76% for the three months ended December 31, 2021
as well as a $21.3 million, or 2.9%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. There were no Paycheck Protection Program
loan fees included in interest income on loans receivable for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $407,000 for the
three months ended December 31, 2021.
The average balance of loans receivable,
net of allowance for loan loss, increased $64.1 million to $643.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $579.1
million during the three months ended December 31, 2021 while the yield on loans receivable increased 31 basis points to 4.91% for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 from 4.60% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to higher market interest rates. The
higher average balance and yield accounted for a $1.2 million, or 18.4%, increase in loan interest income between periods.
Interest
earned on investment securities, including interest-earning deposits and excluding FHLB stock, increased $250,000, or 93.3%, to $518,000
for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $268,000 for the prior year quarter. A 111 basis point increase in the yield on such assets
to 1.79% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 0.69% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a $42.7
million, or 27.0%, decrease in the average balance of investment securities and interest-earning deposits to $115.5 million for the quarter
ended December 31, 2022, accounted for the increase.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense increased $1.0 million, or 182.5%, to $1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $570,000 for the
three months ended December 31, 2021. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 80 basis points to 1.27% for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 compared with 0.47% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 resulting primarily from higher market interest
rates. Between periods, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $20.2 million, or 4.2%, to $502.2 million.
The average balance of interest-bearing
deposits increased $23.0 million, or 5.0%, to $483.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $460.0 million for the quarter
ended December 31, 2021, while the average cost of such deposits increased 82 basis points to 1.21% from 0.39%. As a result, interest
paid on interest-bearing deposits increased $1.0 million to $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared with $451,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to higher market interest rate environment.
Interest paid on borrowings increased
$17,000, or 14.3%, to $136,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $119,000 for the prior year period. The increase was
the result of a 67 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings to 2.83% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 2.16% for
the three months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in the average balance of such borrowings to $19.1
million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $21.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
Provision for Loan Losses.
We establish provisions for loan losses, which are charged to earnings, at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that
are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance
for loan losses, management considers historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse
situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, peer group information
and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant
revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur.
29
Table of Contents
After an evaluation of these factors,
management recorded a provision of $317,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $101,000 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021. The higher provision for loan losses resulted from growth in the Company’s loan portfolio and an increase in
non-performing loans during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company did not record any loan charge-offs or recoveries for
the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared with $52,000 in net recoveries during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Determining the amount of the
allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Management reviews the level of the allowance on a quarterly
basis, and establishes the provision for loan losses based on the factors set forth in the preceding paragraph. As management evaluates
the allowance for loan losses, the increased risk associated with larger non-homogenous construction, commercial real estate and commercial
business loans may result in larger additions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods.
Other Income.
Other
income decreased $52,000, or 8.0%, to $598,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $650,000 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021.
Gains from the sale of Small Business
Administration 7(a) loans decreased $101,000 to $180,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $281,000 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021. Partially offsetting this decrease were $57,000 in interest rate swap fees received during the three months ended
December 31, 2022, compared with no fees during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Other Expenses.
Other
expenses decreased $38,000, or 0.8%, to $4.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
The decrease was primarily attributable
to decreases in professional fees, which decreased $208,000, or 53.7%, to $179,000, due to lower legal and consulting fees related to
the collection and foreclosure of non-performing loans, and OREO expenses, which decreased $18,000 to $16,000, from fewer OREO properties
between periods. Offsetting the decrease was higher compensation and benefit expense, which increased $121,000, or 4.5%, to $2.8 million,
due to stock award and stock option expenses related to the Company’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan.
Income Tax Expense.
The Company recorded tax expense of $780,000 on pre-tax income of $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared
to $674,000 on pre-tax income of $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s effective tax rate for
the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 30.1% compared with 28.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
The Company’s liquidity
is a measure of its ability to fund loans, pay withdrawals of deposits, and other cash outflows in an efficient, cost-effective manner. The
Company’s short-term sources of liquidity include maturity, repayment and sales of assets, excess cash and cash equivalents, new
deposits, other borrowings, and new advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. There has been no material adverse change during the three
months ended December 31, 2022 in the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to fund their operations.
At December 31, 2022, the Company
