NOTES TO CONDENSED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER
31, 2022
NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Nature of Business
Vector 21 Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
(“Vector 21”, “the Company”, “We", "Us" or “Our’) is a publicly quoted
shell company seeking to merge with an entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of
our common stock to create values for our shareholders. No potential merger candidate has been identified at this time.
History
Vector 21 was incorporated in Delaware on March
5, 2021.
Effective April 28, 2021, following a corporate
reorganization as described below (‘the Holding Company Reorganization” or ‘the reverse recapitalization”),
Vector 21 became the reorganized successor to Momentum Biofuels, Inc. (“Predecessor Company”), a publicly quoted holding
company that ceased trading in 2012.
Reorganization into a Holding Company Structure
for Vector 21 Holdings, Inc., reorganization successor to Momentum Biofuels, Inc.
Effective March 10, 2021, Momentum Biofuels,
Inc. (“Momentum Biofuels Colorado”), a Colorado corporation, redomiciled to Delaware by merging with its wholly owned
subsidiary, Momentum Biofuels, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
Momentum Biofuels Colorado ceased to exist
as an independent legal entity following its merger with Momentum Biofuels Delaware.
Pursuant to the Delaware Holding Company formation
statute, DGCL Section 251(g), Momentum Biofuels Delaware entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization into a
Holding Company with Vector 21 Holdings, Inc. (“Vector 21”) and MBF Ops, Inc. (“MBF Ops.”), both wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Momentum Biofuels Delaware, effective April 28, 2021.
The Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
into a Holding Company provided for the merger of Momentum Biofuels Delaware with, and into MBF Ops., with MBF Ops. being the surviving
corporation in the merger, as a subsidiary to Vector 21.
Momentum Biofuels Delaware ceased to exist
as an independent legal entity following its merger with MBF Ops.
The shareholders of Momentum Biofuels Delaware
were converted, by the holding company reorganization, under the Agreement, to shareholders of Vector 21 on a one for one basis
pursuant to the Agreement and the Delaware Statute Sec. 251(g).
MBF Ops., the surviving company of the merger
with Momentum Biofuels Delaware, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vector 21, the holding company.
Vector 21 became the parent holding company
resulting under the Agreement, pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law section 251(g), with its wholly owned subsidiary company,
MBF Ops, the surviving company of the merger with Momentum Biofuels Delaware.

Table of Contents
As a result of the Holding Company Reorganization,
shareholders in the publicly quoted Momentum Biofuels Delaware, formerly the shareholders of Momentum Biofuels Colorado as
of the date of the reorganization, became shareholders in the publicly quoted Vector 21.
MBF Ops, being the direct successor by the
merger with Momentum Biofuels Delaware, became a subsidiary company of Vector 21.
Disposal of MBF Ops.
Effective June 28, 2021, Vector 21 disposed
of
100 % of the issued share capital of its sole subsidiary company, MBF Ops., to an unrelated third party. We made a $ 1,000
payment
in cash to the buyer and promised to issue
50,000
(post-split) shares of our common stock to MBF Ops, Inc. as an incentive for
him to assume ownership of the subsidiary company which had no ongoing business or assets and outstanding liabilities of $ 1,131,102 .
These shares of common were issued to MBF Ops, Inc. effective August 18, 2021.
The Holding Company Reorganization has been accounted for so as to reflect the fact that both Momentum Biofuels Delaware and Vector
21 were under common control at the date of the Holding Company Reorganization.
Reverse and Forward Stock Splits
Effective May 13, 2021, we completed:
-
a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock, $0.0001 par value, on a one (1) post-split share for eight thousand (8,000) pre-split shares basis, and subsequently
-
a forward stock split of our post reverse split outstanding common stock, $0.0001 par value, on a one hundred (100) post-split shares for one (1) pre-split share basis.
As a result of the 8,000 : 1 reverse stock
split described above, the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock was reduced from 123,224,444
to 15,403. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, a holder of record of common stock
who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share was, in lieu thereof, entitled to receive a whole share of common stock.
Consequently 1,069 additional shares were issued in respect of fractional shares and therefore a total of 16,472 shares of common
stock were issued and outstanding after the reverse split.
As a result of the 1 : 100 forward stock split
described above, the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock was increased from 16,472 to 1,647,200.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
We have not commenced
operations as yet and consequently have not been directly impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak at this time. However, the detrimental
effect of the Covid-19 outbreak on the economy as a whole may have a detrimental impact on our ability to raise funding and identify
an entity to merge with for the foreseeable future. We are unable to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact Covid-19 outbreak
on our plans at this time.
Impact of the Ukrainian Conflict
We have not commenced
operations as yet and consequently have not been directly impacted by the Ukrainian conflict at this time currently, we do not
believe that the conflict between Ukraine and Russia will have any direct impact on our operations, financial condition or financial
reporting.  We believe the conflict will have only a general impact on our operations in the same manner as it is having a
general impact on all business operations resulting from international sanction and embargo regulations, possible shortages of
goods and goods incorporating parts that may be supplied from the Ukraine or Russia, supply chain challenges, and the international
and domestic inflationary results of the conflict and government spending for and funding of their response. We do not believe
we will be
6
Table of Contents
targeted for cyber-attacks.
We have no operations in the countries directly involved in the conflict or that are specifically impacted by any of the sanctions
and embargoes, we do not believe that the conflict will have any impact on our internal control over financial reporting.
Other than general securities market trends, we do not have reason to believe that investors will evaluate the company as having
special risks or exposures related to the Ukrainian conflict.
Inflation
We anticipate that our business and financial
position will be impacted by the current inflationary environment. To the extent that we use borrowed funds, we believe costs will
increase for us. Access to capital will be impacted by increased interest rates and may affect our ability to obtain capital. Inflation
will also have an impact on the cost of supplies of goods and services that we use with the consequence of an adverse impact on
our operating costs.
NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN
Our financial statements are prepared using
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) applicable to a going concern, which
contemplate the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have no ongoing business
or income and for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 we incurred a loss of $ 17,058
and had an accumulated deficit of
$ 17,747,757
as of December 31, 2022. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt or equity funding to meet our ongoing operating
expenses and ultimately in merging with another entity with experienced management and profitable operations. No assurances can
be given that we will be successful in achieving these objectives.
NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The summary of significant accounting policies
is presented to assist in the understanding of the financial statements. These policies conform to GAAP and have been consistently
applied. The Company has selected June 30 as its financial year end.
Interim Financial Statements
The accompanying unaudited interim condensed
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information in accordance with Article 8
of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial
statements. The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position,
results of operations, changes in shareholders’ deficit and cash flows as of December 31, 2022 and for the related periods
presented, have been included. The results for the three- and six-months period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative
of the results of operations for the full year. These financial statements and related footnotes should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and footnotes thereto for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 included in our Form 10-12G/A filed
on February 13, 2022.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Table of Contents
Cash and Cash Equivalents :
We maintain cash balances in a non-interest-bearing
account that currently does not exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30,
2022, our cash balances were $ 525
and $ 0 , respectively.
Fair Value Measurements:
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures ("ASC 820"), provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are
required about fair value measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy
prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:
Level 1 – Quoted
prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities
included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Level 2 – Pricing
inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.
The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced
with models using highly observable inputs.
Level 3 – Significant
inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those
with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to
determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.
Our financial instruments consist of our prepaid
expenses, accounts payable and accruals, loan payable – related party and promissory notes – related parties. The carrying
amount of our prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accruals, loan payable – related party and promissory notes –
related parties approximates their fair values because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Related Party Transactions:
A related party is generally defined as (i)
any person that holds
10 % or more of our membership interests including such person's immediate families, (ii) our management,
(iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, or (iv) anyone who can
significantly influence our financial and operating decisions. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when
there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. See Notes 6 and 7 below for details of related party transactions
in the period presented.
Leases:
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at
inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) as assets, operating lease non-current
liabilities, and operating lease current liabilities in our balance sheet. Finance leases are property and equipment, other current
liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in the balance sheet.
ROU assets represent the right to use an asset
for the lease term and lease liability represent the obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU
assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over lease term. As
most of the leases doesn’t provide an implicit rate. We generally use the incremental borrowing rate on the estimated rate
of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating ROU asset
also includes any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payment is recognized on a straight-line
basis over lease term.
8
Table of Contents
The Company was not party to any lease transaction
during the three and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Income Taxes:
The provision for income taxes is computed
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating
losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that
apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
Uncertain Tax Positions:
We evaluate tax positions in a two-step process.
We first determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical
merits of the position. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is then measured to determine
the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that
is greater than
50 % likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We classify gross interest and penalties and unrecognized
tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as long-term liabilities in the financial
statements.
Revenue Recognition:
Revenues are recognized when control of the
promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects
to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate
amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance
obligations
Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies
a performance obligation
As the Company had no business operations during
the three and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have not identified specific planned revenue streams.
During the three and six-month periods ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not recognize any revenue.
Advertising Costs:
We expense advertising costs when advertisements
occur. No advertising costs were incurred during the three and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Stock-Based Compensation:
The cost of equity instruments issued to employees
and non-employees in return for goods and services is measured by the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued in
accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. The related expense is recognized as services are rendered or
vesting periods elapse.

Table of Contents
Net Loss per Share Calculation:
Basic earnings (loss) per common share ("EPS")
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average shares outstanding,
assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their
effect is anti-dilutive.
Recently Accounting Pronouncements:
We have reviewed all the recently issued, but
not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on our
financial statements.
NOTE 4. PREPAID EXPENSES
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022,
the balance of prepaid expenses totaled $ 2,750
and $ 5,958 , respectively, which related to the annual disclosure and news service
subscription for OTC Markets which will be amortized monthly over the course of the year commencing July 1, 2022.
NOTE 5. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUALS
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022,
the balance of accounts payable and accrued expenses was $ 22,918
and $ 22,404 , respectively, which related to the balance due to
our share transfer agent.
NOTE 6. LOAN PAYABLE – RELATED
PARTY
As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022,
the balance outstanding under the loan was $ 6,762
and $ 41,011 , respectively.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
one of our directors, who is also our principal shareholder, advanced to us $ 4,861
by way of a loan to finance our working capital
requirements.
The loan is unsecured, interest free and due
on demand.
As further discussed in
Note 7. Promissory
Notes – Related Parties
below, in December 2022, $ 41,110

Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements that may be affected by matters outside our control that could cause materially different results.
Some of the information in this Form
10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. These statements
express, or are based on, our expectations about future events. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts
of future events. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as, "may",
"will", "expect", "intend", "project", "estimate", "anticipate", "believe"
or "continue" or the negative thereof or similar terminology. They include statements regarding our:
●
financial position,
●
business plans,
●
the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
●
budgets,
●
amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures,
●
cash flow and anticipated liquidity,
●
future operations of unknown nature costs,
●
acquisition and development of other technology,
●
future demand for any products and services acquired,
●
operating costs and other expenses.
Although we believe the expectations
and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove
to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include:
●
general economic conditions,
●
the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
●
our cost of operations,
●
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate,
●
availability of capital,
●
the strength and financial resources of our competitors,
●
our ability to find and retain skilled personnel, and
●
the lack of liquidity of our common stock.
Any of the factors listed above and other
factors contained in this Form 10-Q could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any
other forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We cannot assure you that our future results will meet our expectations.
When you consider these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risk factors and the other cautionary statements
in this Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.
General
Business Plan
Our business
plan to seek a merger has many uncertainties which pose risks to investors.
We intend
to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons
or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).
We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and we may participate in business
ventures of virtually any nature. This discussion of our proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive
of our unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to
participate in only one potential
12
Table of Contents
business
venture because of our lack of financial resources. We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced
operations, or that desire to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products
or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. All of these activities have risk to investors
including dilution and management.
We expect
that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances
being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits
of an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act. Such benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional
equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing
liquidity (subject to restrictions of applicable statutes) for all stockholders and other factors. Potentially, available business
opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We have, and will continue to have,
essentially no assets to provide the owners of business opportunities. However, we will be able to offer owners of acquisition
candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest in an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act without
incurring the cost and time required to conduct an initial public offering.
The analysis
of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, our Board of Directors. We intend to concentrate
on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to our attention through present associations
of our director, professional advisors or by our stockholders. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, we will consider
such matters as (i) available technical, financial and managerial resources; (ii) working capital and other financial requirements;
(iii) history of operations, if any, and prospects for the future; (iv) nature of present and expected competition; (v) quality,
experience and depth of management services; (vi) potential for further research, development or exploration; (vii) specific risk
factors not now foreseeable but that may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company; (viii) potential for
growth or expansion; (ix) potential for profit; (x) public recognition and acceptance of products, services or trades; (xi) name
identification; and (xii) other factors that we consider relevant. As part of our investigation of the business opportunity, we
expect to meet personally with management and key personnel. To the extent possible, we intend to utilize written reports and personal
investigation to evaluate the above factors.
We will
not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time
after closing of the proposed transaction, as required by SEC Rules and Regulations.
Acquisition Interest
In implementing
a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture,
or licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation
of a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition,
our directors may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote
of our stockholders, or sell their stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United
States and any applicable state.
It is
anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration
under application federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may
agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter.
If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition
and is no longer considered an inactive company.
The issuance
of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have
a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop.
While
the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it
desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called “tax-free”
reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In order to obtain tax-free
treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80%
13
Table of Contents
or more
of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our stockholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding
shares of the surviving entity. This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders.
With
respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities,
our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or
acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets
and expectations of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of
shares held by our stockholders.
We will
participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although
the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations
and warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions
which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including
costs associated with the Company’s attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous
other terms.
As stated
above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable
period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or
within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial
statements provided do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents
will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is
voided, the definitive closing documents will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with
the proposed transaction.
Competition
We believe
we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established
venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise
than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant
competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
Investment
Company Act 1940
Although
we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject
to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business
of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment
interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to
register as an investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination
from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material
adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act.
Intellectual
Property
We have
not and do not own any intellectual property.
Employees
We presently
have no full-time executive, operational or clerical staff.
We operate
with three directors and two officers who provide their services to us on a part time basis:
14
Table of Contents
Calvin
D. Smiley, Sr. is our Chief Executive Officer, President, Acting Chief Financial Officer and a director;
Michael
A. Littman is our Secretary and director; and
Redgie
Green is a director.
Revenue
We have
not recorded any revenues from the period from March 5, 2021 (Inception) to December 31 2022, nor for the period from December
31, 2022 through the date of this filing.
Factors Effecting Future
Performance
Our goal
is to obtain debt and/or equity finance to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt to merge with another entity with experienced
management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders.
Although
there is no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed, we believe we can successfully complete an acquisition
or merger which will enable us to continue as a going concern.
Any acquisition
or merger will most likely be dilutive to our existing stockholders.
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
Our
plan of operations is to raise debt and/or equity to meet our ongoing operating expenses and seek to merge  with
another entity with experienced management and  opportunities for growth in return
for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete
this series of transactions. In particular, there is no assurance that any stockholder will realize any return on their shares
after such a transaction. Any merger or acquisition completed by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the
percentage of shares held by our current stockholders.

CASH
FLOW
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash or cash
equivalents of $525, other assets of $2,750, no revenue generating activities or other source of income and we had outstanding
liabilities of $77,790 and a shareholders’ deficit of $74,515.
By comparison, as of June 30, 2022, we did
not have any cash or cash equivalents, other assets of $5,958, no revenue generating activities or other source of income and we
had outstanding liabilities of $63,415 and a shareholders’ deficit of $57,457.
Consequently, we are now dependent on raising additional equity and/or debt to meet our ongoing operating expenses. There is no
assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary equity and/or debt that we will need to fund our ongoing operating expenses.
We
will be reliant, potentially, on advances from our principal shareholders or our directors and officers. There can be no guarantee
that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding these sources.
Our
principal shareholder has indicated his intention to provide such funds as may be required for the Company to become, and remain,
a fully reporting public company while seeking to create value for shareholders by merging with another entity with experienced
management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of its common stock. Such intentions do not represent a binding commitment
by the principal shareholder and there is no guarantee that our two principal shareholders will be able to provide the funding
necessary to achieve this objective.
We
currently believe that our principal shareholder will be able to provide us with the funding necessary to effect our business plan
to merge with another entity. However, while our principal shareholder has indicated his intention to provide us with sufficient
funding to achieve this objective, there is no guarantee that he will be able to provide funding necessary to enable us to merge
with another entity.
If
we are unable to obtain the necessary funding from our principal shareholder, we anticipate facing major challenges in raising
the necessary funding to effect our business plan to merge with another entity. Raising debt or equity funding for small publicly
quoted, penny stock, shell companies is always extremely challenging.
Future losses
are likely to occur as, until we are able to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth
in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders, we have no sources of income to meet our operating
expenses. As a result of these, among other factors, we received from our registered independent public accountants in their report
for the financial statements for  the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , an explanatory
paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern .
The following is a
summary of the Company’s cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the six-month

Operating Activities
During
the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 , we recognized a net loss $17,058   which
was reduced for cash flow purposes by a $3,208 decrease in prepaid expenses and a $514 increase in accounts payable resulting in
net cash of $13,336 being used in operating activities.
By comparison during
six-month period ended December 31, 2021 ,
we
incurred a net loss of $25,150
which was increased for cash flow purposes by a $2,750 increase in prepaid expenses, partially
offset by a $2,019 increase in accounts payable, resulting in $25,881 of cash being used in operating activities.
Investing Activities
We
did not engage in any investing activities during the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Financing Activities
During
the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 , we received net cash flows of $13,681 from financing activities: $4,861 by
way of loan from a related party and $9,000 by way of a promissory note from another related party.
By
comparison, during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 , we received net cash flows of $25,881 from financing activities:
all by way of loan from a related party.
We are dependent upon
the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan to merge with
another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value
for our shareholders. In addition, we are dependent upon our controlling shareholder to provide continued funding and capital resources.
If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
All companies are required to include a discussion
of critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of their financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate
our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are described
in Note 3 of our Condensed Unaudited Financial Statements above. These policies were selected because they represent the more significant
accounting policies and methods that are broadly applied in the preparation of our financial statements.
Inflation
To date inflation has not been a major factor
in our proposed business plan.  However, there are significant inflationary pressures in the larger economy. The impact of
inflation is being reflected in higher wages, increased pricing of equipment and products and generally higher prices across all
sectors of the economy.  We plan on carefully evaluating the impact of inflation and price increase pressures on our proposed
business plan.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Per SEC regulations, we are required to disclose
our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
such as changes  in  financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. As of December 31, 2022,  we  have
no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
Our management conducted an evaluation, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer,  who
is also  our  acting  principal financial and accounting officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in  Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of
the period covered by this Form 10-Q.  Based  on that evaluation,  we  concluded
that because of the material weakness and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting described below,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of  December 31, 2022 .
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for the preparation
of our financial statements and related information. Management uses its best judgment to ensure that the financial statements
present accurately,  in  material respects, our financial position and results
of operations  in  fairness and conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Exchange Act. These internal controls are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate,
and that the assumptions and opinions in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations
in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls, including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls. Consequently,
an ineffective internal control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to reporting financial
information.
Our internal control over financial reporting
includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial
statements  in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made  in  accordance
with our management’s and directors’ authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial
statements.
19
Table of Contents
We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework in “Internal Control  Integrated  Framework”
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and published in 2013, and
subsequent guidance prepared by COSO specifically for smaller public companies. Based on that evaluation, management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of  December 31,
2022  for the reasons discussed below.
A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, that adversely affects the entity’s ability to
initiate, authorize, record, process, or report financial data reliably  in  accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the entity’s
financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected by the entity’s internal control.
A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies  in  internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified the following material
weakness and significant deficiencies  in  its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2022 :
●
The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked personnel with accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.
●
Material Weakness – Inadequate segregation of duties.
There are no assurances that the material weaknesses
and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result  in  errors  in  our
financial statements, which could  lead  to a restatement of those financial
statements. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all
error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and maintained, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must account for resource
constraints. In addition, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,  if  any,
can and will be detected.
This Form 10-Q does not include an attestation
report from our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Commission that
permit us to provide only management’s report in this Form 10-Q.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the three month period ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
