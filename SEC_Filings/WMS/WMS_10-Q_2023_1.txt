(UNAUDITED) 1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business
-
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “ADS” or the “Company”), incorporated in Delaware, designs, manufactures and markets innovative water management solutions in the stormwater and onsite septic waste water industries, providing superior drainage solutions for use in the construction and agriculture marketplace. ADS’s products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, infrastructure and agriculture applications. The Company is managed and reports results of operations in
three
reportable segments: Pipe, Infiltrator Water Technologies Ultimate Holdings, Inc ("Infiltrator") and International. The Company also reports the results of its Allied Products and all other business segments as Allied Products and Other. Historically, sales of the Company’s products have been higher in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions accelerating construction activity during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay projects.

The Company prepares its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 was derived from audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K”).

The interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, filed in the Company’s Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K.
Principles of Consolidation
-
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments where it exercises significant influence but does not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are recorded in Other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related equity earnings from these investments are included in Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Recent Accounting Guidance
There have been no new accounting pronouncements issued or adopted since the filing of the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K that have significance, or potential significance, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 2. ACQUISITIONS Acquisition of Cultec -

NET INCOME PER SHARE AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") -
As previously disclosed in the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, in April 2022 all currently outstanding
15.6  million shares of Preferred Stock held by the ESOP were converted into
12.0  million shares of the Company’s redeemable common stock at the Conversion rate of
0.7692 . The Company’s 401(k) retirement plan (“KSOP”) holds these shares of common stock. When participants sell or forfeit these shares, the shares are no longer subject to the put option of the Internal Revenue Code and are no longer required to be classified in mezzanine equity. Net Income per Share
- For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company was required to apply the two-class method to compute both basic and diluted net income per share. Holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock participated in dividends on an as-converted basis when declared on common stock. As a result, redeemable convertible preferred stock met the definition of participating securities. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats participating securities as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common stockholders. The Company was not required to apply the two-class method to compute net income per share for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 as the redeemable common stock and common stock have the same rights to earnings available to common stockholders. - 11 - Table of Contents The following table presents information necessary to calculate net income per share for the periods presented, as well as potentially dilutive securities excluded from the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:   Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 2022 2021 NET INCOME PER SHARE—BASIC:       Net income attributable to ADS $ 82,040   $ 73,678   $ 421,193   $ 225,024   Adjustments for: Dividends to participating securities —   ( 1,357 ) —   ( 4,633 ) Net income available to common stockholders and participating securities 82,040   72,321   421,193   220,391   Undistributed income allocated to participating securities —   ( 9,457 ) —   ( 30,870 ) Net income available to common stockholders – Basic $ 82,040   $ 62,864   $ 421,193   $ 189,521   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding – Basic 82,067   71,267   82,891   71,087   Net income per common share – Basic $ 1.00   $ 0.88   $ 5.08   $ 2.67   NET INCOME PER SHARE—DILUTED: Net income available to common stockholders – Diluted $ 82,040   $ 62,864   $ 421,193   $ 189,521   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding – Basic 82,067   71,267   82,891   71,087   Assumed restricted stock 114   236   131   245   Assumed exercise of stock options 626   854   702   904   Assumed performance units 180   432   256   516   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding – Diluted 82,987 72,789 83,980 72,752 Net income per common share – Diluted $ 0.99   $ 0.86   $ 5.02   $ 2.61   Potentially dilutive securities excluded as anti-dilutive 42   12,271   45   13,240   Stockholders’ Equity

Overview
ADS is the leading manufacturer of innovative water management solutions in the stormwater and onsite septic wastewater industries, providing superior drainage solutions for use in the construction and agriculture marketplaces. Our innovative products, for which we hold many patents, are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, infrastructure and agriculture applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, industry-acclaimed engineering support, overall product breadth and scale plus manufacturing excellence. Executive Summary Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Results • Net sales decreased 8.4% to $655.2 million • Net income increased 11.7% to $83.2 million • Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 3.6% to $169.7 million Net sales decreased $60.2 million, or 8.4%, to $655.2 million, as compared to $715.4 million in the prior year quarter. Domestic pipe sales decreased $24.3 million, or 6.1%, to $375.7 million. Domestic allied products & other sales increased $1.6 million, or 1.1%, to $149.0 million. Infiltrator sales decreased $44.8 million, or 30.1%, to $103.9 million. The decrease in domestic net sales was driven by sales in the U.S. construction end markets. International sales increased $3.1 million, or 5.6%, to $59.0 million, driven by growth in the Canadian and Mexican businesses. Gross profit increased $14.9 million, or 7.1%, to $223.9 million as compared to $209.0 million in the prior year. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the favorable pricing on pipe, onsite septic and allied products as well as favorable material cost. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in volume, inflationary cost pressures and higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, decreased $6.4 million, or 3.6%, to $169.7 million, as compared to $176.2 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the factors mentioned above, as well as an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. As a percentage of Net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 25.9% as compared to 24.6% in the prior year. Year-to-date Fiscal 2023 Results • Net sales increased 17.3% to $2,453.6 million • Net income increased 86.5% to $425.0 million • Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure,
increased 44.2% to $732.0
million Net sales increased $362.4 million, or 17.3%, to $2,453.6 million, as compared to $2,091.1 million in the prior year quarter. Domestic pipe sales increased $243.0 million, or 21.0%, to $1,401.6 million. Domestic allied products & other sales increased $129.9 million, or 30.9%, to $550.2 million. Infiltrator sales decreased $0.4 million, or 0.1%, to $420.9 million. The increase in domestic net sales was driven by double-digit sales growth in the U.S. construction end markets.
- 19 - Table of Contents International sales increased $19.2 million, or 10.4%, to $203.9 million, driven by strong sales growth in the Canadian, Mexican and Exports businesses. Gross profit increased $285.8 million, or 46.8%, to $896.0 million as compared to $610.2 million in the prior year. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the favorable pricing on pipe, onsite septic and allied products as well as favorable material cost. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in volume, inflationary cost pressures and higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased $224.4 million, or 44.2%, to $732.0 million, as compared to $507.5 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the factors mentioned above. As a percentage of Net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 29.8% as compared to 24.3% in the prior year. Results of Operations

- 23 - Table of Contents A djusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
-
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, have been presented in this Form 10-Q as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as measures of financial performance or cash flows from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are included in this Form 10-Q because they are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our consolidated financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use these non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our consolidated business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We use Adjusted EBITDA Margin to evaluate our ability to generate profitable sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin contain certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs, cash expenditures to replace assets being depreciated and amortized and interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments on our indebtedness. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods presented.   Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31,   2022   2021 2022 2021   (In thousands)

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically we have funded our operations through internally generated cash flow supplemented by debt financings, equity issuance and finance and operating leases. These sources have been sufficient historically to fund our primary liquidity requirements, including working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments for our common stock. From time to time, we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. - 24 - Table of Contents The following table presents key liquidity metrics utilized by management. The table includes the non-GAAP measure, Free Cash Flow, which is further discussed and defined below, and Leverage ratio which is calculated as net debt divided by the trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA.   Nine Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 660,438  $ 193,847  Capital expenditures (126,858) (100,367) Free Cash Flow 533,580    93,480  Total debt (debt and finance lease obligations) 1,308,768      Cash 426,690      Net debt (total debt less cash) 882,078      Leverage Ratio 1.0     Free Cash Flow
- Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is a measure used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our ability to generate cash. Accordingly, free cash flow has been presented in this Form 10-Q as a supplemental measure of liquidity that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP, because management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a GAAP measure of our liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table summarizes our available liquidity for the period presented. (Amounts in thousands) December 31, 2022 Revolver capacity $ 600,000  Less: outstanding borrowings —  Less: letters of credit (9,650) Revolver available liquidity $ 590,350   In addition to the available liquidity above, we have the ability to borrow up to $1.3 billion under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to leverage ratio restrictions. Working Capital and Cash Flows
As of December 31, 2022, we had $1,017.1 million in liquidity, including $426.7 million of cash, $590.4 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Agreement, net of outstanding letters of credit. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Credit Agreement and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness for at least the next twelve months. Working Capital
- Working capital increased to $787.1 million as of December 31, 2022, from $480.7 million as of March 31, 2022. The increase in working capital is primarily due to increased cash from the issuance of our 2030 Notes and a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory due to seasonality.   Nine Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 660,438  $ 193,847  Net cash used in investing activities (174,822) (150,040) Net cash used in financing activities (78,590) (216,574) - 25 - Table of Contents Operating Cash Flows
–
Cash flows from operating activities increased $466.6 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by operating income and changes in net working capital. Investing Cash Flows
- Cash flows used in investing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $24.8 million compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $126.9 million and $100.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements and technology improvement initiatives. We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $175 million in fiscal year 2023, including approximately $80 million of open orders as of December 31, 2022. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. Financing Cash Flows
- During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities included the issuance of $500.0 million of 2030 Notes and proceeds of $123.2 million on our revolving credit facilities. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 included repurchase of common stock of $375.0 million, payments of $237.5 million on our revolving credit facilities, $30.1 million of dividend payments, and $28.7 million for shares withheld for tax purposes. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, cash used included the repurchase of common stock of $292.0 million, repayment of $124.6 million on the Revolving Credit Facility, $13.1 million of shares withheld for tax purposes, $27.8 million of dividend payments and payments on our finance lease obligations of $49.4 million. Cash provided by financing activities included proceeds of $258.1 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. Cash held by Foreign Subsidiaries -
As of December 31, 2022, we had $33.2 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries, including $23.3 million held by our Canadian subsidiaries. We continue to evaluate our strategy regarding foreign cash, but our earnings in foreign subsidiaries still remain indefinitely reinvested, except for Canada. We plan to repatriate earnings from Canada and believe that there will be no additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings other than any potential non-U.S. withholding taxes. Financing Transactions Senior Secured Credit Facility -

Excluding the guarantees of 50% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture as further discussed in “Note 7. Related Party Transactions” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, our South American Joint Venture had approximately $6.3 million of outstanding debt subject to our guarantees. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
There have been no changes in critical accounting policies from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, except as disclosed in "Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or other comparable terms. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not related to present facts or current conditions or that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Form 10-Q and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth strategies, and the industries in which we operate and include, without limitation, statements relating to our future performance.
Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and industry development may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. In addition, even if our actual consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and industry development are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements, including those reflected in forward-looking statements relating to our operations and business, the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Form 10-Q (including under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”), and those described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those reflected in forward-looking statements relating to our operations and business include: • fluctuations in the price and availability of resins and other raw materials and our ability to pass any increased costs of raw materials on to our customers in a timely manner; • the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics in the future; • disruption or volatility in general business and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate; • cyclicality and seasonality of the non-residential and residential construction markets and infrastructure spending; • the risks of increasing competition in our existing and future markets; • uncertainties surrounding the integration and realization of anticipated benefits of acquisitions and similar transactions; • the effect of any claims, litigation, investigations or proceedings, including those described under “Item 1. Legal Proceedings” of this Form 10-Q; • the effect of weather or seasonality; • the loss of any of our significant customers; • the risks of doing business internationally; • the risks of conducting a portion of our operations through joint ventures; • our ability to expand into new geographic or product markets;
• our ability to achieve the acquisition component of our growth strategy; • the risk associated with manufacturing processes; - 28 - Table of Contents • the effect of global climate change; • cybersecurity risks; • our ability to manage our supply purchasing and customer credit policies; • our ability to control labor costs and to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees and key personnel; • our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; • changes in laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations; • the risks associated with our current levels of indebtedness, including borrowings under our existing credit agreement and outstanding indebtedness under our existing senior notes; and • other risks and uncertainties, including those listed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” in the Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report and we do not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends, or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. Item 3.         Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to various market risks, primarily related to changes in interest rates, credit, raw material supply prices and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be negatively impacted in the event of adverse movements in the respective market rates or prices in each of these risk categories. Our exposure in each category is limited to those risks that arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative, non-operating transactions. Our exposure to market risk has not materially changed from what we previously disclosed in Part II. Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of our Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K except as disclosed below. Interest Rate Risk
- We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our bank debt. Changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, but there is no impact to earnings and cash flow. Alternatively, changes in interest rates do not affect the fair value of our variable-rate debt, but they do affect future earnings and cash flow. The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility bear variable interest rates. The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility bear interest either at SOFR or the Prime Rate, at our option, plus applicable pricing margins. A 1.0% increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt would increase our annual forecasted interest expense by approximately $4.2 million based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2022. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 1.0% increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would change our interest expense by approximately $10.2 million, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Item 4.         Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) are responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. - 29 - Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.         Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to commercial disputes, environmental matters, employee related claims, intellectual property disputes and litigation in connection with transactions including acquisitions and divestitures. The Company does not believe that such litigation, claims, and administrative proceedings will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Item 1A.     Risk Factors Important risk factors that could affect our operations and financial performance, or that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations, are described in “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors” of our Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. These factors are further supplemented by those discussed in “Part II, Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of our Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K and in “Part I, Item 3 — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and “Part II, Item 1 — Legal Proceedings” of this Form 10-Q.
Item 2.        Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds In February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion common stock repurchase program. Repurchase of common stock will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock at a cost of $179.9 million. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $625.0 million of common stock may be repurchased under the authorization.
