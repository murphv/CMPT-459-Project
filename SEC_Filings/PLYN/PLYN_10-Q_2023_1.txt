facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections. We may use words such as “anticipate,” “expect,”
“intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “foresee,” “estimate” and variations of these
words and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted. These risks and uncertainties include the following:
·
The availability and adequacy of our cash flow to meet our requirements;
·
Economic, competitive, demographic, business and other conditions in our local and regional markets;
·
Changes or developments in laws, regulations or taxes in our industry;
·
Actions taken or omitted to be taken by third parties including our suppliers and competitors, as well as legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities;
·
Competition in our industry;

The loss of or failure to obtain any license or permit necessary or desirable in the operation of our business;
·
Changes in our business strategy, capital improvements or development plans;
·
The availability of additional capital to support capital improvements and development; and
·
Other risks identified in this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
This report should be read completely and with
the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward-looking statements included
in this report are made as of the date of this report and should be evaluated with consideration of any changes occurring after the date
of this Report. We will not update forward-looking statements even though our situation may change in the future and we assume no obligation
to update any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future events or otherwise.

NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2022
1.
Organization History and Business
Organization and Business
We were incorporated in the State
of Nevada on July 26, 2013 as a mineral exploration and production company. On May 10, 2021, we issued a press release stating our Company
was changing its market focus – “Management recognizes that our Company needs to move in a new direction and will pursue acquisition
opportunities that can benefit private companies through our Company’s public status. The benefit to our Company and its stockholders
will be built on acquisitions based on growth and revenue of targeted acquisitions.”
We have restructured our Company
as a holding company seeking transactions on a managed basis, acquiring controlling interest in acquisition targets as subsidiaries of
our Company. Using a holding company strategy, we will be able to mitigate risk while making multiple acquisitions. All targeted acquisitions
must be audited or auditable. We will make either majority or minority investments in companies that meet our investment criteria.
As a holding company, we will
not manufacture anything, sell any products or services, or conduct any other business operations. Our purpose is to hold the controlling
stock or membership interests in other companies.
Our Company is taking an
agnostic approach regarding industry, in almost every contemplated acquisition, we will retain the management team of the acquired
company. The subsidiary’s own management will run the day-to-day business, as this retention of management post
transaction will maintain operational continuity. Our Company’s management will be responsible for overseeing how the
subsidiaries are run and assisting their management as needed.
Our Company is seeking opportunities
in mature private companies that are in transition or growth mode. Transactions will be subject to industry standard due-diligence requirements.
Using this new strategy, on December
9, 2021 we executed a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with a Singapore based holding company whose subsidiaries are
engaged principally in foreign exchange remittance services. In conducting our due diligence, the acquisition target was unable to supply
the information we required and, as a result, the MOU expired August 31, 2022.
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim
financial statements have been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). Certain information and disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
the accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these financial statements have been
included. Such adjustments consist of normal recurring adjustments. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with
our Company’s historical financial statements and related notes filed with the SEC including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 filed on June 28, 2022. The results of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
8
Going Concern Considerations
The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which contemplate continuation of
our Company as a going concern. We currently have no revenues, have incurred net losses, and have an accumulated deficit of $ 1,277,687
as of December 31, 2022. Effective December 4, 2020, we entered into a Credit Line Agreement with Mambagone, S.A de C.V. (“Mambagone”)
which allowed for advances totaling $ 1,050,000 . However, after advancing us $ 260,000
under the terms of the Credit Line Agreement, Mambagone
made no further advances. See Note 5 for further information. As such, there is uncertainty whether our capital needs over the next 12
months can be met and, as a result, there is reasonable doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date
of this report. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital to meet our working capital needs, we could be forced to cease operations.
The continuation of our Company
as a going concern is dependent upon continued financial support from our stockholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing,
and the attainment of profitable operations from any future business we may acquire. There are no assurances that we will be successful
in obtaining sufficient capital to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if our Company is unable to continue as a going concern
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance
provides an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the
use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market
participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of our
Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our Company’s assumptions about the factors that market participants would
use in valuing the asset or liability. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1
- Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2
- Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3
- Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
The fair value hierarchy also
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
Fair value estimates discussed
herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2022 and March 31,
2022. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial
instruments include cash, prepaid expense, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. Fair values for these items were assumed to approximate
carrying values because they are short-term in nature or they are payable on demand. Fair values for derivative liabilities were determined
under level 2 since inputs used are either directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Derivative Financial Instruments
– We account for convertible debt with conversion features representing embedded derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging. ASC 815-15-25-1 requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed on their issuance date
and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, we use the Black-Scholes option valuation
method, resulting in a reduction of the initial carrying amount of the notes as unamortized debt discount. The unamortized discount is
amortized over the term of each note using the effective interest method.
9
The fair value of derivative instruments
is recorded and shown separately under liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities are recorded in the consolidated
statement of operations under non-operating income (expense).
We evaluate each of our financial
instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative
financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is
then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based
derivative financial instruments, we use a weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments
at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should
be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within
twelve months of the balance sheet date.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
We compute net income (loss) per
share in accordance with ASC 260,
Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share
(“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders
(numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted
method. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, potentially
dilutive shares related to our convertible notes payable and Series A Preferred Stock have
no t been included in the diluted loss per share
computations as they would be antidilutive for the periods presented.
New Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all recently
issued accounting pronouncements and determined that they were either disclosed in our most recently filed Form 10-K or, based on current
operations, are not believed to have a material impact on our financial statements.
3.
Equipment, net
As of December 31, 2022, equipment
consists of a laptop computer. Depreciation is being calculated on a straight-line basis over a three-year period and was $ 282
for both
nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
4.
Related Party Transactions
Due to related parties of $ 219,810
as of December 31, 2022 consists of $ 204,019
in advances by C2C Business Strategies (“C2C”), a large stockholder, to cover
certain operating expenses, $ 9,000
owed to one of our outside Directors for Directors fees, and $ 6,791
owed to our CEO and Director, Mr.
James Jenkins. As of March 31, 2022, the balance of $ 54,582
consists of $ 52,332
in advances from C2C and $ 2,250
owed to the outside Director.
From time to time, we have received advances from certain of our large stockholders, which we reported on our Balance Sheets under the
caption Due to related parties. The advances bear no interest and are repayable on demand. Imputed interest is immaterial.
Under an April 1, 2020 Executive
Employment Agreement, as amended, we retained the services of Mr. Jenkins by and through C2C. We expensed $ 108,000
and $ 96,000
for Mr.
Jenkins services during each of the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

NON-RELATED PARTIES
Unsecured Credit Line Agreement
Effective December 4, 2020, we
entered into a Credit Line Agreement with Mambagone (“the LOC”) under which Mambagone agreed to advance our Company a total
of $ 1,050,000
on various dates specified in the LOC. Each advance under the LOC bears interest at
8 % per annum and matures, along with
all accrued and unpaid interest, on July 31, 2022. To date, Mambagone has advanced us $ 260,000 . Despite repeated requests on our part
for additional advances as required by the LOC, Mambagone made no further advances. Mambagone’s lack of performance under the LOC
created an event of default by the lender and we sent a letter to Mambagone, via Federal Express, dated December 15, 2021 notifying them
of such default and of our termination of the LOC which letter was received on December 31, 2021. According to the terms of the LOC, a
default by the lender results in a portion of the advances being considered to not be due and payable and shall be considered as forgiven
or fully discharged. Under the guidance of ASC 405-20-15-1, derecognition of a debt that has not been paid can only occur if the debtor
is legally released from the debt, either judicially or by the creditor. We have been unable to contact Mambagone and, as such, have not
yet met the criteria of the relevant guidance but are attempting to do so. Once met, we expect to extinguish at minimum a portion of the
debt. Until such time, our obligation to Mambagone is in default.
Mambagone has the right, but not
the obligation, at any time, to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest into fully paid and
non-assessable shares of our common stock. The conversion price shall be equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the average of the closing
price of our common stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the conversion date. We determined that the conversion
provisions of the Mambagone LOC contain an embedded derivative feature and we valued the derivative feature separately, recording debt
discount and derivative liabilities in accordance with the provisions of the advances. See Note 6. We are amortizing the debt discount
on a straight-line basis over the term of the advances. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded amortization
of debt discount of $ 55,581
and $ 124,510 , respectively. Interest expense in connection with this debt was $ 15,671
for both of the nine-month
periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
11
RELATED PARTY
Unsecured Promissory Note
On March 16, 2021, we issued an
unsecured promissory note to one of our large stockholders in the amount of $ 25,000 . The note bears interest at
10 % per annum and is payable
on demand. No demand has been made for payment against this note. Interest expense in connection with this note was $ 1,884
for both of
the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
6.
Derivative Liabilities
As stated in Note 5, Notes Payable,
we determined that the advances under the unsecured credit line agreement each contained an embedded derivative feature in the form of
a conversion provision which was adjustable based on future prices of our common stock. In accordance with ASC 815-10-25, each derivative
feature was initially recorded at its fair value using the Black-Scholes option valuation method and then re-valued at each reporting
date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet
as current or non-current based on whether net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the
balance sheet date.
The following table represents
our derivative liability activity for the nine months ended December 31, 2022:

shares of our $ 0.001
par value common stock and each holder is entitled to one (1) vote on all matters subject to a vote of stockholders.
There was no common stock activity
during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we issued the following shares:
1. 201,451
shares of our common stock to a vendor for services. These shares had been recorded in “Common
Stock to be Issued” at March 31, 2021.
2. 1,395,348
shares to the same vendor listed in item 1 above under the terms of a Services Agreement dated
April 16, 2021. See Note 8.
3. 1,153,334
shares to C2C in settlement of Due to related party debt.
4. 250,000
shares to our attorney in settlement of accounts payable of $ 15,000 . The shares were valued at
$1,000 based on an independent third-party valuation of the fair value of our common stock and, accordingly, we recorded a gain on extinguishment
of debt for this transaction.
8.
Service Agreement
On April 16, 2021, we entered
into a Services Agreement with Cicero Transact Group, Inc. Under the Agreement, Cicero has agreed to rebuild our website and social media
sites and help identify and introduce potential acquisition targets to our Company. Once an acquisition is completed, Cicero has agreed
to provide, at their sole discretion, any number of post-acquisition services listed in the Agreement. As consideration for the services,
we issued Cicero
1,395,348
shares of our restricted common stock which were vested on the date of the Agreement. We valued the shares
at $ 5,581 , based on a valuation of our Company done by an independent third-party, and recorded a general and administrative expense of
that amount during the three-month period ended June 30, 2021.
9.
Other Income
During the three months ended
December 31, 2022, we received $ 3,000
from a company interested in the possibility of making a business transaction with us. The funds
were to be used to pay for our annual registration fee with OTC Markets. The funds are not repayable to the payee and are not part of
any agreed-to business transaction. Accordingly, we have reported the funds as other income.

Item 2.      Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown
risks, significant uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed, or implied, by those forward-looking
statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates,
believes, estimates, predicts, intends, potential, proposed, or continue or the negative of those terms. These statements are only predictions.
In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking
statements. Although we believe that the exceptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future
results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed
in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Set forth below are certain of
our important accounting policies. For a full explanation of these and other of our important accounting policies, see Note 2 to Notes
to the Financial Statements in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 28, 2022.
Going Concern Considerations
Our financial statements are presented
in United States dollars and are prepared using the accrual method of accounting which conforms to US GAAP, which contemplate continuation
of our Company as a going concern.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared
COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak and any related adverse public health developments, has adversely affected
workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn. The impact on our Company is not currently determinable,
but management continues to monitor the situation.
We have generated no revenues
to date and have an accumulated deficit of $1,277,687 as of December 31, 2022. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent
upon the continued financial support from our stockholders, our ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable
operations from our Company’s future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Our Company’s plan of action
over the next twelve months is to raise capital.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We are required
to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates
are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be
materially different from our reported results.
14
Derivative Financial Instruments
We account for convertible debt
with conversion features representing embedded derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. ASC 815-15-25-1
requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed on their issuance date and measured at their fair value for accounting
purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, we use the Black-Scholes option valuation method, resulting in a reduction of the
initial carrying amount of the notes as unamortized debt discount. The unamortized discount is amortized over the term of each note using
the effective interest method.
The fair value of derivative instruments
is recorded and shown separately under liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities are recorded in the consolidated
statement of operations under non-operating income (expense).
We evaluate each of our financial
instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative
financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is
then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based
derivative financial instruments, we use a weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments
at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should
be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within
twelve months of the balance sheet date.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We review new accounting standards
as issued. Although some of these accounting standards issued or effective after the end of our previous fiscal year may be applicable
to us, we have not identified any standards that we believe merit further discussion. We believe that none of the new standards will have
a significant impact on our financial position, future operations or cash flows.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We have limited operational history.
From our inception on July 26, 2013 to December 31, 2022, we have not generated any revenues. Until such time as we generate revenues,
we anticipate we will incur losses.
Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to
Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Operating Expenses
During the three months ended
December 31, 2022, we incurred operating expenses of $62,110 compared to $60,010 in the previous year. The increase in expenses was caused
by a slight increase in professional fees.
Other Income and Expense
In the 2021 period, we reported
debt discount amortization ($41,914) and a gain on extinguishment of debt ($14,000), neither of which occurred in the 2022 period. In
2022 we reported derivative expense of $19,410 compared to derivative income of $35,747 in 2021, all related to our indebtedness to Mambagone
as explained in Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements. In 2022 we reported other income of $3,000 as described in Note Debt
9 to the accompanying financial statements.
Net Loss
Our net loss for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 of $84,393 ($0.00 per share) compares to a net loss of $58,050 ($0.00 per share) in the previous year.
15
Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to
Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021
Operating Expenses
During the nine months ended December
31, 2022, we incurred operating expenses of $195,111 compared to $202,607 in the previous year. The 2021 period contains an expense in
the amount of $5,581 resulting from our issuance of common stock under the Services Agreement described in Note 8 to the accompanying
financial statements. There is no such expense in the 2022 period. In addition, professional fees were slightly lower in the 2022 period
compared to 2021.
Other Income and Expense
Interest expense was $103 lower
in the 2022 period versus 2021. In the 2022 period, we reported derivative expense of $7,454 compared to derivative income of $112,651
in the 2021 period, all related to our indebtedness to Mambagone as explained in Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements. Debt
discount amortization in the 2022 period was $55,581 compared to $124,510 in 2021. The 2021 period contained a gain of extinguishment
of debt of $14,000 (none in 2022) while the 2022 period contained other income of $3,000 as described in Note 9 to the accompanying financial
statements (none in 2021).
Net Loss
Our net loss for the nine months
ended December 31, 2022 of $272,701 ($0.01 per share) compares to a net loss of $218,124 ($0.01 per share) in the previous year.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Since our initial share issuances,
our company has been unable to raise significant additional equity funds, forcing us to rely on cash advances and debt financing to meet
operating needs. We have no cash on hand at December 31, 2022 and we will be required to raise additional funds to execute our current
plan of operation. As discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements, although we have a credit line agreement with Mambagone,
S.A de C.V. (“Mambagone”), they are no longer honoring additional required advances under the agreement. At present, we have
no commitment from anyone to contribute funds to our Company. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to execute our plan of operation,
we intend to scale back our operations commensurately with the funds available to us.
We had hoped to raise the capital
that we require through the private placement of our securities or through loans. However, we have not received any financing commitments
and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in so doing.
We have no plant or significant
equipment to sell, nor are we going to buy any plant or significant equipment during the next 12 months. We do not intend to hire any
employees at this time.
CASH FLOWS
Operating Activities
During the nine months ended December
31, 2022, we used cash of $165,579 for operating activities compared to $171,507 during the same period in 2021. The decrease in cash
used was mainly attributable to the fact that our increased net loss was more than offset by changes in non-cash expenses in both periods
of derivative income/expense and amortization of debt discount and the 2021 gain on extinguishment of debt.
16
Investing Activities
There were no investing activities
during the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Financing Activities
Borrowings from related parties
increased to $165,228 in the 2022 period from $73,200 in the comparable 2021 period.
Trends
We have no revenue generating
operations and have no prospects of generating any revenue without making some form of acquisition. Otherwise, we are unaware of any known
trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our business or income, either in
the long term or short term.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our
stockholders.
Inflation
The effect of inflation on our
revenues and operating results has not been significant.
Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure about Market Risk

2022.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934) that materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December
31, 2022.
