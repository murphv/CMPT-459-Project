ORION ENERGY SYSTEMS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
UNAUDITED NOT ES TO THE CONDENSED C ONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Orion includes Orion Energy Systems, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, and all consolidated subsidiaries. Orion is a provider of energy-efficient LED lighting and controls, maintenance services and electrical vehicle (EV) charging station solutions to commercial and industrial businesses, and federal and local governments, predominantly in North America.
NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Orion and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Orion have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 or other interim periods. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Orion’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on June 10, 2022. Acquisition Related Costs Acquisition related costs includes various acquisition related costs, including legal fees, consulting and success fees, earn-out expenses, and other non-recurring integration related costs. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during that reporting period. Areas that require the use of significant management estimates include revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for warranty and loss contingencies, income taxes, impairment analyses, and certain equity transactions. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties Orion's cash is primarily deposited with
one
financial institution. At times, deposits in this institution exceeds the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Orion has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes that it is not exposed to any significant financial institution viability risk on these balances. 8
Orion purchases components necessary for its lighting products, including lamps and LED components, from multiple suppliers. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 ,
one
supplier accounted for
13.3 % of total cost of revenue. For the
nine months ended December 31, 2022 ,
no
suppliers accounted for more than
10.0 % of total cost of revenue. For the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 ,
no
suppliers accounted for more than
10.0 % of total cost of revenue. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 ,
one
customer accounted for
18.2 % and
16.1 % of total revenue, respectively. For the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 ,
one
customer accounted for
48.6 % and
53.0 % of total revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 ,
one
customer accounted for
12.3 % of accounts receivable, respectively. As of
March 31, 2022 ,
two
customers accounted for
11.8 % and
10.4 % of accounts receivable, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Issued: Not Yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires an entity to assess impairment of its financial instruments based on its estimate of expected credit losses. Since the issuance of ASU 2016-13, the FASB released several amendments to improve and clarify the implementation guidance. The provisions of ASU 2016-13 and the related amendments are effective for Orion for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2022. Entities are required to apply these changes through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Orion is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and the related footnote disclosures. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”), which requires an entity to use the guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than using fair value, when recognizing and measuring contract assets and contract liabilities related to customer contracts assumed in a business combination. The provisions of ASU 2021-08 are effective for Orion for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2022. Orion is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated balance sheet.
NOTE 3 — REVENU E Orion generates revenue primarily by selling manufactured or sourced commercial lighting fixtures and components, sourced electric vehicle chargers and related products, installing these products in customer’s facilities, and providing maintenance services including repairs and replacements for the lighting and related electrical components. Orion recognizes revenue in accordance with the guidance in “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”) when control of the goods or services being provided (which we refer to as a performance obligation) is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration Orion expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Orion acquired Voltrek LLC ("Voltrek"), which sells and installs sourced electric vehicle charging stations and related software subscriptions and renewals. The results of Voltrek are included in the Orion EV segment and compliment Orion’s existing turnkey installation model.
The sale of charging stations and related software subscriptions and renewals is presented in Product revenue.
Orion is the principal in the sales of charging stations as it has control of the physical products prior to transfer to the customer. Accordingly, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. For certain sales, primarily software subscriptions and renewals, Orion is the sales agent providing access to the content and recognize commission revenue net of amounts due to third parties who fulfill the performance obligation. For these sales, control passes at the point in time upon providing access of the content to the customer. 9
The sale of installation and services related to the EV charging business is presented in Service revenue. Revenue from the EV segment that includes both the sale of product and service is allocated between the product and service performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices, and is recorded in Product revenue and Service revenue, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Orion acquired Stay-Lite Lighting, Inc. ("Stay-Lite Lighting"), which provides lighting and electrical maintenance services. The results of Stay-Lite Lighting are included in the Orion Services Group segment and accelerate the growth of Orion’s maintenance services customer offering. The disaggregated revenue table provides total revenue from the maintenance services offering.
Revenue from the maintenance offering that includes both the sale of Orion manufactured or sourced product and service is allocated between the product and service performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices, and is recorded in Product revenue and Service revenue, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

As of December 31, 2022, due to a change in Orion's forecast, a triggering event occurred requiring Orion to evaluate the long-lived assets in its enterprise asset group for impairment. The enterprise asset group includes the corporate assets that support the revenue producing activities of other asset groups. Orion performed the recoverability test for the asset group by comparing its carrying value to the group’s expected future undiscounted cash flows. Orion concluded that the undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived asset group exceeded its carrying value. As such the asset group was deemed recoverable and no impairment was recorded.
NOTE 8 — LEASES From time to time, Orion leases assets from third parties. Orion also leases certain assets to third parties.
Orion accounts for leases in accordance with ASC 842. Under ASC 842, both finance and operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with initial terms in excess of 12 months are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Orion recognizes lease expense for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, referred to as short term leases, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. A summary of Orion’s assets leased from third parties follows (dollars in thousands):

Assets Orion Leases to Other Parties One of Orion’s frequent customers purchases products and installation services under agreements that provide for monthly payments, at a fixed monthly amount, of the contract price, plus interest, typically over a five-year period. While Orion retains ownership of the light fixtures during the financing period, the transaction terms and the underlying economics associated with used lighting fixtures results in Orion essentially ceding ownership of the lighting fixtures to the customer after completion of the agreement. The portions of the transaction associated with the sale of the light fixtures is accounted for as a sales-type lease under ASC 842. The total transaction price in these contracts is allocated between the lease and non-lease components in the same manner as the total transaction price of other turnkey projects containing lighting fixtures and installation services.
Revenues, and production and acquisition costs, associated with sales-type leases are included in Product revenue and Costs of product revenues in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The following chart shows the amount of revenue and cost of sales arising from sales-type leases during the

NOTE 11 — NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and does not consider common stock equivalents. Diluted net income per common share reflects the dilution that would occur if stock options were exercised and restricted shares vested. In the computation of diluted net income per common share, Orion uses the treasury stock method for outstanding options and restricted shares. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, Orion was in a net loss position; therefore, the Basic and Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are equal because any increase to the basic shares would be anti-dilutive.
Net income per common share is calculated based upon the following shares:

Revolving Credit Agreement
On December 29, 2020, Orion entered into a new $ 25
million Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as lender (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement replaced Orion’s prior $ 20.15
million secured revolving credit and security agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”).
The replacement of the Prior Credit Agreement with the Credit Agreement provides Orion with increased financing capacity and liquidity to fund its operations and implement its strategic plans. The Credit Agreement provides for a
five-year
$ 25.0
million revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures on
December 29, 2025 . Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base requirement based on eligible receivables, inventory and cash. As of
December 31, 2022 , the borrowing base supported $ 16.3
million of availability under the Credit Facility. As of
December 31, 2022 , $ 5.0
million was borrowed under the Credit Facility. Effective November 4, 2022, Orion, with Bank of America, N.A. as lender, executed Amendment No. 1 to its Credit Agreement. The primary purpose of the amendment was to include the assets of the acquired subsidiaries, Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek, as secured collateral
under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, eligible assets of Stay-Lite and Voltrek will be included in the borrowing base calculation for the purpose of establishing the monthly borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. The amendment also clarifies that the earnout liabilities associated with the Stay-Lite and Voltrek transactions are permitted under the Credit Agreement and that the expenses recognized in connection with those earnouts should be added back in the computation of EBITDA, as defined, under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, Orion was in compliance with all debt covenants. Equipment Debt Obligations
In February 2019, Orion entered into additional debt agreements with a financing company in the principal amount of $ 44
thousand and $ 30
thousand to fund the purchase of certain equipment. The debts are secured by the related equipment. The debts bear interest at a rate of
6.43 % and
8.77 % per annum, respectively, and both debts mature in
January 2024 .
NOTE 13 — INCOME TAXES Orion’s income tax provision was determined by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate, based upon the facts and circumstances known, to book income (loss) before income tax, adjusting for discrete items. Orion’s actual effective tax rate is adjusted each interim period, as appropriate, for changes in facts and circumstances. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , Orion recorded income tax expense of $ 19.4
million and $ 0.2
million, respectively, using this methodology.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , Orion recorded income tax expense of $ 17.9
million and $ 2.4
million, respectively, using this methodology. The increase in the Company’s tax expense relates primarily to a non-cash charge of $ 17.8
million in relation to recording a valuation allowance associated with the Company’s domestic federal and state deferred tax assets. 16
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 , Orion has a recorded valuation allowance of $ 19.1
million and $ 1.2
million, respectively, against its net deferred tax asset balance. The accounting forecasts, as revised in the current quarter, projects losses in the near term.
Orion now projects a 36-month cumulative loss starting from fiscal year 2023.
As such, Orion management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized and an increase to the valuation allowance has been recorded in the third quarter, which increased tax expense by $17.8 million. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. Orion considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event that Orion determines that the more or less of its deferred tax assets are able to be realized, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be reflected in the company’s provision for income taxes.
Uncertain Tax Positions As of December 31, 2022 , Orion’s balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $ 0.2
million, all of which would reduce Orion’s effective tax rate if recognized. Orion has classified the amounts recorded for uncertain tax benefits in the balance sheet as Other long-term liabilities to the extent that payment is not anticipated within one year. Orion recognizes penalties and interest related to uncertain tax liabilities in income tax (benefit) expense. Penalties and interest are included in the unrecognized tax benefits.
NOTE 14 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation Orion is subject to various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Orion does not believe the final resolution of any of such claims or legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on Orion’s future results of operations or financial condition.
State Tax Assessment During fiscal year 2018, Orion was notified of a pending sales and use tax audit by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue for the period covering April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2017. This sales and use tax audit was settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 with no tax adjustment.
NOTE 15 — SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Employee Stock Purchase Plan In August 2010, Orion’s Board of Directors approved a non-compensatory employee stock purchase plan, or “ESPP”. In the three months ended December 31, 2022 ,

Sale of shares In March 2020, Orion filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the shelf registration statement, Orion currently has the flexibility to publicly offer and sell from time to time up to $ 100
million
17
of
debt and/or equity securities. The filing of the shelf registration statement may help facilitate Orion’s ability to raise public equity or debt capital to expand existing businesses, fund potential acquisitions, invest in other growth opportunities, repay existing debt, or for other general corporate purposes. In March 2021, Orion entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement to undertake an “at the market” (ATM) public equity capital raising program pursuant to which Orion may offer and sell shares of common stock from time to time, having an aggregate offering price of up to $ 50
million.
No
share sales have been effected pursuant to the ATM program through
December 31, 2022 .
NOTE 16 — STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES At Orion’s 2019 annual meeting of shareholders held on August 7, 2019, Orion’s shareholders approved the Orion Energy Systems, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “Amended 2016 Plan”). The Amended 2016 Plan increased the number of shares of Orion’s common stock available for issuance under the Amended 2016 Plan from
1,750,000
shares to
3,500,000
shares (an increase of
1,750,000
shares); added a minimum vesting period for all awards granted under the Amended 2016 Plan (with limited exceptions); and added a specific prohibition on the payment of dividends and dividend equivalents on unvested awards. The Amended 2016 Plan authorizes grants of equity-based and incentive cash awards to eligible participants designated by the Plan's administrator. Awards under the Amended 2016 Plan may consist of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive awards or dividend equivalent units.
Prior to the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, Orion maintained its 2004 Stock and Incentive Awards Plan, as amended, which authorized the grant of cash and equity awards to employees (the “2004 Plan”). No new awards are being granted under the 2004 Plan; however, all awards granted under the 2004 Plan that are outstanding will continue to be governed by the 2004 Plan. Forfeited awards originally issued under the 2004 Plan are canceled and are not available for subsequent issuance under the 2004 Plan or under the Amended 2016 Plan. The Amended 2016 Plan and the 2004 Plan also permit accelerated vesting in the event of certain changes of control of Orion as well as under other special circumstances.

NOTE 18 — ACQUISITION Acquisition of Voltrek Effective on October 5, 2022, Orion acquired all the membership interests of Voltrek, an electric vehicle charging station solutions provider for a purchase price of $ 5.0
million in cash and $ 1.0
million of shares of common stock of Orion, subject to normal and customary closing adjustments (the “Voltrek Acquisition”). In addition, depending upon the relative EBITDA growth of Voltrek’s business in fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025, Orion could pay up to an additional $ 3.0
million, $ 3.5
million and $ 7.15
million, respectively, in earnout payments. These compensatory payments do not fall within the scope of ASC 805, Business Combinations, and will be expensed over the course of the earnout periods to the extent they are earned. The Voltrek Acquisition was funded from existing cash resources and Orion shares. Voltrek will operate as Voltrek, an Orion Energy Systems business. The Voltrek Acquisition leverages Orion’s project management and maintenance expertise into a rapidly growing sector.   Orion has accounted for the Voltrek Acquisition as a business combination. Orion has preliminarily allocated the purchase price of approximately $ 6.7
million to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at estimated fair values, and the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price was paid in cash and
620,067
shares of common stock with a total market value of $ 1.0
million, which is recorded in the opening balance sheet at fair value of $ 0.8
million, the discount on which is due to lock-up requirements on the shares.

Goodwill recorded from the Voltrek Acquisition is attributable to the skillset of the acquired workforce. The goodwill resulting from the Voltrek Acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets include amounts recognized for the fair value of the trade name, vendor relationship and customer relationships . The tradename intangible asset was valued using a relief from royalty method.
The significant assumptions used include the estimated revenue and royalty rate, among other factors.   20
The vendor relationship intangible asset was valued using the income approach – excess earnings method.
The significant assumptions include estimated revenue, cost of goods sold, and probability of renewal, among other factors.   The customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the income approach – with-and-without method.
The significant assumptions include estimated cash flows (including appropriate revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses attributable to the asset, retention rate, among other factors), and discount rate, reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flow stream, among other factors. The categorization of the framework used to measure fair value of the intangible assets is considered to be within the Level 3 valuation hierarchy due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used.

Voltrek's post-acquisition results of operations since October 5, 2022 are included in Orion’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operating results of Voltrek are included in the EV segment. See note 17 – Segments, for results. Acquisition of Stay-Lite Lighting Effective on January 1, 2022, Orion acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Stay-Lite Lighting, a nationwide lighting and electrical maintenance service provider, for $ 4.3
million (the “Stay-Lite Acquisition”). Stay-Lite Lighting operates as Stay-Lite Lighting, an Orion Energy Systems business. The Stay-Lite Acquisition accelerates the growth of Orion's maintenance services offerings through its Orion Services Group, which provides lighting and electrical services to customers. Orion has accounted for this transaction as a business combination. Orion has allocated the purchase price of approximately $ 4.3
million, which includes an estimate of the earn-out liability of $ 0.2
million and $ 0.1
million for the working capital adjustment received in the first quarter fiscal 2023, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at estimated fair values, and the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values is recorded as goodwill. Orion could pay up to $ 0.7
million in earnout related purchase price, which is based on performance during the current and following calendar years. Any accretion of the earnout liability above $ 0.2
million recorded as part of the opening balance sheet will be recognized as expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Stay-Lite Lighting’s post-acquisition results of operations since January 1, 2022 are included in Orion’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operating results of Stay-Lite Lighting are included in the Orion Services Group segment.
If Voltrek was acquired on April 1, 2022, the pro forma Orion revenue for the nine-month period ended on December 31, 2022 would have been $ 58.2
million and proforma net loss would have been $( 28.9 ) million. If both Stay-Lighting and Voltrek had been acquired as of April 1, 2021, Orion full year fiscal 2022 revenue would have been $ 134.9
million and net income would have been $ 5.8
million.
The pro forma information was determined based on the historical results of Orion and unaudited financial results from Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek. These proforma results reflect additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant, and equipment and intangible asset occurred at the beginning of the period, along with consequential tax effects. The unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the business combinations been completed at the beginning of the period or the results that may occur in the future. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect the impact of any synergies resulting from the acquisitions.   Transaction costs related to the Stay-Lite Acquisition and the Voltrek Acquisition are recorded in acquisition costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Transaction costs totaled $ 0.2
million in the three and nine months ending December 31, 2021 and $ 0.5
million and $ 0.8
million in the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 , respectively.

Overview
We provide energy-efficient LED lighting and controls, maintenance services and electrical vehicle (EV) charging station solutions. We help our customers achieve their sustainability, energy savings and carbon footprint reduction goals through innovative technology and exceptional service. We research, design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, install, and implement energy management systems consisting primarily of high-performance, energy-efficient commercial and industrial interior and exterior LED lighting systems and related services. Our products are targeted for applications in three primary market segments: commercial office and retail, area lighting, and industrial applications, although we do sell and install products into other markets. Our services consist of turnkey installation and system maintenance. Virtually all our sales occur within North America.
Our lighting products consist primarily of LED lighting fixtures, many of which include IoT enabled control systems. Our principal customers include large national account end-users, federal and state government facilities, large regional account end-users, electrical distributors, electrical contractors and energy service companies ("ESCOs"). Currently, most of our products are manufactured at our leased production facility located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, although as the LED and related IoT market continues to evolve, we are increasingly sourcing products and components from third parties in order to provide versatility in our product development.
We differentiate ourselves from our competitors through offering comprehensive project management services to national account customers to retrofit their multiple locations. Our comprehensive services include initial site surveys and audits, utility incentive and government subsidy management, engineering design, and project management from delivery through to installation and controls integration. In addition, we began to offer lighting and electrical maintenance services in fiscal 2021 which enables us to support a lifetime business relationship with our customer. We completed the acquisition of Stay-Lite Lighting on January 1, 2022, which is intended to further expand our maintenance services capabilities. On October 5, 2022, we acquired Voltrek, which is intended to leverage our project management and maintenance expertise into the rapidly growing EV sector.
We believe the market for LED lighting products and related controls continues to grow. Due to their size and flexibility in application, we also believe that LED lighting systems can address opportunities for retrofit applications that cannot be satisfied
23
by other lighting technologies. Our LED lighting technologies have become the primary component of our revenue as we continue to strive to be a leader in the LED market.
In fiscal 2022, we continued to successfully capitalize on our capability of being a full service, turn-key provider of LED lighting and controls systems with design, build, installation and project management services, as we continued a very large project for a major national account which was substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year. As a result of this success, we have begun to evolve our business strategy to focus on further expanding the nature and scope of our products and services offered to our customers. This further expansion of our products and services includes pursuing projects to develop recurring revenue streams, including providing lighting and electrical maintenance services and utilizing control sensor technology to collect data and assisting customers in the digitization of this data, along with other potential services. We also plan to pursue the expansion of our IoT, “smart-building” and “connected ceiling” and other related technology, software and controls products and services that we offer to our customers. We currently plan on investing significant time, resources and capital into expanding our offerings in these areas with no expectation that they will result in us realizing material revenue in the near term and without any assurance they will succeed or be profitable. In fact, it is likely that these efforts will reduce our profitability, at least in the near term as we invest resources and incur expenses to develop these offerings. While we intend to pursue these expansion strategies organically, we also are actively exploring potential business acquisitions, like our acquisition of Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek, which would more quickly add these types of expanded and different capabilities to our product and services offerings. It is possible that the acquisitions of Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek, or other potential acquisitions, if successfully completed, could significantly change, and potentially transform, the nature and extent of our business.
We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers for product or turnkey services that provide us with recurring annual revenue. However, some of our maintenance services contracts consist of multi-year arrangements. We typically generate substantially all our revenue from sales of lighting and control systems and related services to governmental, commercial and industrial customers on a project-by-project basis. We also perform work under master services or product purchasing agreements with major customers with sales completed on a purchase order basis. In addition, in order to provide quality and timely service under our multi-location master retrofit agreements we are required to make substantial working capital expenditures and advance inventory purchases that we may not be able to recoup if the agreements or a substantial volume of purchase orders under the agreements are delayed or terminated. The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, any of our significant customers, or our current single largest customer, or the termination or delay of a significant volume of purchase orders by one or more key customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given future period.
We typically sell our lighting systems in replacement of our customers’ existing fixtures. We call this replacement process a "retrofit". We frequently engage our customer’s existing electrical contractor to provide installation and project management services. We also sell our lighting systems on a wholesale basis, principally to electrical distributors and ESCOs to sell to their own customer bases.
The gross margins of our products can vary significantly depending upon the types of products we sell, with margins typically ranging from 10% to 50%. As a result, a change in the total mix of our sales among higher or lower margin products can cause our profitability to fluctuate from period to period.
Our fiscal year ends on March 31. Our current fiscal year ends on March 31, 2023 and is referred to as “fiscal 2023”. We refer to our just completed fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2022, as "fiscal 2022", and our prior fiscal year which ended on March 31, 2021 as "fiscal 2021". Our fiscal first quarter of each fiscal year ends on June 30, our fiscal second quarter ends on September 30, our fiscal third quarter ends on December 31 and our fiscal fourth quarter ends on March 31.
Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is our chief executive officer. Orion has three reportable segments: Orion Services Group Division ("OSG"), and Orion Distribution Services Division ("ODS"), and Orion U.S. Markets Division (“USM”). With our acquisition of Voltrek on October 5, 2022, we have now added a fourth reporting segment, Orion Electric Vehicle Charging Division (“EV”).
24
Acquisitions
Acquisition of Voltrek
Effective on October 5, 2022, we acquired all the membership interests of Voltrek, an electric vehicle charging station solutions provider, for a purchase price of $5.0 million in cash and $1.0 million of shares of common stock of Orion, subject to normal and customary closing adjustments. In addition, depending upon the relative EBITDA growth of Voltrek’s business in fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025, we could pay up to an additional $3.0 million, $3.5 million and $7.15 million, respectively, in earnout payments. Those compensatory payments do not fall within the scope of ASC 805, Business Combinations, and will be expensed over the course of the earnout periods to the extent they are earned. The acquisition was funded from existing cash resources and our common stock. Voltrek will operate as Voltrek, an Orion Energy Systems business. The acquisition leverages our project management and maintenance expertise into the rapidly growing EV sector.
Acquisition of Stay-Lite Lighting
Effective on January 1, 2022, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Stay-Lite Lighting, a nationwide lighting and electrical maintenance service provider, for a cash purchase price of $4.0 million. In addition, depending upon Stay-Lite Lighting's performance during the current and following calendar years, Orion could pay up to an additional $0.7 million in earn out related purchase price. The acquisition was funded from existing cash resources. Stay-Lite Lighting operates as Stay-Lite, an Orion Energy Systems business. The acquisition accelerates the growth of our maintenance services offerings through our Orion Services Group, which provides lighting and electrical services to customers.
Recent Developments
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we substantially completed a significant project rollout for our large national retail customer.
As expected, during fiscal 2023, we continue to support this customer, but at substantially lower revenue levels than in the comparative prior year. Despite the anticipated $50 million decrease in business from our largest customer and an online retailer in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the remainder of our business has grown by approximately 9% over the year-ago period. Our fiscal 2023 third quarter results reflect the continuation of delays in the initiation of certain large customer projects, as well as slower than expected activity in our electrical contractor distribution channel.
While we believe our long-term growth prospects remain very favorable, current business and economic challenges could continue to impact the pace of projects, as well as new product and service opportunities.
Our new EV segment is off to an excellent start and should exceed our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2023.
This helps confirm that the investments we are making to diversify our business are paying off.
We expect our maintenance business, with its recurring revenues, and EV business to accelerate as we fully activate cross-selling activities, we believe they will represent a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal 2024.

Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin.
Product revenue decreased 30.6%, or $6.8 million, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Service revenue decreased 42.6%, or $3.6 million, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in product and service revenue was due to the expected significantly lower revenues from our largest customer and comparatively lower project volume from other customers. The revenue from our existing large national retail customer represented 18.2% of total revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 48.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in the third quarter revenue was partially offset by revenues due to the acquisitions of Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek. Cost of product revenue decreased by 30.1%, or $4.9 million, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2022. Cost of service revenue decreased by 39.4%, or $2.6 million, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2022. The decrease in product and service costs was primarily due to the decrease in revenue. Gross margin decreased from 24.9% of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to 23.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, due primarily to reduced sales decreasing the absorption of fixed costs.
Operating Expenses
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expenses increased 38.7%, or $1.1 million, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. This comparative increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek and an acceleration of stock-based compensation expense due to retirement-related modifications of existing restricted stock awards.
Acquisition Costs.
Acquisition expenses increased $1.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. This comparative increase was primarily due to the earnout expense of $1.5 million related to the acquisition of Voltrek.
Sales and Marketing.
Sales and marketing expenses increased 4.2%, or $0.1 million, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, reflecting a reduction in commission expense on lower sales, partially offset by costs of the acquired businesses which were not in the prior period.
26
Research and Development.
Research and development expenses were relatively flat, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
Income Taxes.
Based on our recent financial results and near-term expectations, a non-cash tax charge of $17.8 million
has been recorded as a result of the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Orion Services Group Division
Our OSG segment develops and sells lighting products and provides construction, engineering along with installation and maintenance services for our commercial lighting and energy management systems. OSG provides engineering, design, lighting products and in many cases turnkey solutions for large national accounts, governments, municipalities, schools and other customers.

OSG segment revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased by 56.9%, or $11.4 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in OSG segment revenue was due to a significant reduction of project volume from our largest customer and comparatively lower project volume from other customers. This revenue decrease was partially offset by the added revenue from Stay-Lite Lighting. This decrease led to a corresponding operating loss in this segment, as a result of decreased absorption of fixed costs.

Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin.
Product revenue decreased 46.7%, or $36.5 million, for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 versus the first nine months of fiscal 2022. Service revenue decreased 41.7%, or $10.0 million, for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 versus the first nine months of fiscal 2022. The decrease in product and service revenue was due to the expected significantly lower project revenues from our largest customer and comparatively lower project volume from other customers, primarily caused by the response of customers to supply chain disruptions and other delays. The revenue from our existing large national retail customer represented 16.1% of total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to 53.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by revenues due to the acquisitions of Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek. Cost of product revenue decreased by 43.1%, or $23.6 million, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2022. Cost of service revenue decreased by 37.5%, or $7.1 million, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2022. The decrease in product and service costs was primarily due to the decrease in revenue. Gross margin decreased from 28.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 to 22.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, due primarily to reduced sales decreasing the absorption of fixed costs.
Operating Expenses
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expenses increased 33.7%, or $2.9 million, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2022. This comparative increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek and an acceleration of stock-based compensation expense due to retirement modifications of existing restricted stock awards.
Acquisition Costs.
Acquisition expenses increased $2.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. This comparative increase was primarily due to the earnout expense of $1.5 million, related to the acquisition of Voltrek.
Sales and Marketing.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased 3.1%, or $0.3 million, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2022, reflecting a reduction in commission expense on lower sales, partially offset by increased employment costs.
Research and Development.
Research and development expenses increased 17.5%, or $0.2 million, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2022, as a result of increased employment costs and testing.
29
Income Taxes.
Based on our recent financial results and near-term expectations, a non-cash tax charge of $17.8 million has been recorded as a result of the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
We believe our existing cash and operating cash flow provide us with the financial flexibility needed to meet our capital requirements, including to fund targeted capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital for at least one year from the date of this report, as well as our longer-term capital requirements for periods beyond at least one year from the date of this report.
We had approximately $8.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, compared to $14.5 million at March 31, 2022. Our cash position decreased as a result of an operating loss and an overall use of working capital during the first nine months of fiscal 2023.
Our future liquidity needs and forecasted cash flows are dependent upon many factors, including our relative revenue, gross margins, cash management practices, cost containment, working capital management, capital expenditures. While we believe that we will likely have adequate available cash and equivalents and credit availability under our Credit Agreement to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current cash flow forecast. If we experience significant liquidity constraints, we may be required to issue equity or debt securities, reduce our sales efforts, implement additional cost savings initiatives or undertake other efforts to conserve our cash.

Cash Flows Related to Operating Activities.
Cash used in operating activities primarily consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt issue costs, provisions for reserves, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.
31
Cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was $5.2 million and consisted of our net loss of $29.2 million adjusted for non-cash expense items and net cash used in changes in operating assets of $24.0 million, the largest of which was a $17.9 million decrease in deferred income tax assets as a result of the valuation allowance.
Cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 was $2.3 million and consisted of our net income of $7.3 million adjusted for non-cash expense items of $4.4 million offset by working capital uses of $9.4 million, the largest of which was a $5.2 million decrease in accounts payable.
Cash Flows Related to Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities of $6.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of cash funded for the acquisition of Voltrek and purchases of property and equipment.
Cash used in investing activities of $4.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 consisted primarily $3.7 million of cash funded for the acquisition of Stay-Lite Lighting, and an investment of a non-controlling equity stake in ndustrial, Inc. of $0.5 million and purchases of property and equipment.
Cash Flows Related to Financing Activities.
Cash provided by financing activities of $5.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 consisted primarily of proceeds from our Credit Agreement, which was drawn down to pay the cash purchase price to acquire Voltrek.
Cash provided by financing activities of $0.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of proceeds from employee equity exercises.
Working Capital
Our net working capital as of December 31, 2022 was $24.5 million, consisting of $46.6 million in current assets and $22.1 million in current liabilities. Our net working capital as of March 31, 2022 was $32.9 million, consisting of $51.2 million in current assets and $18.4 million in current liabilities.
We generally attempt to maintain at least a three-month supply of on-hand inventory of purchased components and raw materials to meet anticipated demand, as well as to reduce our risk of unexpected raw material or component shortages or supply interruptions. Because of recent supply chain challenges, we have been making additional incremental inventory purchases. Our accounts receivables, inventory and payables may increase to the extent our revenue and order levels increase.
Indebtedness
Revolving Credit Agreement
On December 29, 2020, we entered into a new $25 million Loan and Security Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as lender (the “Lender”). The Credit Agreement replaced our prior $20.15 million secured revolving credit and security agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”).
The replacement of the Prior Credit Agreement with the Credit Agreement provides us with increased financing capacity and liquidity to fund our operations and implement our strategic plans.
The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $25.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures on December 29, 2025. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base requirement based on eligible receivables, inventory and cash. As of December 31, 2022, the borrowing base supports $16.3 million availability of the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, $5.0 million was borrowed under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Agreement is secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of our assets.
Effective November 4, 2022, we, along with the Lender, executed Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement. The primary purpose of the amendment was to include the assets of our acquired subsidiaries, Stay-Lite Lighting and Voltrek as secured collateral under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, eligible assets of Stay-Lite and Voltrek will be included in the borrowing
32
base calculation for the purpose of establishing the monthly borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. The amendment also clarifies that the earnout liabilities associated with the Stay-Lite and Voltrek transactions are permitted under the Credit Agreement and that the expenses recognized in connection with those earnouts should be added back in the computation of EBITDA, as defined, under the Credit Agreement.
Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize in the future as a result of firm, committed purchase orders. Backlog totaled $19.5 million and $10.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We generally expect our backlog to be recognized as revenue within one year, although the COVID-19 pandemic may extend this time period.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Inflation
We have experienced increases in various input costs including labor, components and transportation in the past year. In response, we have implemented multiple price increases, and we have substantially mitigated the inflationary pressures, such that our results from operations have not been materially affected to date by inflation. We are monitoring input costs and cannot currently predict the future impact on our operations by increasing or ongoing inflationary pressures.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, stock-based compensation, warranty reserves and income taxes. The estimates of forecasted cash flows are used in the assessment for impairment of long-lived assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth in the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, there were no material changes in our accounting policies.
