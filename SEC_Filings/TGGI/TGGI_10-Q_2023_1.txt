ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND
Trans
Global Group, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed in the State of Delaware on December 31, 1993 as Teletek, Inc. On October,
2007, the Company changed its name to Trans Global Group, Inc., its current name. The Company’s purpose is to seek, investigate
and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire
to seek the perceived advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Exchange Act. The Company will not restrict its search to any
specific business, industry, or geographical location and the Company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or
nature and we have not established any particular criteria upon which we consider a business opportunity. This discussion of the proposed
business herein is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of the Company’s virtually unlimited discretion to search
for and enter into potential business opportunities. Management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential
business venture because the Company has nominal assets and limited financial resources.
On
August 8, 2022, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with ZXG Holdings Limited
(“ZXGBVI”), a BVI Business company. the sole shareholder of ZXGBVI, Southsea Global Limited. (“Southsea”), a
BVI Business Company, which is wholly
100 % owned by Mrs. Woo Shuk Fan (“Woo”), and Woo, as the officer, director and shareholder
of Southsea. Under the Share Exchange Agreement, One Hundred Percent (100%) of the ownership interest of ZXGBVI was exchanged for
1,465,761,689
shares of common stock
and closed the acquisition of
ZXGBVI on June 30, 2022.
The
Company’s accounting year-end is December 31.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
The
Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Management
further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of
internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal accounting control is designed
to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded
in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented.
Basis
of consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The results of subsidiaries acquired during the respective periods are included in the consolidated statements
of operations from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. The portion of the income
or loss applicable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates relate to income taxes and contingencies.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known or expected trends, and various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable given the quality of information available as of the date of these financial statements. The results of these assumptions
provide the basis for making estimates about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Foreign
currency translation and re-measurement
The
functional currency of the Company is the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”).
The
Company, whose translates their accounts into the U.S. dollar as follows:
●
Assets
and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date
●
Equities
at the historical rate
●
Revenue
and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period
Adjustments
arising from such translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.
Schedule of foreign
exchange rate
As of and for the nine months ended September 30,
2022
2021
Spot USD: RMB exchange rate
$ 7.11594
$ 6.44664
Average USD: RMB exchange rate
$ 6.59807
$ 6.47166
The
RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions.
No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US Dollars at the rates used in translation.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash and cash equivalents
are on deposit with financial institutions without any restrictions. As of
September
30 , 2022 and December 31, 2021, cash equivalents amounted to $ 48,664

Operating
leases
The
Company recognizes its leases in accordance with ASC 842 - Leases. Under ASC 842, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets
and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets represent
our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. The initial lease liability is equal to the future fixed minimum lease payments discounted using the Company’s
incremental borrowing rate, on a secured basis. The lease term includes option renewal periods and early termination payments when it
is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those rights. The initial measurement of the ROU asset is equal to the initial lease
liability plus any initial direct costs and prepayments, less any lease incentives. The Company elected the short-term lease exemption
for contracts with lease terms of 12 months or less. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components of its leases as a single
lease component. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Revenue
recognition
The
Company follows the guidance of ASC 606, revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using the following five steps:
1.
Identify
the contract(s) with a customer;
2.
Identify
the performance obligations in the contract;
3.
Determine
the transaction price;
4.
Allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
5.
Recognize
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Under
Topic 606, revenues are recognized when the promised products have been confirmed of delivery or services have been transferred to the
consumers in amounts that reflect the consideration the customer expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. The Company
presents value added taxes (“VAT”) as reductions of revenues. The Company recognizes revenues net of value added taxes (“VAT”)
and relevant charges.
We
generate revenue primarily from the sales of beverages directly to agents, wholesalers and end users. We recognize product revenue at
a point in time when the control of the products has been transferred to customers. The transfer of control is considered complete when
products have been picked up by or delivered to our customers. We account for packaging, shipping and handling fees as a fulfillment
cost.

Contract
liabilities
Contract
liabilities consist mainly of advances from customers. On certain occasions, the Company may receive prepayments from downstream
retailers or wholesales customers for wines prior to them taking possession of the Company’s products. The Company records these
receipts as customer advances until the control of the products has been transferred the customers. As of September 30, 2022 and December
31, 2021, the Company had customer advances of $ 442,556  and
nil,
0
respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $ 237,382  and
nil, respectively, of customer advances in the opening balance.
Value-added
taxes
Revenue
is recognized net of value-added taxes (“VAT”). The VAT is based on gross sales price and VAT rates applicable to the Company
is 3% for the period from the beginning of July 2019 till the end of February 2020, then changed to 1% from the beginning of 2020
till the end of September 2022. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers against
their output VAT liabilities. Net VAT balance between input VAT and output VAT is recorded as VAT payable if output VAT is larger than
input VAT and is recorded as VAT recoverable if input VAT is larger than output VAT. For entities that are VAT small taxpayers, VAT rate
applicable is 3% for the period from the beginning of July 2019, then during the COVID-19, the small taxpayers are allowed to enjoy
the preferred tax policy, tax rate from 3% to 1% for the period from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. All of the VAT returns
filed by the Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC, have been and remain subject to examination by the PRC tax authorities for five
years from the date of filing. VAT payables are included in accrued liabilities.
Income
Taxes
The
Company follows FASB ASC Subtopic 740, Income Taxes, for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted
marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
Deferred
income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggests that it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to
reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance
are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
Stock-based
Compensation
The
Company follows FASB ASC Subtopic 718, Stock Compensation, for accounting for stock-based compensation. The guidance requires that new,
modified and unvested share-based payment transactions with employees, such as grants of stock options and restricted stock, be recognized
in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair value at the grant date and recognized as compensation expense over their
vesting periods. The Company also follows the guidance for equity instruments issued to consultants.
Earnings
(loss) per Share
The
Company computes earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per share”. Basic
EPS is measured as the income or loss available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g.,
convertible securities, options, and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date,
if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share)
are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.
Related
party transactions
Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related
party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations
can be substantiated.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
There
are no recent accounting pronouncements that impact the Company’s operations.

GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had accumulated losses of $ 3,539,237 , and working capital deficit of
$ 638,889
as of September 30, 2022. These conditions among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the undertaking of its shareholders to provide continuing financial
support to enable the Company to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due.

As

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our Certifying Officer
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2022. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
3
Material
Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of September 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) lack of a functioning audit committee due to
a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent
with control objectives; and (iii) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Because a material
weakness in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting existed as of September 30, 2022 and has not been remediated,
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2022.
In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to initiate,
the following series of measures in connection with identifying an operating business to acquire and when funds are available to us:
1.
We
plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who would be appointed to an audit committee resulting in
a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
and procedures.
2.
We
plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise within the accounting function.
3.
We
plan to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our
books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions, including equity and debt transactions.
We
anticipate that we will, at least partially, begin to implement these initiatives in the current fiscal year.
This
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting and none is required.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
As
of the end of the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
