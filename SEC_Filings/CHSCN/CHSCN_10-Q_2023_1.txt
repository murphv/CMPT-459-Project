FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS     This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, and our other publicly available documents may contain, and our officers, directors and other representatives may from time to time make "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "goal," "seek," "believe," "project," "estimate," "expect," "strategy," "future," "likely," "may," "should," "will" and similar references to future periods. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our businesses, financial condition and results of operations, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements are discussed or identified in our public filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the "Risk Factors" discussion in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. These factors may include changes in commodity prices; the impact of government policies, mandates, regulations and trade agreements; global and regional political, economic, legal and other risks of doing business globally; the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine; the impact of inflation; the impact of epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of disease and other adverse public health developments, including COVID-19; the impact of market acceptance of alternatives to refined petroleum products; consolidation among our suppliers and customers; nonperformance by contractual counterparties; changes in federal income tax laws or our tax status; the impact of compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations; the impact of any governmental investigations; the impact of environmental liabilities and litigation; actual or perceived quality, safety or health risks associated with our products; the impact of seasonality; the effectiveness of our risk management strategies; business interruptions, casualty losses and supply chain issues; the impact of workforce factors; our funding needs and financing sources; financial institutions' and other capital sources' policies concerning energy-related businesses; uncertainty regarding the transition away from LIBOR and the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; technological improvements that decrease the demand for our agronomy and energy products; our ability to complete, integrate and benefit from acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and other nonordinary course-of-business events; security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems or assets; the impact of our environmental, social and governance practices, including failures or delays in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change or other environmental matters; the impairment of long-lived assets; and other factors affecting our businesses generally. Any forward-looking statements made by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based only on information currently available to us and speak only as of the date on which the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. 1 Table of Contents PART I.

(Unaudited) Note 1         Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations and cash flows for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year because of the seasonal nature of our businesses, among other things. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by the requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended August 31, 2022, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
Significant Accounting Policies
No significant accounting policies were updated or changed since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements     No recent accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Note 2         Revenues      The following table presents revenues recognized under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
("ASC Topic 606"), disaggregated by reportable segment, as well as the amount of revenues recognized under ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging
("ASC Topic 815"), and other applicable accounting guidance for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. Other applicable accounting guidance primarily includes revenues recognized under ASC Topic 470,
Debt , and ASC Topic 842,
Leases , that fall outside the scope of ASC Topic 606. ASC Topic 606 ASC Topic 815 Other Guidance Total Revenues Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Energy $ 2,802,155   $ 317,151   $ —   $ 3,119,306   Ag 2,613,460   7,009,353   10,431   9,633,244   Corporate and Other 5,699   —   7,590   13,289   Total revenues $ 5,421,314   $ 7,326,504   $ 18,021   $ 12,765,839   Three Months Ended November 30, 2021 Energy $ 2,047,277   $ 256,710   $ —   $ 2,303,987   Ag 2,531,956   6,029,260   8,043   8,569,259   Corporate and Other 3,590   —   3,921   7,511   Total revenues $ 4,582,823   $ 6,285,970   $ 11,964   $ 10,880,757   Less than 1% of revenues accounted for under ASC Topic 606 included within the tables above are recorded over time and relate primarily to service contracts. Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities     Contract assets relate to unbilled amounts arising from goods that have already been transferred to the customer where the right to payment is not conditional on the passage of time. This results in recognition of an asset, as the amount of revenue recognized at a certain point in time exceeds the amount billed to customers. Contract assets are recorded in receivables within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $ 17.0
million and $ 17.2
million as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, respectively. 6 Table of Contents Contract liabilities relate to advance payments received from customers for goods and services that we have yet to provide. Contract liabilities of $ 367.1
million and $ 541.5
million as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, respectively, are recorded within other current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenues of $ 122.0
million and $ 107.2
million related to contract liabilities, respectively. These amounts were included in the other current liabilities balance at the beginning of the respective period. Note 3         Receivables November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Trade accounts receivable $ 3,359,600   $ 2,626,623   CHS Capital short-term notes receivable 587,917   644,875   Other 459,462   404,734   Gross receivables 4,406,979   3,676,232   Less: allowances and reserves 130,336   127,917   Total receivables $ 4,276,643   $ 3,548,315            Receivables are composed of trade accounts receivable, short-term notes receivable in our wholly-owned subsidiary, CHS Capital, LLC ("CHS Capital"), and other receivables, less an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance for expected credit losses is based on our best estimate of expected credit losses in existing receivable balances and is determined using historical write-off experience, adjusted for various industry and regional data and current expectations of future credit losses. Notes receivable from commercial borrowers are collateralized by various combinations of mortgages, personal property, accounts and notes receivable, inventories and assignments of certain regional cooperatives' capital stock. These loans are primarily originated in the states of Minnesota and North Dakota. CHS Capital also has loans receivable from producer borrowers that are collateralized by various combinations of growing crops, livestock, inventories, accounts receivable, personal property and supplemental mortgages and are primarily originated in the same states as the commercial notes, as well as South Dakota.     In addition to the short-term balances included in the table above, CHS Capital had long-term notes receivable, with durations of generally not more than
10
years, totaling $ 75.7
million and $ 54.3
million as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, respectively. The long-term notes receivable are included in other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, commercial notes represented
37 % and
25 %, respectively, and producer notes represented
63 % and
75 %, respectively, of total CHS Capital notes receivable.
CHS Capital has commitments to extend credit to customers if there are no violations of any contractually established conditions. As of November 30, 2022, CHS Capital customers had additional available credit of $ 1.0
billion. No significant troubled debt restructuring activity occurred and no third-party customer or borrower accounted for more than 10% of the total receivables balance as of
November 30, 2022 , or August 31, 2022. Note 4         Inventories          November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Grain and oilseed $ 2,244,788   $ 1,133,531   Energy 918,042   824,114   Agronomy 1,482,707   1,295,548   Processed grain and oilseed 316,490   292,992   Other 108,077   106,686   Total inventories $ 5,070,104   $ 3,652,871       As of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, we valued approximately
12 % and
14 %, respectively, of inventories, primarily crude oil and refined fuels within our Energy segment, using the lower of cost, determined on the last in, first out ("LIFO") method, or net realizable value. If the first in, first out ("FIFO") method of accounting had been used, inventories
7 Table of Contents would have been higher than the reported amount by $ 515.9
million and $ 678.3
million as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, respectively. Actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time. Interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and values and are subject to final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
Note 5         Investments November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022   (Dollars in thousands) Equity method investments: CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC $ 2,769,170   $ 2,641,604   Ventura Foods, LLC 427,343   410,093   Ardent Mills, LLC 255,106   250,857   TEMCO, LLC 44,091   32,809   Other equity method investments 268,731   265,913   Other investments 126,183   126,730   Total investments $ 3,890,624   $ 3,728,006       Joint ventures and other investments in which we have significant ownership and influence, but not control, are accounted for in our condensed consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Our only significant equity method investment during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, was CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC ("CF Nitrogen"), which is summarized below. In addition to recognition of our share of income from equity method investments, our equity method investments are evaluated for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on an ongoing basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). Other investments consist primarily of investments in cooperatives without readily determinable fair values and are generally recorded at cost, unless an impairment or other observable market price change occurs requiring an adjustment. We have approximately $ 680.1  million of cumulative undistributed earnings from our equity method investees included in the investments balance as of
November 30, 2022 . CF Nitrogen     We have a $ 2.8
billion investment in CF Nitrogen, a strategic venture with CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ("CF Industries"). The investment consists of an approximate
8 % membership interest (based on product tons) in CF Nitrogen. We account for this investment using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method, recognizing our share of the earnings and losses of CF Nitrogen as equity income from investments in our Nitrogen Production segment based on our contractual claims on the entity's net assets pursuant to the liquidation provisions of CF Nitrogen's Limited Liability Company Agreement, adjusted for semiannual cash distributions.
The following table provides summarized unaudited financial information for our equity method investment in CF Nitrogen for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 1,623,268   $ 1,316,899   Gross profit 770,478   575,571   Net earnings 764,179   562,593   Earnings attributable to CHS Inc. 127,566   116,473            Our investments in other equity method investees are not significant in relation to our condensed consolidated financial statements, either individually or in aggregate. 8 Table of Contents Note 6        Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt Our notes payable and long-term debt are subject to various restrictive requirements for maintenance of minimum consolidated net worth and other financial ratios. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of
November 30, 2022 . Notes payable as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, consisted of the following: November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Notes payable $ 625,872   $ 459,398   CHS Capital notes payable 147,575   147,321   Total notes payable $ 773,447   $ 606,719            Our primary line of credit is a
five -year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of domestic and international banks. The credit facility provides a committed amount of $ 2.75
billion that expires on July 16, 2024. There were
no
borrowings outstanding on this facility as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022. We also maintain certain uncommitted bilateral facilities to support our working capital needs.     We have a receivables and loans securitization facility ("Securitization Facility") with certain unaffiliated financial institutions ("Purchasers"). Under the Securitization Facility, we and certain of our subsidiaries ("Originators") sell trade accounts and notes receivable ("Receivables") to Cofina Funding, LLC ("Cofina"), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, indirect subsidiary of CHS. Cofina in turn transfers the Receivables to the Purchasers, and this arrangement is accounted for as secured financing. We use the proceeds from the sale of Receivables under the Securitization Facility for general corporate purposes and settlements are made on a monthly basis. The amount available under the Securitization Facility fluctuates over time, based on the total amount of eligible Receivables generated during the normal course of business. The Securitization Facility consists of a committed portion with a maximum availability of $ 850.0
million and an uncommitted portion with a maximum availability of $ 250.0
million. As of  November 30, 2022 , total availability under the Securitization Facility was $ 929.0
million, of which no amount was utilized.     We also have a repurchase facility ("Repurchase Facility") related to the Securitization Facility. Under the Repurchase Facility, we can obtain repurchase agreement financing in an amount up to $ 150.0
million for subordinated notes issued by Cofina in favor of the Originators and representing a portion of the outstanding balance of the Receivables sold by the Originators to Cofina under the Securitization Facility.
No
balance was outstanding under the Repurchase Facility as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022.
The following table presents summarized long-term debt (including current portion) as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022:
November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022   (Dollars in thousands) Private placement debt $ 1,545,000   $ 1,545,000   Term loan 366,000   366,000   Finance lease obligations 45,069   44,773   Deferred financing costs ( 3,399 ) ( 3,535 ) Other 5,376   6,576   Total long-term debt 1,958,046   1,958,814   Less current portion 289,888   290,605   Long-term portion $ 1,668,158   $ 1,668,209   Interest expense for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, was $ 33.3
million and $ 23.4
million, respectively, net of capitalized interest of $ 2.5
million and $ 2.3  million, respectively.
9 Table of Contents Note 7        Income Taxes      Our effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2022, was
4.2 %, compared to
3.2 % for the three months ended November 30, 2021. Our income tax expense reflects the mix of full-year earnings projected across business units and current equity management assumptions. Income taxes and effective tax rates vary each year based on profitability and nonpatronage business activity during the year.     Our uncertain tax positions are affected by the tax years that are under audit or remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Reserves are recorded against unrecognized tax benefits when we believe certain fully supportable tax return positions are likely to be challenged, and we may not prevail. If we were to prevail on all positions taken in relation to uncertain tax positions, $ 115.3
million and $ 115.1
million of the unrecognized tax benefits would ultimately benefit our effective tax rate as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months.

Pension and other postretirement reclassifications include amortization of net actuarial loss, prior service credit and transition amounts and are recorded as cost of goods sold and marketing, general and administrative expenses (see Note 9,
Benefit Plans , for further information). As described in Note 11,
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities , amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for cash flow hedges are recorded as cost of goods sold. Gains or losses on foreign currency translation reclassifications are recorded as other income. 11 Table of Contents Note 9         Benefit Plans     We have various pension and other defined benefit and defined contribution plans, in which substantially all employees may participate. We also have nonqualified supplemental executive and Board of Directors retirement plans.      Components of net periodic benefit costs for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, are as follows:

No contributions were made to the pension plans during the three months ended November 30, 2022, and we do not currently anticipate being required to make contributions for our pension plans in fiscal 2023, although we may voluntarily elect to do so. Note 10         Segment Reporting     We are an integrated agricultural cooperative, providing grain, foods and energy resources to businesses and consumers on a global basis. We provide a wide variety of products and services, from initial agricultural inputs such as fuels, farm supplies, crop nutrients and crop protection products, to agricultural outputs that include grain and oilseed, processed grain and oilseed, renewable fuels and food products. We define our operating segments in accordance with ASC Topic 280,
Segment Reporting , to reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance and allocates resources in managing the business. We have aggregated those operating segments into three reportable segments: Energy, Ag and Nitrogen Production.     Our Energy segment produces and provides primarily for the wholesale distribution of petroleum products and transportation of those products. Our Ag segment purchases and further processes or resells grain and oilseed originated by our country operations business, by our member cooperatives and by third parties; serves as a wholesaler and retailer of crop inputs; and produces and markets ethanol. Our Nitrogen Production segment consists of our equity method investment in CF Nitrogen and allocated expenses. Our supply agreement with CF Nitrogen entitles us to purchase up to a specified quantity of granular urea and urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN") annually from CF Nitrogen. Corporate and Other represents our financing and hedging businesses, which primarily consist of financial services related to crop production and a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated futures commission merchant ("FCM") for commodities hedging. Our nonconsolidated investments in Ventura Foods, LLC ("Ventura Foods"), and Ardent Mills, LLC ("Ardent Mills"), are also included in our Corporate and Other category.      Corporate administrative expenses and interest are allocated to each reportable segment and Corporate and Other, based on direct use of services, such as information technology and legal, and other factors or considerations relevant to the costs incurred.     Many of our business activities are highly seasonal and our operating results vary throughout the year. Our revenues generally trend lower during the second fiscal quarter; however, our income before income taxes does not necessarily follow the same trend due to weather and other events that can impact profitability. For example, in our Ag segment, our country operations business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the fall harvest and spring planting seasons, which generally correspond to our first and third fiscal quarters, respectively. Additionally, our agronomy business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the spring planting season. Our global grain and processing operations are subject to fluctuations in volume and revenues based on producer harvests, world grain prices, demand and international trade relationships. Our Energy segment generally experiences higher volumes and revenues in certain operating areas, such as
12 Table of Contents refined products, in the spring, summer and early fall when gasoline and diesel fuel use by agricultural producers is highest and is subject to global supply and demand forces. Other energy products, such as propane, generally experience higher volumes and revenues during the winter heating and fall crop-drying seasons.
Our revenues, assets and cash flows can be significantly affected by global market prices for commodities such as petroleum products, natural gas, grain, oilseed, crop nutrients and flour. Changes in market prices for commodities that we purchase without a corresponding change in the selling prices of those products can affect revenues and operating earnings. Commodity prices are affected by a wide range of factors beyond our control, including weather, crop damage due to plant disease or insects, drought, availability and adequacy of supply, availability of reliable rail and river transportation networks, outbreaks of disease, government regulations and policies, global trade disputes, wars and civil unrest, and general political and economic conditions.     While our revenues and operating results are derived primarily from businesses and operations that are wholly-owned or subsidiaries and limited liability companies in which we have a controlling interest, a portion of our business operations is conducted through companies in which we hold ownership interests of 50% or less or otherwise do not control the operations. We account for these investments primarily using the equity method of accounting, wherein we record our proportionate share of income or loss reported by the entity as equity income from investments, without consolidating the revenues and expenses of the entity in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In our Ag segment, this includes our
50 % interest in TEMCO. In our Nitrogen Production segment, this consists of our approximate
8 % membership interest (based on product tons) in CF Nitrogen. In Corporate and Other, this principally includes our
50 % ownership in Ventura Foods and our
12 % ownership in Ardent Mills. See Note 5,
Investments,
for more information related to our equity method investments.     Reconciling amounts represent the elimination of revenues between segments. Such transactions are executed at market prices to more accurately evaluate the profitability of the individual business segments. Segment information for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, is presented in the tables below:

Except for certain cash-settled swaps related to future crude oil purchases and refined product sales, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges, our derivative instruments represent economic hedges of price risk for which hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815 is not applied. Rather, the derivative instruments are recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with
13 Table of Contents changes in fair value being recorded directly to earnings, primarily within cost of goods sold in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 12,
Fair Value Measurements,
for additional information. The majority of our exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily through CHS Hedging, LLC, our wholly-owned FCM. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The majority of our derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments. The following tables present the gross fair values of derivative assets, derivative liabilities and margin deposits (cash collateral) recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, along with related amounts permitted to be offset in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Although we have certain netting arrangements for our exchange-traded futures and options contracts and certain over-the-counter ("OTC") contracts, we have elected to report our derivative instruments on a gross basis on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets under ASC Topic 210-20,

Derivative assets and liabilities with maturities greater than 12 months are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of long-term derivative assets recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, was $ 4.7
million and $ 8.5
million, respectively. The amount of long-term derivative liabilities recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, was $ 2.4
million and $ 4.0

The table below presents the notional volumes for
all outstanding commodity contracts:

We use foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Although we have some risk exposure relating to foreign currency transactions, a larger impact with exchange rate fluctuations is the ability of foreign buyers to purchase U.S. agricultural products and the competitiveness of U.S. agricultural products compared to the same products offered by alternative sources of world supply. The notional amount of our foreign exchange derivative contracts was $ 1.6
billion and $ 1.9
billion as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, respectively. Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Strategies     Certain pay-fixed, receive-variable, cash-settled swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of future crude oil purchases in our Energy segment. We also designate certain pay-variable, receive-fixed, cash-settled swaps as cash flow hedges of future refined energy product sales. These hedging instruments and the related hedged items are exposed to significant market price risk and potential volatility. As part of our risk management strategy, we look to hedge a portion of our expected future crude oil needs and the resulting refined product output based on prevailing futures prices, management's expectations about future commodity price changes and our risk appetite. We may also elect to dedesignate certain derivative instruments previously designated as cash flow hedges as part of our risk management strategy. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income for these dedesignated derivative instruments remain in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings in the period in which the underlying transactions affect earnings. As of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, the aggregate notional amounts of cash flow hedges were
3.1
million and
3.8
million barrels, respectively.

Fair Value Measurement,
defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction among the market participants on the measurement date.
We determine fair values of derivative instruments and certain other assets based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC Topic 820, which requires an entity to maximize use of observable inputs and minimize use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC Topic 820 describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity for the assets or liabilities. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. 16 Table of Contents     Recurring fair value measurements as of
November 30, 2022 , and August 31, 2022, are as follows: November 30, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total (Dollars in thousands) Assets         Commodity derivatives $ 702   $ 326,932   $ —   $ 327,634   Foreign exchange derivatives —   51,509   —   51,509   Deferred compensation assets 48,430   —   —   48,430   Segregated investments and marketable securities 207,521   —   —   207,521   Other assets 85,457   —   —   85,457   Total $ 342,110   $ 378,441   $ —   $ 720,551   Liabilities         Commodity derivatives $ 2,894   $ 249,347   $ —   $ 252,241   Foreign exchange derivatives —   13,937   —   13,937   Total $ 2,894   $ 263,284   $ —   $ 266,178   August 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total (Dollars in thousands) Assets Commodity derivatives $ 1,161   $ 490,160   $ —   $ 491,321   Foreign exchange derivatives —   52,923   —   52,923   Deferred compensation assets 46,562   —   —   46,562   Segregated investments and marketable securities 238,124   —   —   238,124   Other assets 11,718   —   —   11,718   Total $ 297,565   $ 543,083   $ —   $ 840,648   Liabilities Commodity derivatives $ 10,256   $ 379,883   $ —   $ 390,139   Foreign exchange derivatives —   12,649   —   12,649   Total $ 10,256   $ 392,532   $ —   $ 402,788       Commodity and foreign exchange derivatives . Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. Our forward commodity purchase and sales contracts with fixed-price components, select ocean freight contracts and other OTC derivatives are determined using inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices and/or recent market bids and offers, including location-specific adjustments, and are classified within Level 2. Location-specific inputs are driven by local market supply and demand and are generally based on broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or OTC markets.

Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: • Overview • Business Strategy • Fiscal 2023 First Quarter Highlights • Fiscal 2023 Trends Update • Operating Metrics • Results of Operations • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Critical Accounting Policies • Recent Accounting Pronouncements     Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022 (including the information presented therein under Risk Factors), as well as the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview     CHS Inc. ("CHS") is a diversified company that provides grain, food, agronomy and energy resources to businesses and consumers on a global scale. As a cooperative, we are owned by farmers, ranchers and member cooperatives across the United States. We also have preferred shareholders who own our five series of preferred stock, all of which are listed and traded on the Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. We operate in the following three reportable segments: • Energy . Produces and provides primarily for the wholesale distribution and transportation of petroleum products. • Ag . Purchases and further processes or resells grain and oilseed originated by our country operations and global grain and processing businesses, by our member cooperatives and by third parties. It also includes our renewable fuels business and serves as a wholesaler and retailer of agronomy products. • Nitrogen Production . Produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer. It consists of our equity method investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC ("CF Nitrogen"), and allocated expenses.     In addition, our financing and hedging businesses, along with our nonconsolidated food production and distribution and wheat milling joint ventures, have been aggregated within our Corporate and Other category.          The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CHS and all subsidiaries and limited liability companies in which we have a controlling interest. The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.     Corporate administrative expenses and interest are allocated to each reporting segment and Corporate and Other, based on direct use of services, such as information technology and legal, and other factors or considerations relevant to the costs incurred.      Management's Focus .
When evaluating our operating performance, management focuses on gross profit and income before income taxes ("IBIT"). As a company that operates heavily in global commodities, there is significant unpredictability and volatility in pricing, costs and global trade volumes. Consequently, we focus on managing the margin we can earn and the resulting IBIT. We also focus on ensuring balance sheet strength through appropriate management of financial liquidity, leverage, capital allocation and cash flow optimization.
Seasonality .
Many of our business activities are highly seasonal and our operating results vary throughout the year. Our revenues generally trend lower during the second fiscal quarter; however, our IBIT does not necessarily follow the same trend due to weather and other events that can impact profitability. For example, in our Ag segment, our country operations business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the fall harvest and spring planting seasons, which generally correspond to our first and third fiscal quarters, respectively. Additionally, our agronomy business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the spring planting season. Our global grain and processing operations are
19 Table of Contents subject to fluctuations in volumes and revenues based on producer harvests, world grain prices, demand and international trade relationships. Our Energy segment generally experiences higher volumes and revenues in certain operating areas, such as refined products, in the spring, summer and early fall when gasoline and diesel fuel use by agricultural producers is highest and is subject to global supply and demand forces. Other energy products, such as propane, generally experience higher volumes and revenues during the winter heating and fall crop-drying seasons. The graphs below depict the seasonality inherent in our businesses:
Pricing and Volumes .
Our revenues, assets and cash flows can be significantly affected by global market prices and sales volumes of commodities such as petroleum products, natural gas, grain, oilseed products and agronomy products. Changes in market prices for commodities we purchase without a corresponding change in the selling prices of those products can affect revenues and operating earnings. Similarly, increased or decreased sales volumes without a corresponding change in the purchase and selling prices of those products can affect revenues and operating earnings. Commodity prices and sales volumes are affected by a wide range of factors beyond our control, including weather, crop damage due to plant disease or insects, drought, availability/adequacy of supply of a commodity, availability of reliable rail and river transportation networks, disease outbreaks, government regulations and policies, global trade disputes, wars and civil unrest, and general political and/or economic conditions. 20 Table of Contents Business Strategy     Our business strategies focus on an enterprisewide effort to create an experience that empowers customers to make CHS their first choice, expand market access to add value for our owners and transform and evolve our core businesses by capitalizing on changing market dynamics. To execute these strategies, we are focused on implementing agile, efficient and sustainable technology platforms; building robust and efficient supply chains; hiring, developing and retaining high-performing, diverse and passionate teams; achieving operational excellence and continuous improvement; and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Fiscal 2023 First Quarter Highlights • Continued robust global demand, coupled with increased market volatility, resulted in elevated commodity prices and strong earnings. • Higher refining margins drove significantly improved earnings in our Energy segment that resulted from supply and demand factors, including trade flow disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and higher global demand for energy products as consumption outpaced supply. • Our processing business in our Ag segment benefited from strong meal and oil demand. • Equity method investments continue to perform well, with our CF Nitrogen investment being the largest contributor. The CF Nitrogen investment delivered improved earnings as a result of market conditions driven by strong global demand for urea and urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN"). Fiscal 2023 Trends Update Our segments operate in cyclical environments in which market conditions can change rapidly with significant positive or negative impacts on our results. We anticipate that various macroeconomic factors, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, rising interest rates, and inflationary pressures increasing costs of labor, freight and materials, will continue to drive uncertainty and instability in global energy and agricultural commodity markets, as well as global financial markets. This uncertainty and instability could have a significant impact on each of our segments throughout the remainder of fiscal 2023. In addition to these broad macroeconomic factors, the cost of renewable energy credits remains higher than historical levels, which could continue to negatively impact our profitability, and regional factors, such as unpredictable weather conditions, including those due to climate change, could impact demand for agricultural inputs and outputs, as well as our ability to supply those inputs and outputs. Although challenges remain, we currently expect the imbalance between global supply and strong global demand for agricultural commodities to result in continued market volatility and favorable pricing throughout the remainder of fiscal 2023. We are unable to predict how long the current environment and market conditions will last or the extent of the financial and operational impacts to us in fiscal 2023. Refer to Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022, for additional impacts that these and other risks may have on our business operations and financial performance. In addition to navigating market conditions that impact our businesses, we will continue to execute our enterprise priorities throughout fiscal 2023, including empowering and supporting our people, advancing our operating model by transforming how we work and adopting new technologies, and strategically investing in our infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of our owners and customers, enhancing value for the cooperative system and propelling sustainable growth. 21 Table of Contents Operating Metrics Energy     Our Energy segment operations primarily include our refineries in Laurel, Montana, and McPherson, Kansas, which process crude oil to produce refined products, including gasoline, distillates and other products. To ensure the reliability of our refineries, we perform major maintenance activities every two to five years, which require a temporary shutdown of operations. These planned shutdowns allow us to extend the life, increase the capacity and improve the safety and efficiency of our refinery processing assets. They also minimize unplanned business interruptions and are essential to the long-term reliability and profitability of our Energy segment. During periods of maintenance, utilization rates, throughput volumes and refined fuel yields are lower and we may purchase refined petroleum products from third parties to meet the needs of our customers. These third-party purchases may result in lower margins than for products produced by our refineries, which reduces our profitability. The following table provides information about our consolidated refinery operations: Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 2021 Refinery throughput volumes (Barrels per day) Heavy, high-sulfur crude oil 89,415  102,340  All other crude oil 71,271  70,327  Other feedstocks and blendstocks 10,708  18,338  Total refinery throughput volumes 171,394  191,005  Refined fuel yields Gasolines 76,014  92,886  Distillates 75,393  78,924  We are subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires refiners to blend renewable fuels (e.g., ethanol and biodiesel) into their finished transportation fuels or purchase renewable energy credits, known as renewable identification numbers ("RINs"), in lieu of blending. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") generally establishes new annual renewable fuel percentage standards for each compliance year in the preceding year. In June 2022, the EPA issued a final renewable volume obligation ("RVO") for calendar years 2020 through 2022. We generate RINs through our blending activities, but we cannot generate enough RINs to meet the needs of our refining capacity, and RINs must be purchased on the open market. The price of RINs can be volatile, which can positively or negatively impact our profitability. The prices for D6 ethanol RINs and D4 ethanol RINs during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year increased by 42% and 25%, respectively. Estimates of our RIN expenses are calculated using an average RIN price each month.
In addition to our internal operational reliability, the profitability of our Energy segment is largely driven by crack spreads (i.e., the price differential between refined products and inputs such as crude oil) and Western Canadian Select ("WCS") crude oil discounts (i.e., the price discount for WCS crude oil relative to West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil), which are driven by the supply and demand of refined products. Crack spreads and the WCS crude oil discounts both increased during the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same period during the prior year, contributing to improved IBIT for the Energy segment. The table below provides information about average market reference prices and discounts that impact our Energy segment:     Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 2021 Market indicators WTI crude oil (dollars per barrel) $ 85.15  $ 77.14  WTI - WCS crude oil discount (dollars per barrel) $ 25.16  $ 12.95  Group 3 2:1:1 crack spread (dollars per barrel)* $ 44.76  $ 18.04  Group 3 5:3:2 crack spread (dollars per barrel)* $ 40.40  $ 17.56  D6 ethanol RIN (dollars per RIN) $ 1.6733  $ 1.1760  D4 ethanol RIN (dollars per RIN) $ 1.8259  $ 1.4648  *Group 3 refers to the oil refining and distribution system serving Midwest markets from the Gulf Coast through the Plains states. 22 Table of Contents Ag     Our Ag segment operations work together to facilitate production, purchase, sale and eventual use of grain and other agricultural commodities within the United States and internationally. Profitability in our Ag segment is largely driven by throughput and production volumes, as well as commodity price spreads; however, revenues and cost of goods sold ("COGS") are largely affected by market-driven commodity prices that are outside our control. The table below provides information about average market prices for agricultural commodities and our sales/throughput volumes that impacted our Ag segment for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended November 30, Market Source* 2022 2021 Commodity prices Corn (dollars per bushel) Chicago Board of Trade $ 6.77  $ 5.57  Soybeans (dollars per bushel) Chicago Board of Trade $ 14.14  $ 12.36  Wheat (dollars per bushel) Chicago Board of Trade $ 8.58  $ 7.57  Urea (dollars per ton) Green Markets NOLA $ 589.27  $ 676.00  Urea ammonium nitrate (dollars per ton) Green Markets NOLA $ 540.16  $ 456.64  Ethanol (dollars per gallon) Chicago Platts $ 2.50  $ 2.81  Volumes Grain and oilseed (thousands of bushels) 517,439  564,112  North American grain and oilseed port throughput (thousands of bushels) 161,715  172,987  Wholesale crop nutrients (thousands of tons) 1,612  1,823  Ethanol (thousands of gallons) 243,761  224,246  *Market source information represents the average month-end price during the period. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 % of Revenues* 2021 % of Revenues* (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 12,765,839  100.0  % $ 10,880,757  100.0  % Cost of goods sold 11,886,704  93.1  10,360,849  95.2  Gross profit 879,135  6.9  519,908  4.8  Marketing, general and administrative expenses 234,666  1.8  204,934  1.9  Operating earnings 644,469  5.0  314,974  2.9  Interest expense 33,250  0.3  23,432  0.2  Other income (24,289) (0.2) (23,776) (0.2) Equity income from investments (181,962) (1.4) (151,345) (1.4) Income before income taxes 817,470  6.4  466,663  4.3  Income tax expense 34,554  0.3  14,720  0.1  Net income 782,916  6.1  451,943  4.2  Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 318  —  (18) —  Net income attributable to CHS Inc.  $ 782,598  6.1  % $ 451,961  4.2  % *Amounts less than 0.1% are shown as zero percent.

*See commentary related to these changes in the marketing, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, other income and equity income from investments sections of this Results of Operations. The change in Energy segment IBIT reflects the following: • Higher crack spreads and increased WCS crude oil discounts resulted from higher global demand and improved market conditions in our refined fuels business, which contributed to a $477.3 million increase of IBIT. • The increased IBIT was partially offset by increased costs in our refined fuels business, the most significant of which included $46.0 million related to higher RIN prices due to market conditions and $23.0 million of increased refinery expenses, including higher repairs and maintenance expenses resulting from planned and unplanned maintenance in the current year. • Decreased refined fuels production volumes due to planned and unplanned maintenance at refineries reduced the sales mix of higher-margin produced refined fuels compared to the prior year and also contributed to a $27.0 million decrease of IBIT. • Lower margins for propane primarily resulted from hedging-related impacts due to global market conditions affecting the price of propane contributed to a $21.0 million decrease of IBIT. 25 Table of Contents Ag Three Months Ended November 30, Change 2022 2021 Dollars Percent   (Dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes $ 287,299  $ 286,425  $ 874  0.3  %     The following waterfall analysis and commentary presents the changes in our Ag segment IBIT for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same period during the prior year:
*See commentary related to these changes in the marketing, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, other income and equity income from investments sections of this Results of Operations. The change in Ag segment IBIT reflects the following: • Increased margins of $68.4 million in our oilseed processing product category resulted from strong meal and oil demand during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. • Increased margins were partially offset by the net impact across our other product categories, including decreased margins for grain and oilseed as a result of mark-to-market changes associated with our commodity derivatives and wholesale agronomy which experienced less favorable pricing due to global market conditions. • Decreased volumes across all our Ag segment product categories resulted from a number of factors, including drought conditions experienced in portions of our trade territory that decreased crop yields.

Summary of Our Major Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents We fund our current operations primarily through our cash flows from operations and with short-term borrowings through our committed and uncommitted revolving credit facilities, including our securitization facility with certain unaffiliated financial institutions and our repurchase facility relating thereto. We fund certain of our long-term capital needs, primarily those related to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, with cash flows from operations and by issuing long-term debt. See Note 6,
Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt , of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We will continue to consider opportunities to further diversify and enhance our sources and amounts of liquidity.
Summary of Our Major Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents The following is a summary of our primary cash requirements for fiscal 2023: • Capital expenditures.
We expect total capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 to be approximately $869.1 million compared to capital expenditures of $354.4 million in fiscal 2022. Increased capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are for investments in our infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of our owners and customers, enhance value for the cooperative system and propel sustainable growth. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we acquired $122.6 million of property, plant and equipment. • Major maintenance.
We expect total major maintenance for fiscal 2023 to be approximately $249.5 million compared to major maintenance of $24.8 million in fiscal 2022. Increased major maintenance for fiscal 2023 is for major maintenance at our Laurel and McPherson refineries. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we paid $27.4 million in major maintenance.
• Debt and interest . We expect to repay approximately $291.7 million of long-term debt and finance lease obligations and incur interest payments related to long-term debt of approximately $92.0 million during fiscal 2023. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we repaid $3.1 million of scheduled long-term debt maturities and finance lease obligations. • Preferred stock dividends.
We had approximately $2.3 billion of preferred stock outstanding as of November 30, 2022. We expect to pay dividends on our preferred stock of approximately $168.7 million during fiscal 2023. Dividends paid on our preferred stock during the three months ended November 30, 2022, were $42.2 million.
• Patronage . Our Board of Directors has authorized approximately $500.0 million of our fiscal 2022 patronage-sourced earnings to be paid to our member-owners during fiscal 2023.
• Equity redemptions . Our Board of Directors has authorized equity redemptions of up to $500.0 million to be distributed in fiscal 2023 in the form of redemptions of qualified and nonqualified equity owned by individual producer-members and association members. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we redeemed $12.9 million of member equity.
We believe cash generated by operating and investing activities, along with available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to support our short- and long-term operations. Our notes payable and long-term debt are subject to various restrictive requirements for maintenance of minimum consolidated net worth and other financial ratios. We
32 Table of Contents were in compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions as of November 30, 2022. Based on our current fiscal 2023 projections, we expect continued covenant compliance.
Working Capital      We measure working capital as current assets less current liabilities as each amount appears on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe this information is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Working capital as of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, was as follows: November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 Change   (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 11,464,635  $ 9,377,847  $ 2,086,788  Less current liabilities 8,488,242  6,951,969  1,536,273  Working capital
$ 2,976,393  $ 2,425,878  $ 550,515  As of November 30, 2022, working capital increased by $550.5 million compared with August 31, 2022. Current asset balance changes increased working capital by $2.1 billion, primarily driven by increases in inventories and receivables, which were driven by the fall harvest. Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1.5 billion, primarily due to increases in accounts payable, which was also driven by the fall harvest. We finance our working capital needs through committed and uncommitted lines of credit with domestic and international banks. We believe our current cash balances and available capacity on our committed and uncommitted lines of credit will provide adequate liquidity to meet our working capital needs. Contractual Obligations For information regarding our estimated contractual obligations, see the MD&A discussion included in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. Cash Flows
The following table presents summarized cash flow data for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 2021 Change   (Dollars in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities $ (180,192) $ (183,587) $ 3,395  Net cash used in investing activities (110,713) (52,196) (58,517) Net cash provided by financing activities 129,960  156,002  (26,042) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1,415  (3,550) 4,965  Decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (159,530) $ (83,331) $ (76,199)     Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including seasonality and timing differences associated with purchases, sales, taxes and other business decisions. The $3.4 million decrease in cash used in operating activities primarily reflects increased net income during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period during fiscal 2022, which was partially offset by the increase in net working capital during the same period.     The $58.5 million increase in cash used in investing activities primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of a business in the prior year that did not occur in the current year and increased expenditures for property, plant and equipment during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to the same period during fiscal 2022.     The $26.0 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects increases in our outstanding drafts for grain checks from harvest and higher commodity prices. 33 Table of Contents Preferred Stock              The following is a summary of our outstanding preferred stock as of November 30, 2022, all shares of which are listed on the Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC: Nasdaq Symbol Issuance Date Shares Outstanding Redemption Value Net Proceeds (a) Dividend Rate  (b) (c) Dividend Payment Frequency Redeemable Beginning (d) (Dollars in millions) 8% Cumulative Redeemable CHSCP (e) 12,272,003  $ 306.8  $ 311.2  8.00  % Quarterly 7/18/2023 Class B Cumulative Redeemable, Series 1 CHSCO (f) 21,459,066  $ 536.5  $ 569.3  7.875  % Quarterly 9/26/2023 Class B Reset Rate Cumulative Redeemable, Series 2 CHSCN 3/11/2014 16,800,000  $ 420.0  $ 406.2  7.10  % Quarterly 3/31/2024 Class B Reset Rate Cumulative Redeemable, Series 3 CHSCM 9/15/2014 19,700,000  $ 492.5  $ 476.7  6.75  % Quarterly 9/30/2024 Class B Cumulative Redeemable, Series 4 CHSCL 1/21/2015 20,700,000  $ 517.5  $ 501.0  7.50  % Quarterly 1/21/2025 (a) Includes patron equities redeemed with preferred stock.
