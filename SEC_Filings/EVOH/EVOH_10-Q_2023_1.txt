NOTE

GOING CONCERN
The
Company’s financial statements as of November 30, 2022, is prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not
established a sustainable ongoing source of
revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.
As
of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 8,838,700
and
$ 7,465,373
respectively.
The Company incurred net loss of $ 1,440,362
and
$ 383,332
for
three months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, respectively. The cash used in operating activities were $ 264,216
and
$ 159,933
for
the three months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, respectively. It was brought to the attention of the Management to
assess going concern considering all facts and circumstances about the foreseeable future of the Company as well as its assets and
liabilities on the basis that it will be able to realize and discharge them in the normal course of business.
With
the injection of a viable business into the Company (“New Business”) contemplated under the Transaction (defined in Note
1), the Management believes that the actions to be taken by the Management to further implement the business plans for the New Business
including expansion in product offerings, geographical expansion, generate revenue through expansion of revenue streams and customer
base (retail, commercial and industrial as well as private label and licensing clientele), improvement of profitability by achieving
economies of scale provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company is also working on
raising additional funding to finance the operations as well as business expansion.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly financial
statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared by the Group in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for financial
information and pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EvoAir
International, WKL Eco Earth Holdings and its subsidiaries namely (i)
100 % owned WKL Eco Earth, (ii)
100 % owned WKL Green Energy, (iii)
67.5 % owned EvoAir Manufacturing (which includes its wholly owned subsidiary Evo Air Marketing), (iv)
55 % owned WKL EcoEarth Indochina,
and (v)
55 % owned WKL Guanzhe.
As
WKL Eco Earth and WKL Green Energy were under common control at the time of the Transaction, it is required under U.S. GAAP to
account for this common control acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Under this method
of accounting, EVOH’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, reflect WKL Eco
Earth and WKL Green Energy on a historical carryover basis in the assets and liabilities instead of reflecting the fair market value
of the assets and liabilities.
All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. In the opinion of the Management, the accompanying financial
statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly all financial statements
in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The
non-controlling interests are presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, separately from equity attributable
to the stockholders of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Company are presented on the face of the
condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as an allocation of the total loss for the year between
non-controlling interest holders and the stockholders of the Company.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Key estimates in the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include,
inter-alia , revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful
accounts and product returns, provisions for obsolete inventory, valuation of long-lived assets and Rights of Use
(“ROU”) assets (including lease liabilities), and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Actual results could
differ materially from these estimates.
Fiscal
Year End
The
Company operates on a fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending on August 31.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company places its
cash with a high credit quality financial institution.
WKL
Guanzhe’s business is primarily conducted in China and substantially
all of its revenue is denominated in Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”). The government of People’s Republic of China (“PRC”)
imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of RMB into foreign exchange and
through restrictions on foreign trade.
Comprehensive
Gain or Loss
ASC
220 “Comprehensive Income,” establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
in the financial statements. As of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, the Company established that there are items that represented
components of comprehensive income and, therefore, has included a statement of comprehensive income/loss in the financial statements.
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
functional currency of Chinese operations is RMB. The functional currency
of the Company’s Singapore operations is Singapore dollars (“SGD”). The functional currency of the Company’s Malaysia
operations is Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”). The Management has adopted ASC 830 “Foreign Currency Matters” for transactions
that occur in foreign currencies. Monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing
at the balance sheet date. Average monthly rates are used to translate revenue and expenses.
9
| Page
Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
on the dates of the transaction. Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination
of net income for the respective periods.
Assets
and liabilities of the Company’s operations are translated into the reporting currency, United States Dollars (“US$”),
at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the
reporting periods. Equity transactions are recorded at the historical rate when the transaction occurred. The resulting translation adjustment
is reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss, a separate component of shareholders’ equity in the statement of changes
in equity/deficit.
Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts
receivable are recorded at the net value of face amount less any allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts
is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. An allowance for doubtful
accounts is recorded in the period when loss is probable based on an assessment of specific evidence indicating troubled collection,
historical experience, accounts aging and other factors. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis,
and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability. An account receivable is written off after all collection effort
has ceased. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received. Interest is not charged on past due accounts.
As
of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, our accounts receivable amounted to $ 67,657
and $ 85,960 ,
respectively, with no allowance for doubtful accounts for both periods.
Inventories
Inventories
consist primarily of finished goods, raw materials, and work-in-process (“WIP”) from WKL Eco Earth, WKL EcoEarth Indochina,
WKL Guanzhe, and EvoAir Manufacturing.
We
value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the standard cost method, which
approximates actual cost based on a first-in, first-out method. All other costs, including administrative costs, are expensed as incurred.
Deposit, Prepayments and Other Receivables
Deposit,
prepayments and other receivables are comprised of prepayments paid to vendors to initiate orders and prepaid services fees and are classified
as current assets if such amounts are to be recognized within one year from the balance sheet date.
Property,
Plant and Equipment
Property,
plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the related capitalized assets.
Property,
plant and equipment are depreciated over 5 to 10 years .
SUMMARY OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS
Useful lives
Plant and machineries
5 years
Office equipment
5 years
Vehicles
5 years
Furniture and equipment
10 years
Renovation
10 years
Repair
and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. At the time of retirement or other disposition of property, plant and equipment,
the cost and accumulated depreciation will be removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, will be reflected in
operations.
Intangible
Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
The
Company’s intangible assets consist of patents and trademarks related to assignments of intellectual properties by Dr. Low into
WKL Eco Earth Holdings under the IP Assignments as contemplated in Note 1. The intangible assets are recorded at fair market value and
are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated life of
20 years
for both patents and trademarks.
Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
to generate. If identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the
carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value.

Revenue
Recognition
Revenue
is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration
that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature,
amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company does not disaggregate its
revenue streams as the economic factors underlying the contracts are similar and provide no significant distinction. The amount of revenue
that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company
applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the
contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct
in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies
each performance obligation.
The
Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606
at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which
of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated
to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
Deferred
Revenue
The
Company collects deposits from customers in advance for some business contracts. The customer payments received in advance are recorded
as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. The Company recognized $ 433,542 , and $ 513,072
deferred revenue as of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022,
respectively.
Leases
We
have entered into operating agreements primarily for office and factory. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For
all classes of underlying assets, we elect not to recognize right of use assets or lease liabilities when a lease has a lease term
of 12 months or less at the commencement date and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that we are reasonably
certain to exercise. Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022.
Operating
lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest
rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit
in most of our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a
collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Operating lease
assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate
the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancellable, lease term when
determining the lease assets and liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Our
lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and
utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with our lease payments and account for them together as a single lease
component, which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.
Income
Taxes
The
Company utilizes ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements or tax returns. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method to compute the differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts, using currently enacted tax rates. A valuation
allowance is recorded when it is “more likely-than-not” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The
Company’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in
the consolidated statements of operations.

Measurement
of Fair Value
The
fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities
are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the
quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined in the following three
categories:
Level
1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2: Observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level
3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
Earnings
(Loss) per Share
The
Company computes basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.”
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common
stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. As of November 30, 2022, the Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such
as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Except
for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal
securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ (“ASC”)
is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the
aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial
statements.
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 adds a current
expected credit loss (“CECL”) impairment model to U.S. GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.
Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of
the period of adoption. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within
the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the application of the CECL impairment model to have a significant impact on its allowance
for uncollectible amounts for accounts receivable.
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized
and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU should
be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted.
The
Company has implemented all new applicable accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material
impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

INCOME TAXES
The
Company’s operating subsidiaries are governed by the Income Tax Law, which is concerning Foreign Investment Enterprises and Foreign
Enterprises and various local income tax laws (“the Income Tax Laws”). We are routinely undergoing examinations in the jurisdictions
in which we operate.
The
Company has operations in Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, BVI, and China that are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions in which they
operate, as follows:
Singapore
WKL
Eco Earth Holdings is incorporated in Singapore, and under the current tax laws of Singapore, its standard corporate income tax rate
is
17 %.
Malaysia
WKL
Eco Earth, WKL Green Energy and Evoair Manufacturing (including its
100 % subsidiary Evo Air Marketing) are incorporated in Malaysia and
are subject to common corporate income tax rate at
24 %.

Cambodia
WKL
EcoEarth Indochina is incorporated in Cambodia, and under the current tax laws of Cambodia, its standard corporate tax rate is
20 %.
BVI
EvoAir
International is incorporated in BVI, and a BVI Business Company is exempt from the BVI income tax.
China
WKL
Guanzhe is incorporated in China. Under the current tax law in the PRC, WKL Guanzhe is subject to the enterprise income tax rate of
25 %.
Due
to the Company’s net loss position, there was no provision for income taxes recorded. As a result of the Company’s losses
to date, there exists doubt as to the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the
total deferred tax assets has been recorded.
The
components of net deferred tax assets are as follows:

The
Company had net operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes of approximately $ 8,839,000
at November 30, 2022, and approximately $ 7,470,000
at August 31, 2022, which may be available to offset future taxable income. Utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards may
be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 381 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carry forwards before utilization.

ROU ASSET AND LEASES
A
lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of identifiable tangible property for a period of time in exchange
for consideration. On February 28, 2022, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842 which primarily affected the accounting treatment for operating
lease agreements in which the Company is the lessee including the Company’s leases of office and factory. The Company elected to
not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities arising from short-term leases with initial lease terms of twelve months or less (deemed
immaterial) on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
ROU
assets include any prepaid lease payments and exclude any lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense for minimum
lease payments is recognized on the effective interest, the effective amortization on the lease liability. The lease terms may include
options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
When
measuring lease liabilities for leases that were classified as operating leases as of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, the Company
discounted lease payments using its estimated incremental borrowing rate of
10 %.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
and Claims
On
October 8, 2021, a filing (the “Filing”) was made with the Kuala Lumpur High Court by a reseller (the “Reseller”)
of the Company’s INCU ionic nano copper solution (the “Solution”) and the Reseller’s related party (together
with the Reseller, the “Plaintiffs”).
The
Reseller was authorized by WKL Eco Earth’s sole distributor of the Solution (the “WKL Distributor”) to resell the Solution
together with a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml through a tripartite agreement (the “Tripartite Agreement”)
entered into between (a) the Reseller, (b) the WKL Distributor and (c) a solution packaging company (the “Packaging Company”).
WKL Eco Earth was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement and did not directly authorize or engage the Reseller in the resale of the
Solution.
In
the Filing, the Plaintiffs claimed against (i) WKL Eco Earth; (ii) Dr. Low; (iii) Chan Kok Wei, (iv) the Packaging Company and (v) two
directors of the Packaging Company for loss and damages arising from an alleged breach of contract, defamation and tort of inducement.
The Plaintiffs also alleged that pursuant to the Tripartite Agreement, WKL Eco Earth was prohibited from selling the Solution to any
party other than the WKL Distributor and allow for the resale of the Solution by the Plaintiffs without limitation, and that the Plaintiffs
were not confined in their resale of the Solution to a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml.
The
Company believes the claims are without merit and will defend itself against the claims.
The
Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. The outcome of
the above case very much depends on the evidence produced and the weight of the Court places on the evidence. As it stands, WKL has a
probability of success in its Counterclaim against the parties. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this
time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

The
Company generated revenues of $142,685 in the three months ended November 30, 2022, as compared to $808,879 in the three months ended November 30 2021, a decrease in revenue of $666,194. The decline in revenue for the comparative figures is mainly due to the
decrease in sales in air purifier products as a result of rollbacking of preventative measures taken by businesses and public from spreading
infection as the World and society progresses towards living with Covid-19. The Company is building up its traction for the evoair TM
hybrid air-conditioners in 3 months ended November 2022.
Cost
of revenue was $162,858 or 114% of revenue for the three months ended November 30, 2022, as compared to $707,414 or 87% of revenue in the
same financial period in 2021. Cost of revenues includes production costs and purchases of goods. Higher cost of revenue is attributable
to manufacturing and related costs for evoair TM
products, comprising material costs, labor cost, research and development
(“R&D”) for product improvement, product testing and inspection, factory rental, depreciation expense as well as sample
products for market penetration. The higher cost of revenue than revenue in the 3 months ended November 30, 2022 is attributable to the lack of economies
of scale and the Company has yet to achieve optimal production efficiency.
Gross
loss was $20,173 or negative gross profit margin of 14% for the three months ended November 30, 2022, as compared to gross profit of
$101,465 in the same financial period in 2021 or 13% of revenue. The decrease of gross profit is mainly due to the Company
commercialized evoair TM
products with higher cost of revenue from manufacturing and related costs as well as lack of economy of
scale
during commercialization stage. The Company anticipates improvement of income and gross profit margin with the
improvement of revenue streams from distributor and dealership model, projects as well as licensing model.
Operating
expenses were $1,426,947 for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $510,057 in the corresponding period in 2021, an increase
of $916,890. The increases in operating expenses were mainly due to the commencement of amortization of intangible assets starting
from December 2021.
The
net loss for the three months ended November 30, 2022, was $1,440,143 as compared to $383,332 for the corresponding period in 2021. The
continuous net loss is attributable to the Group’s focused effort in creating the infrastructure and resource to meet the business
expansion needs of the Group’s as well as lack of economies of scale.

Seasonality
The
Company’s business is not subject to seasonality.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have
a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical
Accounting Policies
Revenue
recognition
Our
revenue recognition policy is in compliance with ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
that revenue is recognized when
a customer obtains control of promised goods and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive
in exchange for those goods. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that we expect
to receive in exchange for those goods. We apply the following five-step model in order to determine this amount:
(i)
identification
of the promised goods and services in the contract;
(ii)
determination
of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the
contract;
(iii)
measurement
of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
(v)
recognition
of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
We
only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange
for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception,
we review the contract to determine which performance obligations we must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct.
We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance
obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, our performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time,
typically upon delivery for local sales and upon shipment of the products for export sale.
For
all reporting periods, we have not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all product revenue contracts with
an original expected length of one year or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules.

Estimates
and Assumptions
In
preparing our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable,
but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results
to differ from estimated amounts. Significant estimates in 2023 and 2022 include the assumptions used to value tax liabilities, derivative
financial instruments, the estimates of the allowance for deferred tax assets, the accounts receivable allowance, impairment of intangible
assets and long-lived assets and inventory write-offs.
Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets which could impact our
estimates and assumptions. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update
to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results
could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Going
Concern
As
of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $8,838,700 and $7,465,373 respectively. The
Company incurred net loss of $1,440,362 and $383,332 for three months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, respectively.
The cash used in operating activities were $264,216 and $159,933 for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021,
respectively. It was brought to the attention of the Management to assess going concern considering all facts and circumstances
about the foreseeable future of the Company as well as its assets and liabilities on the basis that it will be able to realize and
discharge them in the normal course of business.
With
the injection of a New Business contemplated under the Transaction, the Management believes that the actions to be taken by the Management to further implement the business plans for the New Business
including expansion in product offerings, geographical expansion, generate revenue through expansion of revenue streams and customer
base (retail, commercial and industrial as well as private label and licensing clientele), improvement of profitability by achieving
economies of scale provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company is also working on
raising additional funding to finance the operations as well as business expansion.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financials have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and
accordingly financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.
Material
Commitments
We
have no material commitments as of November 30, 2022.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Except
for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority
of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the ASC is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature
recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect
will not have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial
statements.
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 adds the
CECL impairment model to U.S. GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Modified retrospective adoption is
required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU
2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within the year of adoption.
Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company does not expect the application of the CECL impairment model to have a significant impact on its allowance for
uncollectible amounts for accounts receivable.
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized
and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU should
be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted.
The
Company has implemented all new applicable accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material
impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Our
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-14(a)(e)
and 15d-14(a) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer’s Management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our Management of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2022. Based on our Management’s evaluation under the framework in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, our Management
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms.
A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection
with the assessment described above, Management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses at November
30, 2022:
●
Due to our
limited resources, we do not have enough accounting personnel with extensive experience in maintaining books and records and preparing
financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP which could lead to untimely identification and resolution of accounting matters
inherent in our financial transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
●
The Company has insufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, which led to inadequate financial statement closing process.
●
The
Company has a lack of segregation of duties, a lack of audit committee or independent governance/oversight.
Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three months period covered by this
Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On
October 8, 2021, a filing (the “Filing”) was made with the Kuala Lumpur High Court by a reseller (the “Reseller”)
of the Company’s INCU ionic nano copper solution (the “Solution”) and the Reseller’s related party (together
with the Reseller, the “Plaintiffs”).
The
Reseller was authorized by WKL Eco Earth’s sole distributor of the Solution (the “WKL Distributor”) to resell the Solution
together with a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml through a tripartite agreement (the “Tripartite Agreement”)
entered into between (a) the Reseller, (b) the WKL Distributor and (c) a solution packaging company (the “Packaging Company”).
WKL Eco Earth was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement and did not directly authorize or engage the Reseller in the resale of the
Solution.
In
the Filing, the Plaintiffs claimed against (i) WKL Eco Earth; (ii) Dr. Low; (iii) Chan Kok Wei, (iv) the Packaging Company and (v) two
directors of the Packaging Company for loss and damages arising from an alleged breach of contract, defamation and tort of inducement.
The Plaintiffs also alleged that pursuant to the Tripartite Agreement, WKL Eco Earth was prohibited from selling the Solution to any
party other than the WKL Distributor and allow for the resale of the Solution by the Plaintiffs without limitation, and that the Plaintiffs
were not confined in their resale of the Solution to a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml.
The
Company believes the claims are without merit and will defend itself against the claims.
