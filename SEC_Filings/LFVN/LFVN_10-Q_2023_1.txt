Note 1 —
Organization and Basis of Presentation LifeVantage Corporation is a company focused on nutrigenomics, the study of how nutrition and naturally occurring compounds affect human genes to support good health. The Company is dedicated to helping people achieve their health, wellness and financial goals. The Company provides quality, scientifically-validated products to customers and independent distributors as well as a financially rewarding commission-based direct sales opportunity to its independent distributors. LifeVantage sells its products in the United States, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Taiwan, Austria, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, New Zealand, Singapore, and the Philippines. The Company also sells its products in a number of countries to customers for personal consumption only. In addition, the Company sells its products in China through a China approved cross-border e-commerce business model.
The Company engages in the identification, research, development, formulation and sale of advanced nutrigenomic activators, dietary supplements, nootropics, pre- and pro-biotics, weight management, skin and hair care, bath & body, and targeted relief products. The Company’s line of scientifically-validated dietary supplements includes its flagship Protandim ®
family of products, LifeVantage ®
Omega+ ™ , ProBio ™ , IC Bright ® , and Daily Wellness ™
dietary supplements. TrueScience ®
is the Company's line of skin, hair, bath & body, and targeted relief products. The Company also markets and sells Petandim ® , its companion pet supplement formulated to combat oxidative stress in dogs, Axio ®
its nootropic energy drink mixes, and PhysIQ ™ , its smart weight management system. The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company’s management, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of the Company’s management, these interim financial statements include all adjustments that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position as of December 31, 2022, and the results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or for any future period.
The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included herein are presented as required by Form 10-Q, and do not contain certain information included in the Company’s audited financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. For further information, refer to the financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, and included in the annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Note 2 —
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates The Company prepares the condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In preparing these statements, the Company is required to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to inventory valuation and obsolescence, sales returns, income taxes and tax valuation reserves, transfer pricing methodology and positions, impairment of assets, share-based compensation, and loss contingencies. Foreign Currency Translation A portion of the Company’s business operations occurs outside the United States. The local currency of each of the Company’s subsidiaries is generally its functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at the balance sheet dates, revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates and stockholders’ equity is recorded at historical exchange rates. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded
10 as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and as a component of com prehensive income. Transaction gains and losses are included in other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net foreign currency gains of $ 0.2
million and losses of $ 0.1
million, respectively, are recorded in other expense, net. For the
six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, net foreign currency losses of $ 0.3
million and $ 0.3
million, respectively, are recorded in other expense, net.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company's subsidiaries enter into transactions with each other which may not be denominated in the respective subsidiaries' functional currencies. The Company seeks to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates through the use of derivatives. The Company does not use such derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. To hedge risks associated with the foreign-currency-denominated intercompany transactions, the Company entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which were all settled by the end of December 2021 and were not designated for hedge accounting.
There were
no
realized gains or losses for
three and six months ended
December 31, 2022. For the
three and six months ended
December 31, 2021, realized losses of $ 34,000
and $ 0.1
million related to forward contracts, are recorded in other expense, net, respectively.
The Company did not hold any derivative instruments at December 31, 2022. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers only its monetary liquid assets with original maturities of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. Concentration of Credit Risk Accounting guidance for financial instruments requires disclosure of significant concentrations of credit risk regardless of the degree of
such risk. Financial instruments with significant credit risk include cash and investments.
At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 12.4
million in cash accounts at one financial institution and $ 5.0
million in
accounts at other financial institutions.
At June 30, 2022,
the Company had $ 15.4  million in cash accounts at one financial institution and $ 4.8
million in
accounts at other financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, and during the periods then ended, the Company’s cash balances exceeded federally insured limits. Accounts Receivable The Company’s accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 consist primarily of credit card receivables. Based on the Company’s verification process for customer credit cards and historical information available, management has determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts on credit card sales related to its customer sales as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 is not necessary.
No
bad debt expense was recorded during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Inventory
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, inventory consisted of (in thousands): December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Finished goods $ 16,447   80.5   % $ 12,674   76.9   % Raw materials 3,988   19.5   % 3,798   23.1   % Total inventory $ 20,435   100.0   % $ 16,472   100.0   % Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method , which includes a reduction in inventory values
of $ 1.2
million
and $ 1.3
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, related to obsolete and slow-moving inventory. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company accounts for assets and liabilities using a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the fair-value hierarchy below. This hierarchy requires the Company to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. • Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
11 • Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and • Level 3—Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. Equity securities held by the Company are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments using fair value measurements with unobservable inputs (level 3), in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The Company generates the majority of its revenue through product sales to customers. These products include the Protandim ®
line of dietary supplements, LifeVantage ®
Omega+ ™ , ProBio ™ , IC Bright ® , and Daily Wellness ™
dietary supplements, TrueScience ®
skin, hair, bath & body and targeted relief, Petandim ® , Axio ®  nootropic energy drink mixes, and the PhysIQ ™  smart weight management system. The Company ships most of its product directly to the consumer and receives substantially all payment for product sales in the form of credit card receipts. Revenue from direct product sales to customers is recognized upon shipment, which is when passage of title and risk of loss occurs. For items sold in packs and bundles, the Company determines the standalone selling price at contract inception for each distinct good, and then allocates the transaction price on a relative standalone selling price basis. Any discounts are accounted for as a direct reduction to the transaction price. Shipping and handling revenue is recognized upon shipment when the performance obligation is completed. The Company also charges independent distributors to attend certain events that it holds. Tickets to events are sold as standalone items or included within packs. For event tickets sold in packs, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to the ticket on a relative standalone selling price basis. Any discounts are accounted for as a direct reduction to the transaction price. Fee revenue associated with ticket sales is recorded in the month that the event is held, which is when the Company has performed its obligations under the contract. Estimated returns are recorded when product is shipped. Subject to some exceptions based on local regulations, the Company’s return policy is to provide a full refund for product returned within

Leases The Company accounts for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842. The Company reviews all contracts and determines if the arrangement is or contains a lease, at inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current lease liabilities and long-term lease liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have any finance leases. Operating lease ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. The
12 Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any upfront lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. Changes in the Company's strategies have resulted in operation modifications in certain Asia/Pacific markets resulting in the closure of showrooms and changes to selling models. As of December 31, 2022, the Company abandoned the ROU assets related to the Hong Kong and Singapore showroom leases. These leases were to terminate in August and September 2023, respectively. However, the Company reached agreements with each of the landlords to modify the termination date to February 2023. The remaining lease liability for these showrooms is $ 34,000
as of December 31, 2022.
Total expenses related to the abandonment of the ROU assets and costs associated with the change in operations in these markets for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 is $ 0.4  million and is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of services to be rendered based on the grant date fair value of the equity award. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation, net of any estimated forfeitures, over the period an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, generally referred to as the requisite service period. For awards with market-based performance conditions, the cost of the awards is recognized as the requisite service is rendered by employees, regardless of when, if ever, the market-based performance conditions are satisfied. The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of stock options and options under the Company's 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The determination of the fair value of options is affected by the Company's stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company uses historical data for estimating the expected volatility and expected life of stock options required in the Black-Scholes model. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected terms of the stock options. The fair value of restricted stock grants is based on the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant less the Company's expected dividend yield. The Company recognizes compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when it concludes it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjusts compensation costs accordingly. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled, updated as needed for changes in corporate tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the effective date of the change. The Company recognizes tax liabilities or benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sust ained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue. The amount recognized would be the largest liability or benefit that the Company believes has greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized income tax expense of $ 0.2
million and $ 0.5
million, respectively, which is reflective of the Company’s current estimated federal, state and foreign effective tax rate. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Income Per Share Basic (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing the net (loss) income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, less unvested restricted stock awards. Diluted (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted-average common shares and potentially dilutive common share equivalents using the treasury stock method. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the effects of approximately
0.2
million and
0.1
million common shares, respectively, issuable upon exercise of options and non-vested shares of restricted stock are not included in
13 computations as their effect was anti-dilutive. For the
six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, the effects of approximately
0.4
million and
0.2
million common shares, respectively, issuable upon exercise of options and non-vested shares of restricted stock are not included in computations as their effect was anti-dilutive.

Gig Economy Group Investment Convertible Note Receivable The Company entered into a convertible promissory note agreement with Gig Economy Group, Inc. ("GEG") pursuant to which the Company agreed to loan to GEG up to an aggregate of $ 2.0  million in a series of loan installments, evidenced by a convertible promissory note having a maturity date of May 31, 2019 ("Convertible Note"). The Convertible Note accrued interest at a rate of
8 % per annum, compounded annually. On May 17, 2019, the Company and GEG entered into an amendment agreement to extend the maturity date of the Convertible Note to December 31, 2019. In all other aspects, the
14 Convertible Note remained unchanged from the original agreement. Pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement between the Company and GEG dated December 16, 2019, GEG issued to the Company
1,000,000
shares of GEG’s common stock in consideration for conversion and cancellation of all principal, interest and other amounts due under the Convertible Note (representing $ 0.0 million
in aggregate consideration). Equity Securities under ASC 321 Upon conversion of the convertible promissory note receivable with GEG, the Company held a minority interest (less than 20%) in GEG, accounted for under ASC 321,
Investments - Equity Securities
("ASC 321"), which is included in equity securities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Dividends received are reported in earnings if and when received. The Company reviews securities individually for impairment by evaluating if events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. If such events or circumstances have occurred, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes an impairment loss in other expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income equal to the difference between the fair value of the investment and its carrying value. In such cases, the estimated fair value of the investment is determined using unobservable inputs including assumptions by GEG's management and quantitative information such as lower valuations in recently completed or proposed financings. These inputs are classified as Level 3. Because GEG is in the early startup stage, GEG is subject to potential changes in cash flows and valuation, and may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to support its ongoing operations, which may result in future impairment. Equity securities held by the Company lack readily determinable fair values and therefore the securities are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar equity securities of the same issuer. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company determined its investment in GEG had declined significantly as a result of the business failing to achieve profitability due to weak market conditions for its products.
The Company determined the book value of its investment exceeded its fair value and concluded this decline in value was other than temporary.
The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $ 2.2  million related to these equity securities.
The was no carrying amount of equity securities held by the Company without readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no impairments recognized. Note 4 —

Long-Term Debt On March 30, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “2016 Loan Agreement”) to refinance its outstanding debt. In connection with the 2016 Loan Agreement and on the same date, the Company entered into a security agreement (the “Security Agreement”). The 2016 Loan Agreement provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $ 10.0
million (the “2016 Term Loan") and a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $ 2.0
million (the “2016 Revolving Loan,” and collectively with the 2016 Term Loan, the 2016 Loan Agreement and the Security Agreement, the “2016 Credit Facility”).
The principal amount of the 2016 Term Loan is payable in consecutive quarterly installments in the amount of $ 0.5
million plus accrued interest beginning with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016. If the Company borrows under the 2016 Revolving Loan, interest will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter. On May 4, 2018, the Company entered into a loan modification agreement, which amended the 2016 Credit Facility (“Amendment No. 1”). Amendment No. 1 revised the maturity date from March 30, 2019 to March 31, 2021 and increased the fixed interest rate for the term loan from
4.93 % to
5.68 %. Amendment No. 1 also revised certain financial covenants. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 1) was revised from a minimum of
1.50
to 1.00 to
1.25
to 1.00, measured on a trailing
twelve-month
basis, at the end of each fiscal quarter. The minimum working capital was increased from $ 5.0
million to $ 8.0
million. The funded debt to EBITDA ratio was replaced with the total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 1) of not greater than
3.00
to 1.00 at the end of each quarter. The minimum tangible net worth measure was removed from the financial covenants. The Company’s obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended, are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets. Loans outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended, may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. In addition, if, at any time, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Loan exceeds $ 2.0
million, the Company must prepay an amount equal to such excess. Any principal amount of the 2016 Term Loan which is prepaid or repaid may not be re-borrowed. On February 1, 2019, the Company entered into a loan modification agreement, which further amended the 2016 Credit Facility ("Amendment No. 2"). Under Amendment No. 2, the Company made a principal payment of $ 2.0
million and increased the revolving loan facility from $ 2.0
million to $ 5.0
million. Amendment No. 2 also revised certain financial covenants. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 2) was revised from a minimum of
1.25
to 1.00 to
1.10
to 1.00, measured on a trailing
twelve-month
basis, at the end of each fiscal quarter. The minimum working capital was decreased from $ 8.0
million to $ 6.0
million. On April 1, 2021, the Company entered into a loan modification agreement ("Amendment No. 3"), which amended the 2016 Credit Facility, as previously amended. Amendment No. 3 revised the maturity date from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2024 and modified the variable interest rate based on the one-month United States Treasury Rate, plus a margin of
3.00 %, with an interest rate floor of
4.00 %. Amendment No. 3 also revised the debt (total liabilities) to tangible net worth ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 3) covenant to require that the Company maintain this ratio not in excess of
2.00
to 1.00, measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and revised the definition and calculation of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 3).
The Company entered into a loan modification agreement ("Amendment No. 4"), effective September 30, 2022, which amended the 2016 Credit Facility, as previously amended. Amendment No. 4 revised the calculation of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 4) and allows the Company to declare and pay dividends, up to $ 500,000
per quarter, through September 30, 2023.
There were no other changes to the covenants or revolving loan facility as set forth in Amendment No. 3. The 2016 Credit Facility, as amended, contains customary covenants, including affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to create certain types of liens, incur additional indebtedness, declare or pay dividends on or redeem capital stock, make other payments to holders of equity interests in the Company, make certain investments, purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all the assets or equity interests of other companies, sell assets or enter into consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or any substantial part of the Company’s assets. The 2016 Credit Facility, as amended, also contains various financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain consolidated working capital amounts, total liabilities to tangible net worth ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. Additionally, the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended, contains cross-default provisions, whereby a default under the terms of certain indebtedness or an uncured default of a payment or other material obligation of the Company under a material contract of the Company will cause a default on the remaining indebtedness under the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended. The Company’s book value for the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended, approximates the fair value. During the fiscal year
16 ended June 30, 2020, the Company repaid, in full, the remaining balance of the 2016 Term Loan in accordance with the terms of the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended. Note 6 —

Note 8 —
Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies The Company accounts for contingent liabilities in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies. This guidance requires management to assess potential contingent liabilities that may exist as of the date of the financial statements to determine the probability and amount of loss that may have occurred, which inherently involves an exercise of judgment. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. For loss contingencies considered remote, no accrual or disclosures are generally made. Management has assessed potential contingent liabilities as of
December 31, 2022, and based on the assessment, there are no probable loss contingencies requiring accrual or disclosures within its financial statements. 18 Legal Accruals In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, from time to time, the Company is subject to various claims, pending and potential legal actions, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of its business. Management assesses contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in the consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because evaluating legal claims and litigation results are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable results could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. When evaluating contingencies, management may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. In addition, damage amounts claimed or asserted against the Company may be unsupported, exaggerated or unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of a potential liability. Management regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of financial statement accruals and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. It is possible that cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable publicity or resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Whether any losses finally determined in any claim, action, investigation or proceeding or publicity related to such could reasonably have a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such losses; the structure and type of any remedies; the significance of the impact of any such losses, damages or remedies may have on the consolidated financial statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. Class Action Lawsuit ( Smith v. LifeVantage Corp .):
On January 24, 2018, a purported class action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, entitled Smith v. LifeVantage Corp., Case No. 3:18-cv-a35 (D. Connecticut filed Jan. 24, 2018). In this action, Plaintiffs alleged that the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Sales Officer and Chief Marketing Officer operated a pyramid scheme in violation of a variety of federal and state statutes, including RICO and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. On April 16, 2018, the Company filed motions with the court to dismiss the complaint against LifeVantage, dismiss the complaint against the Company's executives, transfer the venue of the case from the State of Connecticut to the State of Utah, and contest class certification. On July 23, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation with the Court agreeing to transfer the case to the Federal District Court for Utah. On September 20, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in Utah. As per the parties stipulated agreement, Plaintiffs' amended complaint dropped the RICO and Connecticut state law claims and removed the Company's Chief Sales Officer and Chief Marketing Officer as individual defendants (the former Chief Executive Officer remains a defendant in the case). The Plaintiffs' amended complaint added an antitrust claim, alleging that the Company fraudulently obtained patents for its products and is attempting to use those patents in an anti-competitive manner. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint on November 5, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a response to the Company’s Motion to Dismiss on December 17, 2018, and the Company filed a reply brief on January 10, 2019. The Court ruled on the motion on December 5, 2019, dismissing
three
of the Plaintiff's
four
claims, including the antitrust claim, unjust enrichment claim, and the securities claim for the sale of unregistered securities. On December 19, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint which included three causes of action, including a 10(b)(5) securities fraud claim, and renewed claims relating to the sale of unregistered securities and unjust enrichment. LifeVantage filed a Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on January 28, 2020, and with the Motion fully briefed by the parties as of March 17, 2020, the Court decided the matter on the parties’ briefs only on November 25, 2020. In its decision, the Court dismissed with prejudice the Plaintiffs’ Section 12(1) claim (sale of an unregistered security), because the Court concluded the claim is time barred. The Court also dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claim for unjust enrichment against LifeVantage without prejudice, and the Plaintiffs did not amend their complaint following the Court’s order to re-plead unjust enrichment. The court found that the Plaintiffs had sufficiently pled their claim under Section 12(2) (offer to sell a security that misstates or omits a material fact by means of a prospectus or oral communication). LifeVantage filed its Answer to the Second Amended Complaint on December 23, 2020, responding to the Plaintiffs’ remaining securities claims. On February 2, 2021, the Court issued an amended scheduling order that reflects the parties’ agreement on a schedule for discovery and other litigation matters. On June 15, 2021, the plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification, and on July 13, 2021, the defendants, including LifeVantage Corporation, filed their opposition brief that opposed class certification. On July 27, 2021, the Plaintiffs filed their reply to LifeVantage’s opposition brief. The court held a hearing for the motion for class certification on March 28, 2022. On April 19, 2022, the court issued an order denying the Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. On December 15, 2022, the case was dismissed with prejudice, which concluded litigation. Other Matters.
In addition to the matters described above, the Company also may become involved in other litigation and regulatory matters incidental to its business and the matters disclosed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including, but not limited to, product liability claims, regulatory actions, employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company intends to defend itself in any such matters and does not currently believe that the outcome of any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
19 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are a company focused on nutrigenomics, the study of how nutrition and naturally occurring compounds affect human genes to support good health. We are dedicated to helping people achieve their health, wellness and financial goals. We provide quality, scientifically-validated products to customers an d independent distributors as
well as a financially rewarding commission-based direct sales opportunity to our independent distributors. We engage in the identification, research, development, formulation and sale of advanced nutrigenomic activators, dietary supplements, nootropics, pre- and pro-biotics, weight management, skin and hair care, bath & body, and targeted relief products. We currently sell our products to customers and independent distributors in two geographic regions that we have classified as the Americas region and the Asia/Pacific & Europe region. The success and growth of our business is primarily based on the effectiveness of our independent distributors to attract and retain customers in order to sell our products and our ability to attract and retain independent distributors. When we are successful in attracting and retaining independent distributors and customers, it is largely because of: • Our products, including our flagship Protandim ®
family of scientifically-validated dietary supplements, LifeVantage ®
Omega+ ™ , ProBio ™ , IC Bright ® , and Daily Wellness ™
dietary supplements, our line of Nrf2 enhanced TrueScience® skin, hair, bath & body, and targeted relief products, Petandim ® , our companion pet supplement formulated to combat oxidative stress in dogs, Axio ® , our nootropic energy drink mixes, and PhysIQ ™ , our smart weight management system; • Our sales compensation plan and other sales initiatives and incentives; and • Our delivery of superior customer service. As a result, it is vital to our success that we leverage our product development resources to develop and introduce compelling and innovative products and provide opportunities for our independent distributors to sell these products in a variety of markets. We sell our products in the United States, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Taiwan, Austria, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, New Zealand, Singapore, and the Philippines. In addition, we sell our products in a number of countries to customers for personal consumption only and in China through a China approved cross-border e-commerce business model. Entering a new market requires a considerable amount of time, resources and continued support. If we are unable to properly support an existing or new market, our revenue growth may be negatively impacted. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has continued to disrupt our business in certain markets in fiscal year 2023. Our independent distributors have continued to experience disruptions. Specifically, in Japan, independent distributors are required to provide a hard-copy introductory packet (gaiyoshomen) in person to each person they approach to sponsor as an independent distributor before presenting our products and business opportunity. This requirement inhibits independent distributors from connecting with potential new independent distributors virtually or through social media. Accordingly, quarantines, avoidance of public places and general concerns about physical distancing related to COVID-19 or otherwise negatively affected the ability for independent distributors to meet people in person and commence the enrollment process. To mitigate these effects and in an effort to sustain their sales volume, our independent distributors have adapted their approach for customer outreach and enrollment, including transitioning to a stronger social media presence. Our business may, in the future, experience additional disruptions and be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of limitations on the ability of our suppliers to manufacture, or procure from manufacturers, the products we sell or any of the raw materials or components required in the production process, or to meet delivery requirements and commitments; limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home; limitations on the ability of carriers to deliver our products to customers; limitations on the ability of our independent distributors to conduct their businesses and purchase our products; and limitations on the ability of our independent distributors or customers to continue to purchase our products due to decreased disposable income. We have made modifications and are continuing to evaluate additional potential modifications that may be needed, to protect our supply chain and preserve adequate liquidity to ensure that our business can continue to operate during
uncertain times. Near the end of fiscal year 2020 we transitioned all of our corporate employees to a work from home model and during July 2021 we began to implement a hybrid schedule with opportunities for employees to return back to the office. That hybrid schedule continues to be in effect today. To date, our employees are performing and adapting well with the evolving environment. With respect to liquidity, we are evaluating and taking actions to ensure that we continue to responsibly manage expenses across our organization. 20 We will continue to actively monitor how COVID-19 or any similar situation might affect business operations.
We may take any necessary actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, independent distributors, customers, and stockholders. Our

We currently have additional products in development. Any delays or difficulties in intr oducing compelling products or attractive initiatives or tools into our markets may have a negative impact on our revenue and our ability to attract new independent distributors and customers.
Accounts Because we utilize a direct selling model for the distribution of a majority of our products, the success and growth of our business is primarily based on the effectiveness of our independent distributors to attract customers and sell our products and our ability to attract new and retain existing independent distributors. Changes in our product sales typically are the result of variations in product sales volume relating to fluctuations in the number of active independent distributors and customers purchasing our products. The number of active independent distributors and customers is, therefore, used by management as a key non-financial measure. 21 The following tables summarize the changes in our active accounts base by geographic region. These numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand as of the dates indicated. For purposes of this report, we define “Active Accounts” as only those independent distributors and customers who have purchased from us at any time during the most recent three-month period, either for personal use or for resale. As of December 31, 2022 2021 Change from Prior Year Percent Change Active Independent Distributors     Americas 36,000  60.0  % 38,000  61.3  % (2,000) (5.3) %     Asia/Pacific & Europe 24,000  40.0  % 24,000  38.7  % —  —  %         Total Active Independent Distributors 60,000  100.0  % 62,000  100.0  % (2,000) (3.2) % Active Customers     Americas 69,000  77.5  % 75,000  74.3  % (6,000) (8.0) %     Asia/Pacific & Europe 20,000  22.5  % 26,000  25.7  % (6,000) (23.1) %         Total Active Customers 89,000  100.0  % 101,000  100.0  % (12,000) (11.9) % Active Accounts     Americas 105,000  70.5  % 113,000  69.3  % (8,000) (7.1) %     Asia/Pacific & Europe 44,000  29.5  % 50,000  30.7  % (6,000) (12.0) %         Total Active Accounts 149,000  100.0  % 163,000  100.0  % (14,000) (8.6) % Results of Operations Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenue.
We generated net revenue of $53.7 million and $52.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We generated net revenue of $105.4 million and $105.4 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted our revenue $2.4 million or 4.5% and $5.0 million or 4.8% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Americas . The following table sets forth revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Americas region (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 % Change 2022 2021 % Change United States $ 37,972  $ 32,897  15.4  % $ 72,630  $ 67,195  8.1  % Other 1,733  1,811  (4.3) % 3,444  3,962  (13.1) % Americas Total $ 39,705  $ 34,708  14.4  % $ 76,074  $ 71,157  6.9  % Re venue in the Americas region for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $5.0 million or 14.4% and $4.9 million or 6.9%, respectively, from the prior year periods.
Total Active Accounts decreased by 7.1% in the region compared to the prior year
period. The decrease in total Active Accounts was offset by an increase in average revenue per account due to changes in our product sales mix, driven primarily by our new TrueScience ®
Liquid Collagen product announced during our Activate 2022 event held in June 2022.
22 Asia/Pacific & Europe . The following table sets forth revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Asia/Pacific & Europe region and its principal markets (in thousands):   Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 % Change 2022 2021 % Change Japan $ 7,365  $ 9,991  (26.3) % $ 15,533  $ 19,834  (21.7) % Australia & New Zealand 2,020  3,352  (39.7) % 4,117  6,899  (40.3) % Greater China 924  1,697  (45.6) % 2,000  2,795  (28.4) % Other 3,648  2,441  49.4  % 7,712  4,729  63.1  % Asia/Pacific & Europe Total $ 13,957  $ 17,481  (20.2) % $ 29,362  $ 34,257  (14.3) % Revenue in the Asia/Pacific & Europe region decreased $3.5 million or 20.2% and $4.9 million or 14.3% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as com pared to the prior year periods. Active Accounts in the region decreased 12.0% compared to the prior year
period. Decreases in total Active Accounts along with negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have contributed to the overall decrease in revenue within the Asia/Pacific & Europe region. We continue to be encouraged by the results we are seeing from our launch of Philippines due to continued distributor leadership development and advancement. Overall, revenue in the Asia/Pacific & Europe region was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the amount of approximately $2.3 million or 13.3% and $4.9 million or 14.5% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, mainly due to currency fluctuations in Japan. Revenue in Japan was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the amount of approximately $1.8 million or 17.3% and $3.9 million or 19.3%, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. On a constant currency basis, revenue in Japan decreased 8.3% and 2.0% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods.
Globally, our sales and marketing efforts continue to be directed toward strengthening our core business through our fiscal year initiatives and building our worldwide revenue. During fiscal year 2022, we launched our new LifeVantage ®
IC Bright ®
eye health product in October 2021 and TrueScience ®
Liquid Collagen in June 2022. We have plans for continued product expansion during the remaining fiscal 2023. We expect these product launches will help drive revenue growth globally through increased average order size and increased ability to attract and retain new independent distributors and customers with a compelling product lineup. Gross Margin.
Our gross profit percentage for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 78.1% and 81.5%, respectively. Our gross profit percentage for the
six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021 was 79.4% and 81.9%, respectively. The decrease in gross margins, as compared to the prior year periods, is primarily due to increased shipping to customer expenses during the current year period as well as shifts in geographic and product sales mix.
Commissions and Incentives.
Commissions and incentives expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $23.6 million or 43.9% of revenue as compared to $25.4 million or 48.8% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Commissions and incentives expenses during the
six months ended December 31, 2022
were $47.4 million or 44.9% of revenue as compared to $49.6 million or 47.0% of revenue for the
six months ended December 31, 2021 . The decrease in commissions and incentives expenses as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year periods is due mainly to the price increases on many of our products during the current period as well as due to the timing and magnitude of our various promotional and incentive programs. Commissions and incentives expenses, as a percentage of revenue, may fluctuate in future periods based on ability to hold incentive trips and events and the timing and magnitude of compensation, incentive and promotional programs. Selling, General and Administrative.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $19.6 million or 36.5% of revenue as compared to $17.4 million or 33.4% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2021 .
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $36.3 million
or 34.4% of revenue as compared to $32.5 million or 30.8% of revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year periods is primarily due to increased event and travel expenses, employee compensation, and outside professional services related to upcoming initiatives launching in the second half of fiscal 2023.
These increases have been offset by decreases in legal, accounting, and tax services.
Total Other Income (Expens e).
During the
three months ended December 31, 2022
we recognized total net other income of $0.2 million as compared to expense of $0.1 million for the
three months ended December 31, 2021 . During the
six months
23 ended December 31, 2022
we recognized total net other expense of $0.3 million as compared to $0.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Total net other income (expense) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted primarily of foreign currency gains and losses.
Income Tax Benefit (Expense) . We recognized income tax benefit of $17,000 and expense of $0.2 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to income tax benefit of $0.6 million and expense $0.5 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period was mainly due to a change in taxable income. We expect that our effective tax rate will fluctuate slightly during the remainder of fiscal 2023 as the impact of discrete items and other permanent differences are recognized during the year; however, our tax rate can be impacted by various book to tax differences and fluctuations in our stock price that occur during the year which are difficult to forecast. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our primary liquidity and capital resource requirements are to finance the cost of our planned operating expenses and working capital (principally inventory purchases), fund capital expenditures, and service our debt, which includes any outstanding balances under the 2016 Credit Facility.
We have generally relied on cash flow from operations to fund operating activities and we have, at times, incurred long-term debt in order to fund stock repurchases and strategic transactions. As of December 31, 2022, our available liquidity was $17.4 million, which consisted of available cash and cash equivalents. This represents a decrease of $2.8 million from the $20.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, our net cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million as compared to our net cash provided by operating activities of $4.5 million during the six months ended December 31, 2021. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, our net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 million, as a result of the purchase of fixed assets. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, our net cash used in investing activities was $0.9 million, as a result of the purchase of fixed assets. Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.7 million as a result of our payment of a cash dividend and shares purchased as payment of tax withholding upon vesting of equity awards, partially offset by proceeds from stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2021 was $6.5 million as a result of our repurchas e of common stock, and shares purchased as payment of tax
withholding upon vesting of equity awards, partially offset by proceeds from stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the total amount of our foreign subsidiary cash
was $6.4 million
and $7.0 million, respectively. The federal tax reform legislation that was passed into law during December 2017 enacted a 100% dividend deduction for greater than 10% owned foreign corporations. Therefore, in the future, if needed, we expect to be able to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries without paying additional U.S. taxes. At December 31, 2022, we had working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of $21.0 million, compared to working capital of $21.2 million at June 30, 2022. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances and our ongoing cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. The majority of our historical expenses have been variable in nature and as such, a potential reduction in the level of revenue would reduce our cash flow needs. In the event that our current cash balances and future cash flow from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations or strategic needs, we would consider raising additional funds, which may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Our credit facility, however, contains covenants that restrict our ability to raise additional funds in the debt markets and repurchase our equity securities without prior approval from the lender. Additionally, our credit facility, as amended, provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount up to $5.0 million. We would also consider realigning our strategic plans including a reduction in capital spending and expenses. Capital Resources Shelf Registration Statement On March 24, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement (the "Shelf Registration") on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective April 3, 2020, which permits us to offer up to $75 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. Our Shelf Registration is
24 intended to provide us with additional flexibility to access capital markets for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other purposes, working capital, capital expenditures, other corporate expenses and acquisitions of assets, licenses, products, technologies or businesses. 2016 Credit Facility On March 30, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement (the “2016 Loan Agreement”) to refinance our outstanding debt. In connection with the 2016 Loan Agreement and on the same date, we entered into a security agreement (the “Security Agreement”). The 2016 Loan Agreement provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million (the “2016 Term Loan") and a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0 million (the “2016 Revolving Loan,” and collectively with the 2016 Term Loan, the 2016 Loan Agreement and the Security Agreement, the “2016 Credit Facility”).
The principal amount of the 2016 Term Loan was payable in consecutive quarterly installments in the amount of $0.5 million plus accrued interest beginning with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016. If we borrow under the 2016 Revolving Loan, interest will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter. On May 4, 2018, we entered into a loan modification agreement, which amended the 2016 Credit Facility (“Amendment No. 1”). Amendment No. 1 revised the maturity date from March 30, 2019 to March 31, 2021 and increased the fixed interest rate for the term loan from 4.93% to 5.68%. Amendment No. 1 also revised certain financial covenants. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 1) was revised from a minimum of 1.50 to 1.00 to 1.25 to 1.00, measured on a trailing twelve-month basis, at the end of each fiscal quarter. The minimum working capital was increased from $5.0 million to $8.0 million. The funded debt to EBITDA ratio was replaced with the total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 1) of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00 at the end of each quarter. The minimum tangible net worth measure was removed from the financial covenants. On February 1, 2019, we entered into a loan modification agreement, which further amended the 2016 Credit Facility ("Amendment No. 2"). Under Amendment No. 2, we made a principal payment of $2.0 million and increased the revolving loan facility from $2.0 million to $5.0 million. Amendment No. 2 also revised certain financial covenants. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 2) was revised from a minimum of 1.25 to 1.00 to 1.10 to 1.00, measured on a trailing twelve-month basis, at the end of each fiscal quarter. The minimum working capital was decreased from $8.0 million to $6.0 million. On April 1, 2021, we entered into a loan modification agreement ("Amendment No. 3"), which amended the 2016 Credit Facility, as previously amended. Amendment No. 3 revised the maturity date from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2024 and modified the variable interest rate based on the one-month United States Treasury Rate, plus a margin of 3.00%, with an interest rate floor of 4.00%. Amendment No. 3 also revised the debt (total liabilities) to tangible net worth ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 3) covenant to require that we maintain this ratio not in excess of 2.00 to 1.00, measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and revised the definition and calculation of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 3).
There were no other changes to the covenants or revolving loan facility amount as set forth in Amendment No. 2. We entered into a loan modification agreement ("Amendment No. 4"), effective September 30, 2022, which amended the 2016 Credit Facility, as previously amended. Amendment No. 4 revised the calculation of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 4) and allows us to declare and pay dividends, up to $500,000 per quarter, through September 30, 2023.
There were no other changes to the covenants or revolving loan facility as set forth in Amendment No. 3. The 2016 Credit Facility, as amended, contains customary covenants, including affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to create certain types of liens, incur additional indebtedness, declare or pay dividends on or redeem capital stock, make other payments to holders of our equity interests, make certain investments, purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all the assets or equity interests of other companies, sell assets or enter into consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or any substantial part of our assets. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable non-financial and restrictive covenants under the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended.
The 2016 Credit Facility, as amended, also contains various financial covenants that require us to maintain certain consolidated working capital amounts, total liabilities to tangible net worth ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. Specifically, we must: • Maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the 2016 Loan Agreement, as amended) of at least 1.10 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter, measured on a trailing twelve month basis; • Maintain minimum consolidated working capital (as defined in the 2016 Loan Agreement, as amended) at the end of each fiscal quarter of at least $6.0 million; and 25 • Maintain a ratio of debt (total liabilities) to tangible net worth (as defined in the 2016 Loan Agreement, as amended) of not greater than 2.00 to 1.00 at the end of each quarter, measured on a trailing twelve month basis. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended. Additionally, management anticipates that in the normal course of operations we will be in compliance with the financial covenants during the ensuing year. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we repaid, in full, the remaining balance of the 2016 Term Loan in accordance with the terms of the 2016 Credit Facility, as amended.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or estimates. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures noted below. Allowances for Product Returns We record allowances for product returns at the time we ship the product based on estimated return rates. Subject to some exceptions based on local regulations, our return policy is to provide a full refund for product returned within 30 days. After 30 days of purchase, only unopened product that is in a resalable and restockable condition may be returned within twelve months of purchase and shall receive a 100% refund, less a 10% handling and restocking fee and any shipping and handling costs. As of December 31, 2022, our shipments of products sold totaling approxi mately $17.5 million
were subject to the return policy.
We monitor our product returns estimate on an ongoing basis and revise the allowances to reflect our experience. Our allowance for product returns was $0.2 million at December 31, 2022, compared with $0.1 million at June 30, 2022. To date, product expiration dates have not played any role in product returns, and we do not expect that they will in the future as it is unlikely that we will ship product with an expiration date earlier than the latest allowable product return date.
Inventory Valuation
We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. Accordingly, we reduce our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability
26 equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value. Factors utilized in the determination of net realizable value include: (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new production introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence. During the
three and six months ended
December 31, 2022 we recognized expenses of approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to obsolete and slow-moving inventory. During the
three and six months ended
December 31, 2021 we recognized expenses of approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to obsolete and slow-moving inventory. Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes that we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Stock-Based Compensation
We use the fair value approach to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with current accounting guidance. We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. We reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment. For awards with market-based performance conditions, the cost of the awards is recognized as the requisite service is rendered by the employees, regardless of when, if ever, the market-based performance conditions are satisfied. Research and Development Costs
We expense all of our costs related to research and development activities as incurred. Legal Accruals We are occasionally involved in lawsuits and disputes arising in the normal course of business. Management regularly reviews all pending litigation matters in which we are involved and establishes accruals as we deem appropriate for these litigation matters when a probable loss estimate can be made. Estimated accruals require management judgment about future events. The results of lawsuits are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur. As such, the amount of loss may differ from management estimates. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There were no substantial changes to our market risks during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the disclosures in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness and design and operation of such disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were designed and operating effectively as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 27 An evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter. That evaluation did not identify any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PART II. Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings See Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of our legal proceedings. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in “Part I. Item 1A — Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, filed on August 23, 2022. The risks and uncertainties described in such risk factors and elsewhere in this report have the potential to materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, projected results and future prospects. We do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our recent SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-K, as referenced above. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On November 27, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, as amended on February 1, 2019, August 27, 2020, and February 17, 2022. Under the plan, we are authorized to repurchase up to $60.0 million of our outstanding shares through November 30, 2023. The repurchase program permits us to purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods, including in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or other means as determined by our management, in accordance with applicable securities laws. As part of the repurchase program, we have entered into a pre-arranged stock repurchase plan which operates in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, any transactions under such stock repurchase plan will be completed in accordance with the terms of the plan, including specified price, volume and timing conditions. The authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased no shares of our common stock under this repurchase program.
At December 31, 2022, there is $27.7 million remaining under this repurchase program. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5.
