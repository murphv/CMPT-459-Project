Effective October 21, 2021, the Company changed its name from Panamera Healthcare Corporation to Panamera Holdings Corporation and increased the number of authorized common stock from
150,000,000
shares of common stock to
550,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $ 0.0001  per share. The Company’s fiscal year end is July 31.   The Company intended to offer management and consulting services to healthcare organizations but have redirected our efforts now to pursuing business opportunities including but not limited to the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation with integration. To date, the Company’s activities have been limited to its formation and the raising of equity capital and consulting services related to an agreement effective on March 1, 2022 with First DP Ventures, LP dba First Primary Care of Houston, Texas.   NOTE 2 -   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited interim financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.   In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the unaudited interim financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended July 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on January 06, 2023.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.   Commitments and Contingencies   The Company follows ASC 450-20, “Loss Contingencies,” to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.     7 Table of Contents   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with  ASC 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract.   Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps:     (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer;   (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract;   (iii) Determine the transaction price;   (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;   (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.   When the Company enters into a contract, the Company analyses the services required in the contract in order to identify the required performance obligations which would indicate the Company has met and fulfilled its obligations. For the current contracts in place, the Company has identified performance obligations as one single event, the sign-off by both parties that production is completed, and the product (film) is ready for distribution. To appropriately identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services required to be satisfied per the contract, whether explicitly stated or implicitly implied. The Company allocates the full transaction price to the single performance obligation being satisfied.   The Company has one annual consulting contract that requires a fixed monthly payment of $ 8,333 . The company recognizes the monthly revenue at the beginning of the month and any cash payments received in advanced are recorded as deferred revenue until all obligations have been met as specified in the related customer contract.   As of January 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022, the Company recorded a customer deposit of $ 0  and $ 1,500  for an advance on revenue, respectively.   Reclassification   Certain accounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.   NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has a loss from operations, an accumulated deficit of $ 414,657  and has earned limited revenues of $ 50,001 . The Company intends to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements and related party advances, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending July 31, 2023.   The ability of the Company to emerge from an early stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.    These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   During the six months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company’s shareholders financed of $ 10,000  and $ 7,228  for operation expenses. As of January 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022, the Company was obliged for an unsecured, non-interest-bearing demand loan with balance of $ 43,946  and $ 33,946 , respectively. The Company recognized interest of $ 1,798  on advance by related party and recorded it as additional paid-in-capital.   As discussed in Note 5, related parties surrendered common stock to the Company.
8 Table of Contents   During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recognized and paid $ 44,000  salary to a member of the board of directors for services rendered to the Company. As at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company recognized a prepaid wages of $ 0  and $ 1,098  for overpayment of salary, respectively.   The Company does not own or lease property or lease office space. The office space used by the Company was arranged by the founder, who is also a director of the Company, to use at no charge.   NOTE 5 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY   Preferred Stock   The Company has authorized  50,000,000  shares of preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.0001  per share. No preferred stock was issued or outstanding as at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022.   Common Stock   The Company has authorized  550,000,000  shares of common stock with a par value of $ 0.0001  per share.   On December 6, 2022, the Company entered into a share surrender agreement with two shareholders, who are also directors of the Company, whereby they voluntarily surrendered
6,000,000
shares of common stock to the Company to be held as treasury stock. The shares of common stock were originally issued as founders shares on May 21, 2014, at par value and therefore upon surrender there was no gain or loss.
As of January 31, 2023, there were  39,210,000
shares of common stock issued and
3,321,000
shares of common stock outstanding.   As of July 31, 2022, there were
39,210,000
shares of common stock issued and outstanding.   Treasury stock   The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock is comprised of shares of common stock purchased by the Company at par value. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had  6,000,000  shares of treasury stock valued at $ 600 .
NOTE 6 – CONCENTRATION   Revenue   During the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company entered into a consulting agreement in the field of Healthcare for a monthly fee of $ 8,333  with First DP Ventures, LP. The services were performed by a member of the Company’s board of directors pursuant to an Employment Contract. As of January 31, 2023, all revenue of $ 50,001  and accounts receivable of $ 8,333  were diverted from one customer.   Cost of revenue   During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the cost of revenue of $ 48,864  was for the payroll expenses related to a member of the Company’s board of directors, who performed the consulting agreement ‘s services.   NOTE 7– COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   The Company had no other commitments or contingencies as of January 31, 2023.   From time to time the Company may become a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company.   Management believes that it is adequately insured for its operations and there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.   NOTE 8 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued. Based on our evaluation no material events have occurred that require disclosure.     9 Table of Contents   Item 2.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report.   In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.   As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “our Company” mean Panamera Holdings Corporation, unless otherwise indicated.   General Overview   We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 20, 2014. Effective October 21,2021, the Company changed its name from Panamera Healthcare Corporation to Panamera Holdings Corporation and increased the number of authorized common stock from 150,000,000 shares of common stock to 550,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001per share. Prior management intended to offer management and consulting services to healthcare organizations, but current management have redirected our efforts now to pursuing business opportunities including but not limited to the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation with integration.   We have since changed our focus to looking for other business opportunities to implement and/or operating companies with which to engage in a business combination as described above. As we pursue those other business opportunities, we have commenced business operations by engaging to act as a consultant to a healthcare organization through the services of an employee pursuant to a consulting agreement with First DP Ventures, LP dba First Primary Care of Houston, Texas as referenced in the 8-K filed May 24, 2022.   Our address is 1218 Webster Street, Houston, Texas. Our telephone number is (713) 289-6200.   We have not ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.     10 Table of Contents   COVID-19   A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019, and subsequently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. As a result of the outbreak, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and in markets served. The Company considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of operations and financial position as of January 31, 2023. The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s plan of operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability to identify and implement new business opportunities and/or consummate an acceptable merger or acquisition transaction.   Plan of Operations and Cash Requirements   We are no longer attempting to implement our original business plan. We now intend to look for other business opportunities to implement and/or operating companies with which to engage in a business combination including but not limited to the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation with integration. Our focus will be on achieving long-term growth potential.   As we pursue those other business opportunities, we have commenced business operations by engaging to act as a consultant to a healthcare organization, First DP Ventures, LP dba First Primary Care of Houston, Texas, through the services of an employee.
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s management. While the Company has limited assets and minimal operating revenues, the Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities and/or combinations in in any type of business, industry or geographical location. In its efforts, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:     (a) potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products.         (b) competitive position as compared to other operations of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole.         (c) strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment.         (d) capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources.         (e) the cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials.         (f) the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; and         (g) the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items.
In applying the foregoing criteria, not one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Registrant’s limited capital available for investigation, the Registrant may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. In addition, we will be competing against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing the implementation of any opportunities and/or business combinations.     11 Table of Contents   Results of Operations    The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the period ended January 31, 2023, which are included herein.   Our operating results for the three months ended January 31,2023 and 2022 and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows.   Results of Operations for the three months ended January 31,2023 and 2022       Three Months Ended             January 31,             2023     2022     Changes

For the six months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, we received $10,000 and $7,228 from advances to pay certain operation expenses from related party loans, respectively.   Going Concern   As of January 31, 2023, our company had a net loss of $16,617 and has earned $50,001 revenues. Our company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending July 31, 2023. The ability of our company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of our business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.   Critical Accounting Policies   The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract.     14 Table of Contents   Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps:     (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer;   (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract;   (iii) Determine the transaction price;   (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;   (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.   When the Company enters into a contract, the Company analyses the services required in the contract in order to identify the required performance obligations which would indicate the Company has met and fulfilled its obligations. For the current contracts in place, the Company has identified performance obligations as one single event, the sign-off by both parties that production is completed, and the product (film) is ready for distribution. To appropriately identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services required to be satisfied per the contract, whether explicitly stated or implicitly implied. The Company allocates the full transaction price to the single performance obligation being satisfied.   The company recognizes the monthly revenue at the beginning of the month and any cash payments received in advanced are recorded as deferred revenue until all obligations have been met as specified in the related customer contract.    During the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company entered in a consulting agreement in the field of Healthcare for monthly $8,333 with First DP Ventures, LP. The services were performed by a member of the Company’s board of directors pursuant to an Employment Contract. As of January 31, 2023, all revenue of $50,001 and accounts receivable of $8,333 were diverted from one customer.   Cost of revenue   During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the cost of revenue of $48,864 was for the payroll expenses related to a member of the Company’s board of directors, who performed the consulting agreement ‘s services.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   As a “smaller reporting company,” we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     15 Table of Contents   An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms as a result of the following material weaknesses: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management is dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls.   A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.   We expect to be materially dependent upon a third party to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements.   Changes in Internal Controls   There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the six  months ended January 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     16 Table of Contents   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation, and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party, and which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company. To date, our Company has never been involved in litigation, as either a party or a witness, nor has our Company been involved in any legal proceedings commenced by any regulatory agency against our Company.   Item 1A. Risk Factors.   As a “smaller reporting company,” we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   None.   Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.   None.   Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.   Not Applicable.   Item 5.
