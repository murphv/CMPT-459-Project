DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Coty Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Coty”) manufacture, market, sell and distribute branded beauty products, including fragrances, color cosmetics and skin & body related products throughout the world. Coty is a global beauty company with a rich entrepreneurial history and an iconic portfolio of brands. The Company operates on a fiscal year basis with a year-end of June 30. Unless otherwise noted, any reference to a year preceded by the word “fiscal” refers to the fiscal year ended June 30 of that year. For example, references to “fiscal 2023” refer to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the term “includes” and “including” means, unless the context otherwise indicates, including without limitation. The Company’s sales generally increase during the second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand associated with the winter holiday season. Financial performance, working capital requirements, sales, cash flows and borrowings generally experience variability during the three to six months preceding the holiday season. Product innovations, new product launches and the size and timing of orders from the Company’s customers may also result in variability. 2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and include the Company’s consolidated domestic and international subsidiaries. Certain information and disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly, these unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. All dollar amounts (other than per share amounts) in the following discussion are in millions of United States (“U.S.”) dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents funds that are not readily available for general purpose cash needs due to contractual limitations. Restricted cash is classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had restricted cash of $ 31.5  and $ 30.5 , respectively, included in Restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Restricted cash balance as of December 31, 2022 primarily provides collateral for certain bank guarantees on rent, customs and duty accounts and also consists of collections on factored receivables that remain unremitted to the factor as of December 31, 2022.
Restricted cash is included as a component of Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Equity Investments The Company elected the fair value option to account for its investment in Rainbow JVCO LTD and subsidiaries (together, "Wella" or the “Wella Company”) to align with the Company’s strategy for this investment. The fair value is updated on a quarterly basis. The investment is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the fair value of the investment using a combination of the income approach, the market approach and private transactions, when applicable. Changes in the fair value of equity investment under the fair value option are recorded in Other income, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 8—Equity Investments). Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, the net realizable value of inventory, the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities associated with acquisitions, the fair value of equity investments, the
9 Table of Contents assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment and income taxes. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods. Tax Information The effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was  13.8 % and  16.0 %, respectively, and
22.4 % and
25.1 %, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to foreign exchange loss recognized on the current year repatriation of funds that were previously taxed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the larger nondeductible executive stock compensation in the prior period. The effective income tax rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to the effect of (i) jurisdictions with different statutory rates, (ii) adjustments to the Company’s unrealized tax benefits (“UTBs”) and accrued interest, (iii) non-deductible expenses, (iv) audit settlements and (v) valuation allowance changes. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the gross amount of UTBs was $ 237.9  and $ 251.6 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount of UTBs that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate is $ 156.8 . As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the liability associated with UTBs, including accrued interest and penalties, was $ 184.6  and $ 191.8 , respectively, which was recorded in Income and other taxes payable and Other noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total interest and penalties recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to UTBs was $ 0.1  and $( 1.0 ) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 1.4
and $( 0.3 ) for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total gross accrued interest and penalties recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was $ 27.8
and $ 26.4 , respectively. On the basis of the information available as of December 31, 2022, it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $ 7.5  in UTBs may occur within twelve months as a result of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and a potential lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations. Russia Market Exit In connection with the Company’s Board of Director’s decision to wind down operations in Russia, the Company recognized total pre-tax gains in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of $ 16.8
and $ 15.7 , respectively, in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. These amounts are primarily related to a bad debt accrual release due to better than expected collections.
The Company incurred
nil
of income tax charges associated with the decision to exit Russia in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. The Company anticipates incurring up to $ 8.0
of additional costs through completion of the wind down. Additionally, management anticipates derecognizing the cumulative translation adjustment balance pertaining to the Russian subsidiary. The Company has substantially completed its commercial activities in Russia. However, the Company anticipates that the process related to the liquidation of the Russian legal entity will take an extended period of time.
Lacoste Fragrances License Termination On December 19, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Lacoste S.A.S, Sporloisirs S.A., and Lacoste Alligator S.A., (collectively, “Lacoste”) to early terminate the existing Lacoste fragrances licensing agreement, effective June 30, 2023.

million (approximately $ 55.6 ). The amount advanced to the Company has been reflected as deferred income, within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, until the termination effective date, June 30, 2023.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06,
Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The Company adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective method in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 10 Table of Contents In July 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-05,
Leases (Topic 842): Lessors-Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments , which requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease on the commencement date of the lease if specified criteria are met.

SEGMENT REPORTING Operating and reportable segments (referred to as “segments”) reflect the way the Company is managed and for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has designated its Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") as the CODM. Certain income and shared costs and the results of corporate initiatives are managed by Corporate. Corporate primarily includes stock compensation expense, restructuring and realignment costs, costs related to acquisition, divestiture and license termination activities, and impairments of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangibles that are not attributable to ongoing operating activities of the segments. Corporate costs are not used by the CODM to measure the underlying performance of the segments. With the exception of goodwill, the Company does not identify or monitor assets by segment. The Company does not present assets by reportable segment since various assets are shared between reportable segments. The allocation of goodwill by segment is presented in Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net. 11 Table of Contents Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, SEGMENT DATA 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net revenues: Prestige $ 957.7   $ 1,008.0   $ 1,821.2   $ 1,878.7   Consumer Beauty 565.9   570.2   1,092.4   1,071.2   Total $ 1,523.6   $ 1,578.2   $ 2,913.6   $ 2,949.9   Operating income (loss): Prestige 164.4   141.6   335.0   273.7   Consumer Beauty 49.4   43.3   81.1   54.7   Corporate ( 14.5 ) 59.1   ( 44.9 ) ( 67.2 ) Total $ 199.3   $ 244.0   $ 371.2   $ 261.2   Reconciliation: Operating income 199.3   244.0   371.2   261.2   Interest expense, net 61.0   60.9   126.9   120.7   Other income, net ( 141.9 ) ( 126.2 ) ( 240.1 ) ( 512.3 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 280.2   $ 309.3   $ 484.4   $ 652.8   Presented below are the percentage of revenues associated with the Company’s product categories: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, PRODUCT CATEGORY 2022 2021 2022 2021 Fragrance 62.2   % 62.7   % 60.8   % 61.3   % Color Cosmetics 25.6   26.0   26.6   27.1   Body Care & Other 7.9   7.1   7.8   6.9   Skincare 4.3   4.2   4.8   4.7   Total 100.0   % 100.0   % 100.0   % 100.0   % 5.

of the net proceeds to pay down its 2018 Coty Term A and B Facilities on a pro rata basis and reserved a maximum of $ 500.0
for reinvestment in the business, as defined in the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement, as amended, ("the Reinvestment Balance"). As a result of the prepayments, the outstanding balances of the 2018 Coty Term A and B Facilities were reduced by $ 1,135.7
and $ 879.8 , respectively. On September 30, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement to permanently reduce the existing 2018 Coty Revolving Credit Facility by $ 700.0
and add a new class of incremental revolving facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $ 700.0
that matures on April 5, 2025 (the "September 2021 Coty Revolving Credit Facility"). On November 30, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement that established a new class of senior secured revolving credit facility of $ 2,000.0
maturing on April 5, 2025 (the "2021 Coty Revolving Credit Facility"), which refinanced and replaced the 2018 Coty Revolving Credit Facility due April 5, 2023 and the September 2021 Coty Revolving Credit Facility due April 5, 2025 (the "2021 Revolver Refinancing").

In October 2021 and January 2022, the Company completed the sale of certain real estate holdings, and in accordance with the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement, as amended, the Company utilized the proceeds from the sale to pay down a portion of the outstanding balances of the 2018 Coty Term A Facility and 2018 Coty Term B Facility. As a result of the October 2021 prepayments, the outstanding principal balances of the 2018 Coty Term A Facility and the U.S. dollar portion of the 2018 Coty Term B Facility were reduced by € 6.2
million (approximately $ 7.2 ) and $ 91.9 , respectively.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuations through its global operations. The Company may reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative instruments and also by designating foreign currency denominated borrowings and cross-currency swaps as hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company expects that through hedging, any gain or loss on the derivative instruments would generally offset the expected increase or decrease in the value of the underlying forecasted transactions. In September 2019, the Company entered into cross-currency swap contracts in the notional amount of $ 550.0
and designated these cross-currency swaps as hedges of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.
In September 2020, the Company terminated its existing net investment cross currency swap derivatives in exchange for cash payment of $ 37.6 . The related loss from this termination is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI/(L)”) until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the notional amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges were $ 27.9
and $ 30.0 , respectively. The Company also uses certain derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge intercompany transactions and foreign currency denominated external debt. Although these derivatives were not designated for hedge accounting, the overall objective of mitigating foreign currency exposure is the same for all derivative instruments. For derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recorded in the line item in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the derivative relates. As of
24 Table of Contents December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the notional amounts of these outstanding non-designated foreign currency forward and cross currency forward contracts were $ 2,106.7
and $ 2,403.8 , respectively. Interest Rate Risk The Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations related to its variable rate debt instruments. The Company may reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the cash flows associated with changes in the variable interest rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts. The interest rate swap contracts result in recognizing a fixed interest rate for the portion of the Company’s variable rate debt that was hedged. This will reduce the negative and positive impact of increases in the variable rates over the term of the contracts. Hedge effectiveness of interest rate swap contracts is based on a long-haul hypothetical derivative methodology and includes all changes in value.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had interest rate swap contracts designated as effective hedges in the notional amount of $ 800.0 . These interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and were highly effective. Net Investment Hedge Foreign currency gains and losses on borrowings designated as a net investment hedge, except ineffective portions, are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment (“CTA”) component of AOCI/(L), along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the nominal exposures of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as net investment hedges were € 650.4  million and € 289.0  million, respectively. The designated hedge amounts were considered highly effective. Forward Repurchase Contracts In June and December 2022, the Company entered into certain forward repurchase contracts to start hedging for potential $ 200.0
and $ 196.0
share buyback programs, in 2024 and 2025, respectively. These forward repurchase contracts are accounted for at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other expense (income), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 15—Equity and Convertible Preferred Stock.
Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments which are designated as hedging instruments:
The accumulated gain on foreign currency borrowings classified as net investment hedges in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI/(L) was $ 5.0
and $ 41.7
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The accumulated loss on derivative instruments classified as net investment hedges in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI/(L) was $( 37.6 ) as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The amount of gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the Company’s derivative and non-derivative financial instruments which are designated as hedging instruments is presented below: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Foreign exchange forward contracts $ ( 0.4 ) $ —   $ 1.3   $ 1.7   Interest rate swap contracts 0.1   2.5   1.8   1.9   Net investment hedges ( 31.4 ) 2.2   ( 36.7 ) 18.9   The accumulated gain on derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges in AOCI/(L), net of tax, was $ 1.3

of its Class A Common Stock (the “Incremental Repurchase Program”). Repurchases may be made from time to time at the Company’s discretion, based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the business, the market price of its Class A Common Stock, and general market conditions. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did
no t repurchase any shares of its Class A Common Stock under the Incremental Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had authority for $ 396.8
remaining under the Incremental Repurchase Program. In June and December 2022, the Company entered into forward repurchase contracts (the “Forward” and together the “Forwards”) with three large financial institutions (“Counterparties”) to start hedging for potential $ 200.0
and $ 196.0
share buyback programs in 2024 and 2025, respectively. In connection with the June and December 2022 Forward transactions, the Company incurred certain execution fees of $ 2.0
and $ 2.0 , respectively, which were recognized as a premium to the forward price recorded at inception and amortized ratably over the contract periods. As part of the Forward agreements, the Company will pay interest on the outstanding underlying notional amount of the Forwards held by the Counterparties during the contract periods. The interest rates are variable, based on the United States secured overnight funding rate (“SOFR”) plus a spread. The weighted average interest rate plus applicable spread for the June and December 2022 Forward transactions were
7.5 % and
8.0 %, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. As part of the June 2022 Forward transaction, two of the Counterparties purchased approximately
27.0  million shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. In addition, as part of the December 2022 Forward transaction, these two Counterparties purchased approximately
6.7  million shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The June and December 2022 Forward agreements require the Company to: (i) repurchase the shares on or before June 6, 2024 and December 15, 2024, respectively, at a price based on the weighted average of the daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) during the initial acquisition period (“Initial Price”); or (ii) at the Company’s option, pay or receive the difference between the Final Price, defined as the weighted average of the daily VWAP during the unwind period as defined in the agreement, and Initial Price of the Forwards. As part of the December 2022 Forward transaction, the remaining Counterparty purchased approximately
5.6  million shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. This Forward requires the Company to pay or receive the difference between the Final Price and Initial Price established at inception of the Forward on or before January 15, 2025. In addition, the Forwards include a provision for a potential true-up in cash upon specified changes in the price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock relative to the Initial Price (“Hedge Valuation Adjustment”). Such Hedge Valuation
27 Table of Contents Adjustment shall not result in a termination date or any adjustment of the number of Coty’s Class A Common Stock shares purchased by the Counterparties at inception. In the event the Company declares and pays any cash dividends on its Class A Common Stock, the Forward Counterparties will be entitled to such dividend payments and payable at termination of the Forwards. Since the Forwards permit a net cash settlement alternative in addition to the physical settlement, the Company accounted for the Forwards initially and subsequently at their fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Dividends On April 29, 2020, the Board of Directors suspended the payment of dividends.
The change in dividends accrued recorded to APIC in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 was $ 0.1 , which represent dividends no longer expected to vest as a result of forfeitures of outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”). In addition to the activity noted above, the Company made a payment of $ 0.7 , of which $ 0.2
relates to tax, for the previously accrued dividends on RSUs that vested during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Total accrued dividends on unvested RSUs and phantom units of $ 1.0
and $ 0.1
are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022.

Diluted EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under the Company's equity compensation plans, the convertible Series B Preferred Stock, and the Forward Repurchase Contracts. When calculating any potential dilutive effect of stock options, Series A Preferred Stock, restricted stock and RSUs, the Company uses the treasury method and the if-converted method for the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock and the Forward Repurchase Contracts.
The treasury method typically does not adjust the net income attributable to Coty Inc., while the if-converted method requires an adjustment to reverse the impact of the preferred stock dividends of $ 3.3
and $ 68.7 , and to reverse the impact of fair market value (gains)/losses for contracts with the option to settle in shares or cash of $( 44.3 ) and $ 0.0 , respectively, if dilutive, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 on net income applicable to common stockholders during the period. The if-converted method requires an adjustment to reverse the impact of the preferred stock dividends of $ 6.6
and $ 191.7 , and to reverse the impact of fair market value (gains)/losses for contracts with the option to settle in shares or cash of $( 6.8 ) and $ 0.0 , respectively, if dilutive, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 on net income applicable to common stockholders during the period. 18.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal Matters The Company is involved, from time to time, in various litigation, administrative and other legal proceedings, including regulatory actions, incidental or related to its business, including consumer class or collective actions, personal injury (including asbestos claims related to the Company’s talc-based cosmetic products), intellectual property, competition, compliance and advertising claims litigation and disputes, among others (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”). While the Company cannot predict any final outcomes relating thereto, management believes that the outcome of current Legal Proceedings will not have a material effect upon its business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the trading price of the Company’s securities. However, management’s assessment of the Company’s current Legal Proceedings is ongoing, and could change in light of the discovery of additional facts with respect to Legal Proceedings not presently known to the Company, further legal analysis, or determinations by judges, arbitrators, juries or other finders of fact or deciders of law which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the probable liability or outcome of such Legal Proceedings. From time to time, the Company is in discussions with regulators, including discussions initiated by the Company, about actual or potential violations of law in order to remediate or mitigate associated legal or compliance risks and liabilities or penalties. As the outcomes of such proceedings are unpredictable, the Company can give no assurance that the results of any such proceedings will not materially affect its reputation, business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the trading price of its securities. Certain Litigation . A consolidated stockholder class and derivative action (the “Tender Offer Litigation”) concerning the tender offer by JAB Beauty B.V. (the “Cottage Tender Offer”) and the Schedule 14D-9 is pending against certain current and former directors of the Company, JAB Holding Company S.à r.l., JAB Holdings B.V., JAB Cosmetics B.V., and JAB Beauty B.V. in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The Company was named as a nominal defendant. The case, which was filed on May 6, 2019, was captioned Massachusetts Laborers’ Pension Fund v. Harf et al., Case No. 2019-0336-AGB. On June 14, 2019, plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed a Verified Amended Class Action and Derivative Complaint (“Amended Complaint”). After defendants responded to the Amended Complaint, on October 21, 2019, plaintiffs filed a Verified Second Amended Class Action and Derivative Complaint (the “Second Amended Complaint”), alleging that the directors and JAB Holding Company S.à r.l., JAB Holdings B.V., JAB Cosmetics B.V., and JAB Beauty B.V. breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders and breached the Stockholders Agreement. The Second Amended Complaint seeks, among other things, monetary relief. On November 21, 2019, the defendants moved to dismiss certain claims asserted in the Second Amended Complaint, and certain of the director defendants also answered the complaint. On May 7, 2020, plaintiffs stipulated
31 Table of Contents to the dismissal without prejudice of JAB Holding Company S.à r.l. from the action. On August 17, 2020, the court denied the remaining motions to dismiss. As of October 17, 2022, the parties to the Tender Offer Litigation have reached an agreement in principle to resolve the matter, which is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. At this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance, that may result given the current status of these lawsuits. Brazilian Tax Assessments The Company’s Brazilian subsidiaries receive tax assessments from local, state and federal tax authorities in Brazil from time to time. Current open tax assessments as of December 31, 2022 are: Assessment received Type of assessment Type of Tax Tax period impacted Estimated amount, including interest and penalties as of

million (approximately $ 39.3 ) Jun-21 State sales tax, which the Treasury Office of the State of Goiás considers as improperly calculated ICMS 2016-2020 R$ 82.0
million (approximately $ 15.5 ) All cases are currently in the administrative process. The Company is seeking favorable administrative decisions on the tax enforcement actions filed by the tax authorities for these assessments. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and it has not recognized a loss for these assessments as the Company does not believe a loss is probable. Due to the fiscal environment in Brazil, the possibility of further tax assessments related to the same or similar matters cannot be ruled out. 20.

25.9 % of the Wella Company as an equity investment and performs certain services to Wella. Refer to Note 8— Equity Investments. In connection with the sale of the Wella Business, the Company and Wella entered into a Transitional Services Agreement (“TSA”). Subject to the terms of this TSA, the Company will perform services for Wella in exchange for related service fees. Such services include billing and collecting from Wella customers, certain logistics and warehouse services, as well as other administrative and systems support. The Company and Wella have mutually agreed to end the contracted TSA services on January 31, 2022. The Company and Wella have also entered into other manufacturing and distribution arrangements to facilitate the Wella Business transition in the U.S. and Brazil. TSA fees and other fees earned were $ 0.7
and $ 2.0 , respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $ 37.1
and $ 1.6 , respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. TSA fees and other fees earned were $ 1.5
and $ 4.1 , respectively, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and $ 70.3
and $ 3.1 , respectively, for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The TSA fees are principally invoiced on a cost plus basis. The TSA fees and other fees were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Cost of sales, respectively, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
32 Table of Contents The Company also entered into an agreement with Wella to provide management, consulting and financial services to Wella and its direct and indirect divisions, subsidiaries, parent entities and controlled affiliates (in assisting it in the management of its business).

In accordance with the separation agreement with Wella, Coty shall retain and be solely responsible for any amounts payable to former Coty employees transferred to Wella (“Wella employees”), who participated in the Coty Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Wella employees will continue to participate and vest on the current terms for the remaining vesting period after the separation. As such, Coty will continue to recognize the share-based compensation expense for Wella employees until the existing equity awards reach their vesting date. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Coty recorded $ 1.0
and $( 3.0 ), respectively, and $ 2.7
and $( 1.4 ) of share-based compensation expense (income) related to Wella employees, which was presented as part of Other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

All forward-looking statements made in this document are qualified by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this document, and we do not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by applicable law, to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. Industry, Ranking and Market Data Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q concerning our industry and the markets in which we operate, including our general expectations about our industry, market position, market opportunity and market sizes, is based on data from various sources including internal data and estimates as well as third-party sources widely available to the public, such as independent industry publications, government publications, reports by market research firms or other published independent sources and on our assumptions based on that data and other similar sources. We did not fund and are not otherwise affiliated with the third-party sources that we cite. Industry publications and other published sources generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from third-party sources believed to be reliable. Internal data and estimates are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which we operate and management’s understanding of industry conditions, and such information has not been verified by any independent sources. These data involve a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. While we generally believe the market, industry and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be the most recently available and to be reliable, such information is inherently imprecise and we have not independently verified any third-party information or verified that more recent information is not available. Our fiscal year ends on June 30. Unless otherwise noted, any reference to a year preceded by the word “fiscal” refers to the fiscal year ended June 30 of that year. For example, references to “fiscal 2023” refer to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Any reference to a year not preceded by “fiscal” refers to a calendar year. OVERVIEW We are one of the world’s largest beauty companies, with an iconic portfolio of brands across fragrance, color cosmetics, and skin and body care. Through targeted strategic transactions, we have strengthened and diversified our presence across the countries, categories and channels in which we compete, building a strong beauty platform. As we transform the Company, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities, including stabilizing and growing our Consumer Beauty brands through leading innovation and improved execution, accelerating our Prestige fragrance business and ongoing expansion into Prestige cosmetics, building a comprehensive skincare portfolio leveraging existing brands, enhancing our e-commerce and Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”) capabilities, expanding our presence in China through Prestige products and select Consumer Beauty brands, and establishing Coty as an industry leader in sustainability. We remain attentive to economic and geopolitical conditions that may materially impact our business. We continue to explore and implement risk mitigation strategies in the face of these unfolding conditions and remain agile in adapting to changing circumstances. Such conditions have or may have global implications which may impact the future performance of our business in unpredictable ways.
Our operations outside of the United States account for a significant portion of our revenues and expenses. As a result, a substantial portion of our total revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Exchange rates between certain of these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may have a significant impact our operating results. During the first half of fiscal 2023, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain other foreign currencies – such as the euro and British pound – reduced our
37 Table of Contents reported revenue and expenses, principally related to cost of sales, controllable fixed costs, and advertising and consumer promotional costs. Refer to Part I, Item 1A under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, for a discussion of these factors and other risks. We expect that our net revenue for fiscal year 2023 will grow in the mid-to high single digits versus the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the Russia exit . Global Supply Chain Challenges We continue to experience global supply chain challenges resulting from industry-wide component shortages and transportation delays. These challenges have negatively impacted order fill rates across our product categories, particularly prestige fragrances where there has been demand growth, especially in North America and certain European countries. We continue to take steps to improve order fill rates and mitigate the impact of these constraints, including working closely with our suppliers to ensure the availability of components such as glass and metal, and building our inventory levels to meet demand. However, we expect these challenges to continue into the remainder of the fiscal year 2023. Inflation Inflationary trends in certain markets and global supply chain challenges may negatively affect our sales and operating performance. We continued to experience the impact of inflation on material, logistical and other costs during the first half of fiscal 2023. The combination of our strategy to premiumize the portfolio, cost savings programs, and recent pricing actions are enabling us to offset inflationary pressure on costs. We currently anticipate the impact of inflation to continue into the second half fiscal of 2023. We will continue to implement mitigation strategies and price increases to offset these trends; however, such measures may not fully offset the impact to our operating performance. After the resumption of more typical business conditions, the economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products will continue to impact the timing of our sales and operating performance each period.
Russia-Ukraine War We continue to wind down the operations of our Russian subsidiary. In connection with our wind down, we liquidated a portion of our remaining inventory in Russia, in accordance with applicable sanctions, during the first half of fiscal 2023. We anticipate incurring up to $8.0 of additional costs through completion of the wind down, and future net cash costs of $30.0 to $35.0, which will be funded by our Russian subsidiary. Additionally, management anticipates derecognizing the cumulative translation adjustment balance pertaining to the Russian subsidiary. The amount of future costs, including cash costs, will be subject to various factors, such as additional government regulation and the resolution of legal contingencies. We have substantially completed our commercial activities in Russia. However, we anticipate that the process related to the liquidation of the Russian legal entity will take an extended period of time.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures for continuing operations and Coty Inc. including Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss), and Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Coty Inc. to common stockholders (collectively, the “Adjusted Performance Measures”). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the beauty industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Despite the limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures, our management uses the Adjusted Performance Measures as key metrics in the evaluation of our performance and annual budgets and to benchmark performance of our business against our competitors. The following are examples of how these Adjusted Performance Measures are utilized by our management: • strategic plans and annual budgets are prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; • senior management receives a monthly analysis comparing budget to actual operating results that is prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; and • senior management’s annual compensation is calculated, in part, by using some of the Adjusted Performance Measures. In addition, our financial covenant compliance calculations under our debt agreements are substantially derived from these Adjusted Performance Measures. 38 Table of Contents Our management believes that Adjusted Performance Measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of the Company. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions we routinely receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, our management has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. The Adjusted Performance Measures exclude the impact of certain items (as further described below) and provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance. By disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures, our management intends to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We provide disclosure of the effects of these non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding measure prepared in conformity with GAAP in our financial statements, and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure so that investors may understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and use the information to perform their own analyses. Adjusted operating income/Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations excludes restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs, amortization, acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts, stock-based compensation, and asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. For adjusted EBITDA, in addition to the preceding, we exclude adjusted depreciation as defined below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions, and implement divestitures of components of our business, and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally, Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense items and preferred stock deemed dividends, as described below, and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period-to-period. Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: • Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: We have excluded acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. Additionally, for divestitures, we exclude write-offs of assets that are no longer recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures, and the maturities of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past transactions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions or divestitures. • Restructuring and other business realignment costs: We have excluded costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures, our management is able to further evaluate our ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. • Asset impairment charges: We have excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. • Amortization expense: We have excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.
• Costs related to market exit: We have excluded the impact of direct incremental costs related to our decision to wind down our business operations in Russia. We believe that these direct and incremental costs are inconsistent and infrequent in nature. Consequently, our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. 39 Table of Contents • Gains on sale of real estate: We have excluded the impact of Gains on sale of real estate as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. • Stock-based compensation: Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we have excluded the effect of these expenses from the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA. This is due to their primarily non-cash nature; in addition, the amount and timing of these expenses may be highly variable and unpredictable, which may negatively affect comparability between periods. • Depreciation and Adjusted depreciation: Our adjusted operating income excludes the impact of accelerated depreciation for certain restructuring projects that affect the expected useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment, as such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further, we have excluded adjusted depreciation, which represents depreciation expense net of accelerated depreciation charges, from our adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. • Other (income) expense: We have excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and pension settlements as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further, we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella, as our management believes these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying ongoing business, and the adjustment of such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. We have excluded the gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred Stock. Such transactions do not reflect our operating results and we have excluded the impact as our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. • Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant noncontrolling interest percentage. • Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally, adjustments are made for the tax impact of any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities. • Deemed Preferred Stock Dividends: We have excluded preferred stock deemed dividends related to the First Exchange and the Second Exchange (as disclosed and defined in Note 13—Equity Investments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022) from our calculation of adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. These deemed dividends are nonmonetary in nature, the transactions were entered into to simplify our capital structure and do not reflect our underlying ongoing business. Management believes that this adjustment helps investors and others compare and analyze our performance from period to period. While acquiring brands and licenses comprises a part of our overall growth strategy, along with targeting organic growth opportunities, we have excluded acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and the amount and frequency are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Our management assesses the success of an acquisition as a component of performance using a variety of indicators depending on the size and nature of the acquisition, including:
• the scale of the combined company by evaluating consolidated and segment financial metrics; • the expansion of product offerings by evaluating segment, brand, and geographic performance and the respective strength of the brands; • the evaluation of share expansion in categories and geographies; • the earnings per share accretion and substantial incremental free cash flow generation providing financial flexibility for us; and • the comparison of actual and projected results, including achievement of projected synergies, post integration; provided that timing for any such comparison will depend on the size and complexity of the acquisition. 40 Table of Contents Constant Currency We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented in “constant currency”, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information we present may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Basis of Presentation of Acquisitions, Divestitures and Terminations During the period when we complete an acquisition, divestiture or early license termination, the financial results of the current year period are not comparable to the financial results presented in the prior year period. When explaining such changes from period to period and to maintain a consistent basis between periods, we exclude the financial contribution of: (i) the acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results and (ii) the divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands, to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period. There are no acquisitions, divestitures or early license terminations in the comparable periods that would impact the comparability of financial results between periods presented in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AS COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021
NET REVENUES
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, net revenues decreased 3%, or $54.6, to $1,523.6 from $1,578.2 in the three months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 7%, and a decrease in unit volume of 5%, partially offset by a positive price and mix impact of 9%. The overall decrease in net revenues reflects a decline in the Prestige fragrance category due to the negative foreign currency exchange translation impact, market exit from Russia, and component constraints. Additionally, there was a decline in net revenues in the makeup category, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19 related declines in Asia Pacific travel and lockdowns in China. Despite the overall decline in net revenues for the Prestige segment, the segment benefited from the continued success of fragrance brands, such as
Marc Jacobs
and
Burberry . Additionally, there was growth in travel retail sales for the Americas and Europe due to increased leisure travel in the period. The Consumer Beauty segment remained relatively flat, benefiting from the continued success of the body care and skincare brands. Additionally, foreign exchange headwinds negatively impacted net revenues significantly, primarily affecting the euro and British pound. The overall change in net revenues was impacted by our ongoing market exit from Russia, resulting in an approximate 2% negative net impact on our net revenues in the current quarter, including an approximate 3% negative net impact on our Prestige business net revenues.

This decrease in net revenues primarily reflects:
41 Table of Contents (i) lower net revenues for the
Lacoste
brand in the current quarter, which was primarily due to our market exit from Russia and supply chain constraints; (ii) lower net revenues in the Prestige makeup category impacted by a decline in
Gucci
travel retail sales in the Asia Pacific region as a result of the lockdowns in China; and (iii) lower net revenues related to
Hugo Boss
and
Gucci
primarily due to the negative foreign currency exchange translation impact, mainly attributable to the euro, despite the positive impact from pricing and from successful innovation in the
Boss Bottled
and
Gucci Flora
fragrances. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by:
(i) the continued success and growth of prestige fragrances, specifically
Marc Jacobs Daisy, Burberry Hero
and
Burberry Her;
and (ii) an increase in net revenues due to positive pricing impact as a result of global price increases and an overall premiumization strategy. Consumer Beauty In the three months ended December 31, 2022, net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment decreased 1%, or $4.3, to $565.9 from $570.2 in the three months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 7%, a decrease in unit volume of 5%, partially offset by positive price and mix impact of 11%. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflects: (i) a decline in net revenues from fragrance and color cosmetics categories, despite an overall positive impact from pricing, as a result of negative foreign currency exchange translation impacts which had a significant impact on net sales in these categories.
These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by: (i) an increase in net revenues from the skin and body care brands in Brazil due to strong category momentum and market share gains, and positive pricing impact and product mix, as well as due to innovation in brands such as
Monange ; (ii) an increase in net revenues for
CoverGirl
driven by category growth in the U.S. as well as higher sell out resulting in lower returns and markdowns compared to the prior year; and
(iii) an increase in net revenues due to price increases across the Consumer Beauty product portfolio. COST OF SALES In the three months ended December 31, 2022, cost of sales decreased 6%, or $35.8, to $525.3 from $561.1 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 34.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 35.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a gross margin increase of approximately 110 basis points, primarily reflecting:
(i) approximately 190 basis points related to positive price impact across our product portfolio;
(ii) approximately 60 basis points in decreased excess and obsolescence costs;
(iii) approximately 60 basis points related to designer license fees due to favorable royalty related activity, as well as the impact of our licensed brand sales comprising a lower portion of overall net sales compared to the comparative period; (iv) approximately 40 basis points due to lower returns and markdown costs for the Consumer Beauty division as a result of higher sell through compared to the prior year period and lower returns volume for products in the Prestige division primarily in the US market; and (v) approximately 20 basis points related to a favorable impact on variable costs due to increased manufacturing efficiencies, improvements in productivity as well as procurement and material cost optimization. These increases were partially offset by: (i) approximately 240 basis points related to product mix impact associated with increased contribution from lower margin Consumer Beauty products primarily in Brazil; and (ii) approximately 20 basis points related to increased freight costs. 42 Table of Contents Included in the above is the negative impact of inflation on material and freight costs of approximately 130 basis points, which benefited temporarily from the timing of cost increases in certain materials.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In the three months ended December 31, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%, or $35.4, to $754.3 from $718.9 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 49.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 45.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2021, or approximately 390 basis points. This increase primarily reflects:
(i) 540 basis points due to a gain on sale of real estate that was recorded in the comparative period;
(ii) 150 basis points due to unfavorable transactional impact from our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations; and (iii) 40 basis points due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense as a percentage of net revenues principally due to awards granted in the second quarter. These increases were partially offset by the following decreases: (i) 210 basis points due to decrease in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenue primarily related to a reduction of working media costs in the period due to an adjustment to the level of spend due to the constrained availability of Prestige fragrances due to the component shortages; (ii) 80 basis points due to a decrease in bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues; (iii) 30 basis points due to a decrease in administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues due to a decrease in compensation related to a reduction in bonus expense; and (iv) 20 basis points due to a decrease in logistics costs as a percentage of net revenues. OPERATING INCOME In the three months ended December 31, 2022, operating income was $199.3 compared to income of $244.0 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues, decreased to 13.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to an operating income as a percentage of net revenues of 15.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decline in operating margin is primarily driven by a gain on the sale of real estate recognized in the comparative period, partially offset by a decrease in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues, and a decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Change % Operating income (loss) Prestige $ 164.4  $ 141.6  16  % Consumer Beauty 49.4  43.3  14  % Corporate (14.5) 59.1  <(100%) Total $ 199.3   $ 244.0   (18) % Prestige
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, operating income for Prestige was $164.4 compared to income of $141.6 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating margin increased to 17.2% of net revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 14.0% in the three months ended December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues, a decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues and a decrease in fixed costs, partially offset by unfavorable transactional impact from our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. 43 Table of Contents Consumer Beauty In the three months ended December 31, 2022, operating income for Consumer Beauty was $49.4 compared to income of $43.3 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating margin increased to 8.7% of net revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 7.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues and lower fixed costs, partially offset by unfavorable transactional impact from our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations and an increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues. Corporate Corporate primarily includes income and expenses not directly relating to our operating activities. These items are included in Corporate since we consider them to be Corporate responsibilities, and these items are not used by our management to measure the underlying performance of the segments. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, the operating loss for Corporate was $14.5 compared to an income of $59.1 in the three months ended December 31, 2021, as described under “Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) for Continuing Operations” below. The increase in the operating loss for Corporate was primarily driven by a gain on the sale of real estate recognized in the comparative period, higher stock compensation expense, partially offset by a gain recognized related to our market exit from Russia.

In the three months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted EBITDA increased $5.7 to $317.6 from $311.9 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 20.8% of net revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 19.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of revenues, lower cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues, and lower fixed costs, partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense. Amortization Expense
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, amortization expense decreased to $47.6 from $51.4 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, amortization expense of $37.3 and $10.3 was reported in the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, respectively. In the three months ended December 31, 2021, amortization expense of $40.4 and $11.0 was reported in the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by certain license agreements and product formulations, which were fully amortized in the prior year. Restructuring and Other Business Realignment Costs We continue to analyze our cost structure, including opportunities to simplify and optimize operations. In connection with the four-year Turnaround plan announced on July 1, 2019 to drive substantial improvement and optimization in our business, we have and expect to continue to incur restructuring and other business realignment costs. On May 11, 2020, we announced an expansion of the Turnaround Plan to further reduce fixed costs, the Transformation Plan. We incurred $507.6 of cash costs life-to-date as of December 31, 2022, which have been recorded in Corporate. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a credit in restructuring and other business structure realignment costs of $(2.9), as follows: • We incurred a credit in restructuring costs of $(2.9) primarily related to the Transformation Plan changes in estimates, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations; and • We incurred no business structure realignment costs.
In the three months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a credit in restructuring and other business structure realignment costs of $(1.8) as follows: 45 Table of Contents • We incurred a credit in restructuring costs of $(4.1) primarily related to the Transformation Plan, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations; and • We incurred business structure realignment costs of $2.3 primarily related to the Transformation Plan and certain other programs. This amount includes $(0.3) reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses, and $2.6 reported in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. In all reported periods, all restructuring and other business realignment costs were reported in Corporate.
Stock-Based Compensation In the three months ended December 31, 2022, stock-based compensation was $34.2 as compared with $27.5 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in stock-based compensation is primarily related to awards granted in the second quarter. In the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, all costs related to stock-based compensation were reported in Corporate. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities In the three months ended December 31, 2022 we incurred no costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities.
In the three months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $6.9 of costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities. These costs were primarily associated with the Wella Transaction. In all reported periods, all costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities were reported in Corporate. Gain on Sale of Real Estate In the
three months ended December 31, 2022, we did not recognize any gain related to sale of real estate. In the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized gain of $91.7 related to sale of real estate. Gain Related to Market Exit In the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of $16.8 related to our market exit from Russia which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the three months ended December 31, 2021, we did not incur any market exit costs. Adjusted Depreciation Expense In the three months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted depreciation expense of $26.8 and $29.4 was reported in the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, respectively. In the three months ended December 31, 2021, adjusted depreciation expense of $37.0 and $38.6 was reported in the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, respectively. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, net interest expense was $61.0 as compared with $60.9 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. This relatively flat change in interest expense reflects a higher average interest on lower debt balances in the current period. OTHER INCOME
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, other income was $141.9 as compared with other income of $126.2 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase in income is principally due to an increase in income due to a fair value adjustment for our forward repurchase contracts, partially offset by a less favorable fair value adjustment related to our investment in the Wella Company compared to the prior period. INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 13.8% and 16.0%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, is primarily due to foreign exchange loss recognized on the current year repatriation of funds that were previously taxed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the larger nondeductible executive stock compensation in the period. 46 Table of Contents The effective income tax rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to the effect of (i) jurisdictions with different statutory rates, (ii) adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest, (iii) non-deductible expenses, (iv) audit settlements and (v) valuation allowance changes. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates.

In preparing the calculation, each adjustment to reported income is first analyzed to determine if the adjustment has an income tax consequence. The provision for taxes is then calculated based on the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are incurred, multiplied by the respective statutory rates and offset by the increase or reversal of any valuation allowances commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability. (c) The amount represents the realized and unrealized (gain) loss recognized for the change in fair value of the investment in Wella. (d) For the three months ended December 31, 2022, this primarily represents adjustments for equity loss from KKW. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, this primarily represents a net gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred Stock closed on October 20, 2021. The adjusted effective tax rate was 25.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 9.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The differences were primarily due to a benefit of $18.8 in the prior period recognized on the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets due to a tax rate increase enacted in the Netherlands. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COTY INC. Net income attributable to Coty Inc. was $238.3 in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net income of $261.4 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the income is primarily driven by the lower unrealized gain in the Wella investment and lower operating income, partially offset by a decrease in tax provision in the current period. We believe that adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. provides an enhanced understanding of our performance.

NET REVENUES In the six months ended December 31, 2022, net revenues decreased 1%, or $36.3, to $2,913.6 from $2,949.9 in the six months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 7%, and a decrease in unit volume of 2%, partially offset by a positive price and mix impact of 8%. The overall decrease in net revenues reflects a decline in Prestige makeup, which was negatively impacted by the lockdowns in China, a decline in the fragrances, due to lack of innovation in key fragrance brands, such as
Tiffany , the exit from Russia, and fragrance component constraints. Despite the overall decline in net revenues for the Prestige segment, the segment benefited from the continued success of fragrance brands, such as
Gucci,
Burberry,
Chloe
and
Marc Jacobs . Additionally, there was growth in travel retail sales due to increased leisure travel in the period. The Consumer Beauty segment experienced positive performance across the body care and skincare brands primarily in Brazil. The overall increase in net revenues reflects the successful implementation of global price increases across all product categories, our product premiumization strategy, and positive overall market trends. Foreign exchange headwinds, however, negatively impacted net revenues significantly, primarily affecting the euro and British pound transactions. The overall change in net revenues was impacted by our ongoing exit from Russia, resulting in an approximate 2% negative net impact on our net revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022, including an approximate 2% negative net impact on our Prestige business net revenues.

due to less innovation in the current fiscal period, the impact of the lockdowns in China and our market exit from Russia; and iv. lower net revenues related to
Hugo Boss
due to the negative foreign currency exchange translation impact, mainly impacting euro denominated sales, despite the positive impact due to pricing and innovation in the
Boss Bottled
fragrance. These decreases in net revenue were partially offset by: (i) higher net revenues due to the continued success of Prestige fragrances, such as
Gucci Flora, Burberry Hero and Her ,
Chloe Atelier des Fleurs
and
Marc Jacobs Daisy. Consumer Beauty In the six months ended December 31, 2022, net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment increased 2%, or $21.2, to $1,092.4 from $1,071.2 in the six months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting a positive price and mix impact of 10%, partially offset by a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 7%, and a decrease in unit volume of 1%. The increase in net revenues primarily reflects:
(i) an increase in net revenues from the skin and body care brands in Brazil, which had an increase in net revenue due to strong category momentum and market share gains, and positive pricing impact and product mix, as well as due to innovation in brands such as
Monange ; 49 Table of Contents (ii) an increase in net revenues for
CoverGirl
driven by category growth in the U.S. as well as higher sell out resulting in lower returns and markdowns compared to the prior year; and (iii) an increase in net revenues due to price increases across the Consumer Beauty product portfolio. These increases in net revenue were partially offset by: (i) the continued decline in net revenues for
Sally Hansen
products, resulting from the continued decline for demand for at-home nail care compared to the prior year where COVID-19 restrictions had resulted in fewer nail salon visits and positively impacted the nail category and the brand's net revenue in the prior year; and (ii) a decline in net revenues from fragrance and color cosmetics categories, despite an overall positive impact from pricing, as a result of negative foreign currency exchange translation impacts which had a significant impact on net revenues in these categories. COST OF SALES
In the six months ended December 31, 2022, cost of sales decreased 4%, or $39.3, to $1,026.6 from $1,065.9 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 35.2% in the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 36.1% in the six months ended December 31, 2021 resulting in a gross margin increase of approximately 90 basis points primarily reflecting:
(i) approximately 140 basis points related to positive price impact across our product portfolio;
(ii) approximately 50 basis points due to lower returns and markdown costs for the Consumer Beauty division as a result of higher sell through compared to the prior year period and lower returns volume for products in the Prestige division primarily in the US and Latin American markets; (iii) approximately 40 basis points related to designer license fees due to favorable royalty related activity, as well as the impact of our licensed brand sales comprising a lower portion of overall net sales compared to the comparative period; (iv) approximately 30 basis points related to a favorable impact on variable costs due to increased manufacturing efficiencies, improvements in productivity as well as procurement and material cost optimization; and (v) approximately 10 basis points related to lower excess and obsolescence costs. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) approximately 150 basis points related to product mix impact due to a higher portion of consolidated sales being from the Consumer Beauty division; and (ii) approximately 30 basis points related to higher freight costs. Included in the above is the negative impact of inflation on material and freight costs of approximately 160 basis points.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In the six months ended December 31, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5%, or $70.2, to $1,425.0 from $1,495.2 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 48.9% in the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 50.7% in the six months ended December 31, 2021, or approximately 180 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to:
(i) 240 basis points due to a decrease in stock-based compensation cost primarily related to a reduction in expense recognized in connection with a prior year's grant made to the CEO; (ii) 180 basis points due to a decrease in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenue primarily related to a reduction of non-working and working media in the first half of the year due to an adjustment to the level of spend due to the constrained availability of Prestige fragrances due to the component shortages; (iii) 60 basis points due to a decrease in bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues; (iv) 20 basis points due to a decrease in administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues due to a decrease in compensation related to a reduction in employee headcount; and (v) 20 basis points due to a decrease in logistics costs as a percentage of net revenues. These decreases were partially offset by the following increases: 50 Table of Contents (i) 270 basis points due to a gain on sale of real estate was recorded in the comparative period, partially offset by an accrual reversal associated with the resolution of a contingency in the current period; and (ii) 70 basis points due to unfavorable transactional impact from our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. OPERATING INCOME In the six months ended December 31, 2022, operating income was $371.2 compared to income of $261.2 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Operating margin as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 12.7% in the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to an operating income as a percentage of net revenues of 8.9% in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The improved operating margin is largely driven by a decrease in stock compensation expense, a decrease in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues, a decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues and a decrease in fixed costs, partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate recognized in the comparative period. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment

In the six months ended December 31, 2022, operating income for Prestige was $335.0 compared to income of $273.7 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Operating margin increased to 18.4% of net revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 14.6% in the six months ended December 31, 2021, driven primarily by a decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues, a decrease in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues, a decrease in fixed costs and a decrease in amortization expense. Consumer Beauty In the six months ended December 31, 2022, operating income for Consumer Beauty was $81.1 compared to income of $54.7 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Operating margin increased to 7.4% of net revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 5.1% in the six months ended December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues, a decrease in fixed costs, and a decrease in amortization expense, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact and an increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues. Corporate Corporate primarily includes corporate expenses not directly related to our operating activities. These items are included in Corporate since we consider them to be Corporate responsibilities, and these items are not used by our management to measure the underlying performance of the segments. In the six months ended December 31, 2022, the operating loss for Corporate was $44.9 compared to a loss of $67.2 in the six months ended December 31, 2021, as described under “Adjusted Operating Income for Coty Inc.” below. The decrease to the operating loss for Corporate was primarily driven by the a gain on the sale of real estate recognized in the comparative period, a decrease in stock compensation expense, and a decrease in costs related to acquisitions and divestiture activities, partially offset by a gain recognized related to our market exit from Russia. 51 Table of Contents Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) by Segment We believe that Adjusted Operating income (loss) by segment further enhances an investor’s understanding of our performance.

Adjusted operating margin increased to 17.5% of net revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 14.8% in the six months ended December 31, 2021. In the six months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted EBITDA increased $35.1 to $625.5 from $590.4 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 21.5% of net revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 20.0% in the six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a decrease in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues, a decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues and a decrease in fixed costs. Amortization Expense In the six months ended December 31, 2022, amortization expense decreased to $94.9 from $108.4 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. In the six months ended December 31, 2022, amortization expense of $74.3 and $20.6 was reported in the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, respectively. In the six months ended December 31, 2021, amortization expense of $85.4 and $23.0 was reported in the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by certain license agreements and product formulations, which were fully amortized in the prior year. Restructuring and Other Business Realignment Costs
We continue to analyze our cost structure, including opportunities to simplify and optimize operations. In connection with the four-year Turnaround plan announced on July 1, 2019 to drive substantial improvement and optimization in our business, we have and expect to continue to incur restructuring and other business realignment costs. On May 11, 2020 we announced an expansion of the Turnaround Plan to further reduce fixed costs, the Transformation Plan. We incurred $507.6 of cash costs life-to-date as of December 31, 2022, which have been recorded in Corporate.
In the six months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a credit in restructuring and other business structure realignment costs of $(3.7), as follows: • We incurred a credit in restructuring costs of $(4.1) primarily related to the Transformation Plan, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. • We incurred business structure realignment costs of $0.4 primarily related to our Transformation plan and certain other programs. This amount includes $0.9 reported in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and a credit of $(0.5) reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In the six months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred restructuring and other business structure realignment costs of $13.3 as follows: • We incurred restructuring costs of $8.3 primarily related to the Transformation Plan, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. • We incurred business structure realignment costs of $5.0 primarily related to our Transformation Plan. This amount includes $(0.3) reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses, and $5.3 reported in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. In all reported periods, all restructuring and other business realignment costs were reported in Corporate. Stock-based compensation In the six months ended December 31, 2022, stock-based compensation was $65.3 as compared with $135.7 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in stock-based compensation is primarily related to a reduction in expense recognized in connection with a prior year's grant made to the CEO. In all reported periods, all costs related to stock-based compensation were reported in Corporate. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities
In the six months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred no costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities.
In the six months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $10.9 of cost relating to acquisition and divestiture activities. These costs were primarily associated with the Wella Transaction. In all reported periods, all costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities were reported in Corporate. Gain on Sale of Real Estate In the six months ended December 31, 2022 we recognized a gain of $1.0 related to sale of real estate. In the six months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a gain of $92.7 related to sale of real estate. 53 Table of Contents In all reported periods, all gains related to sale of real estate were reported in Corporate. Gain Related to Market Exit In the six months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of $15.7 related to our market exit from Russia which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the six months ended December 31, 2021, we did not incur any market exit costs. Adjusted depreciation expense In the six months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted depreciation expense of $54.3 and $60.2 was reported in the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, respectively. In the six months ended December 31, 2021, adjusted depreciation expense of $75.0 and $78.6 was reported in the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, respectively. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET In the six months ended December 31, 2022, net interest expense was $126.9 as compared with $120.7 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. This increase is primarily due to the impact of a higher average interest rate despite lower debt balances in the current period.
OTHER INCOME In the six months ended December 31, 2022, other income was $240.1 as compared to other income of $512.3 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is primarily due to a less favorable fair value adjustment related to our investment in the Wella Company compared to the prior period, partially offset by the favorable change in the fair value adjustment for our forward repurchase contracts. INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 22.4% and 25.1%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior period is primarily due to foreign exchange loss recognized on the current year repatriation of funds that were previously taxed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the larger nondeductible executive stock compensation in the prior period. The effective income tax rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to the effect of: (i) jurisdictions with different statutory rates, (ii) adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest; (iii) non-deductible expenses, (iv) audit settlements and (v) valuation allowance changes. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates.

For the six months ended December 31, 2021, this primarily represents a net gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred Stock closed on October 20, 2021. The adjusted effective tax rate was 26.8% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 18.2% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The differences were primarily due to a benefit of $18.8 in the prior period recognized on the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets due to a tax rate increase enacted in the Netherlands. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COTY INC. Net income attributable to Coty Inc. was $366.9 in the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net income of $487.4 in the six months ended December 31, 2021. This decrease in net income was primarily driven by a smaller favorable adjustment related to the realized and unrealized gain in the Wella investment in the current year, partially offset by higher operating income and a decrease in tax provision in the current period. We believe that adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. provides an enhanced understanding of our performance.

Accordingly, we did not reverse the impact of the fair market value (gain) for contracts with the option to settle in shares or cash of ($6.8). For the six months ended December 31, 2022, as the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock was dilutive, an adjustment to reverse the impact of the preferred stock dividends of $6.6 was required.

FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview
Our primary sources of funds include cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings from issuance of debt and lines of credit provided by banks and lenders in the U.S. and abroad. Our cash flows are subject to seasonal variation throughout the year, including demands on cash made during our first fiscal quarter in anticipation of higher global sales during the second fiscal quarter and strong cash generation in the second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand by retailers associated with the holiday season. Our principal uses of cash are to fund planned operating expenditures, capital expenditures, business structure realignment expenditures, interest payments, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and any principal payments on debt. Working capital movements are influenced by the sourcing of materials related to the production of products. Cash and working capital management initiatives, including the phasing of vendor payments and factoring of trade receivables from time-to-time, may also impact the timing and amount of our operating cash flows.
We remain focused on deleveraging our balance sheet using cash flows generated from our operations. We continue to take steps to permanently reduce our debt, in order to reduce interest costs and improve our long term profitability and cash flows. In addition, our 25.9% investment in Wella gives us the opportunity for further permanent debt reductions, if and when our equity position is divested. Variable rate debt accounts for 31% of our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022. We incurred higher average variable interest rates compared to the same period in the prior year, and we expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal 2023. Higher long-term interest rates are expected to increase interest expense on our variable-rate outstanding debt. We use derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts to reduce cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in variable interest rates. In the near term, certain of these interest rate swap contracts will expire and, if not replaced, this may have a negative impact on our cash flows in an economic environment with increasing variable interest rates. Currently, 63% of our variable rate debt is hedged using interest rate swap contracts.
We continue to wind down the operations of our Russian subsidiary. We anticipate incurring up to $8.0 of additional costs through completion of the wind down, and future net cash costs of $30.0 to $35.0, which will be funded by our Russian subsidiary. The amount of future costs, including cash costs, will be subject to various factors, such as additional government regulation and the resolution of legal contingencies. We have substantially completed our commercial activities in Russia. However, we anticipate that the process related to the liquidation of the Russian legal entity will take an extended period of time.
We continue to experience inflationary pressures in most markets resulting in higher commodity and supply chain costs, including material, freight, and energy costs. Further, inflationary trends in certain markets and global supply chain challenges, including component shortage, may negatively affect our future sales and operating performance. Supply chain constraints may impact the availability of raw materials used to manufacture our products which may negatively impact our ability to meet customer demands, thereby impacting our cash flows and profitability. Debt During the second quarter, we completed cash tender offers and redeemed $77.0 of our 2026 Dollar Notes and €69.7 million (approximately $72.2) of our 2026 Euro Notes. In addition, we early terminated a fragrance license and a portion of the termination payment totaling €52.5 million (approximately $55.6) was advanced to us. In accordance with the requirements of our debt agreements, we used a portion of the advance proceeds, totaling $35.8, to pay down outstanding
56 Table of Contents principal balances under the 2018 Coty Term B Facility. See Note 11—Debt in the notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt arrangements and prior period credit agreements, as well as definitions of capitalized terms. Factoring of Receivables From time to time, we supplement the timing of our cash flows through the factoring of trade receivables. In this regard, we have entered into factoring arrangements with financial institutions. The net amount utilized under the factoring facilities was $199.9 and $179.3 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The aggregate amount of trade receivable invoices factored on a worldwide basis amounted to $795.8 and $597.9 during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash Flows Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 645.4  $ 734.7  Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (45.2) 74.5  Net cash used in financing activities (536.6) (547.5) Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $645.4 and $734.7 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $89.3 was primarily driven by higher net cash outflows from changes in working capital accounts despite an increase in cash related net income. The higher cash outflows from working capital accounts was driven by changes in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which reflects a decrease in level of accrual activity in the current year due to the sale of Wella and the timing of payments during both periods. The increase in cash related net income reflects the impact of lower costs as a percentage of net revenue during the current period compared to prior period. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities was $(45.2) and $74.5 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities of $119.7 was mainly attributable to higher inflows in the prior year from sales of long term assets and higher outflows related to timing of capital expenditure projects in the current year. Proceeds from fees for the termination of a license agreement in the current year were greater than the prior period collection of contingent consideration from discontinued operations and partially offset the overall higher cash outflows from investing activities year over year. Net cash used in financing activities Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $536.6 and $547.5, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities of $10.9 was driven mainly by higher cash outflows during the six months ended December 31, 2021 for dividend payments on Series B Preferred Stock and deferred financing fees largely offset by higher cash payments in the current year for realized losses on the settlement of foreign currency contracts. Debt related activities in both the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included net paydowns of debt which were flat year over year. Dividends On April 29, 2020, our Board of Directors suspended the payment of dividends, in keeping with our 2018 Coty Credit Agreement, as amended. As we focus on preserving cash, we expect to suspend the payment of dividends until we reach a Net debt to Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) of 2x. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 57 Table of Contents Dividends on the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock are payable in cash, or by increasing the amount of accrued dividends on Convertible Series B Preferred Stock, or any combination thereof, at the sole discretion of the Company. We started paying dividends on the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock in cash for the period ended June 30, 2021, and we expect to continue to pay such dividends in cash on a quarterly basis, subject to the declaration thereof by our Board of Directors. The terms of the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock restrict our ability to declare cash dividends on our common stock until all accrued dividends on the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in cash.

In relation to the appeal of our Brazilian tax assessments, we have entered into surety bonds of R$423.8 million (approximately $80.2) as of December 31, 2022. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had undrawn letters of credit of $13.6 and $14.3 and bank guarantees of $17.8 and $17.2 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Contractual Obligations
Our principal contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2022 are summarized in Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations and Commitments,” of our Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business. Critical Accounting Policies We believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: • Revenue Recognition; • Equity Investments; • Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets; • Business Combinations; • Inventory; and • Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes to the items disclosed as critical accounting policies and estimates in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II—Item 7 of our Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See Note 14—Derivative Instruments for updates to our foreign currency risk management and interest rate risk management.

Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) and our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the second fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO and CFO, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Part II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
