Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of Pyxus International, Inc. (the "Company", "Pyxus", "we", or "us") and all companies that Pyxus directly or indirectly controls, either through majority ownership or otherwise. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the normal and recurring adjustments necessary for fair statement of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented have been included. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 filed on June 14, 2022. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, the results of operations for a fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be attained for other quarters or a full fiscal year. Segment Information During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company reevaluated its operating and reportable segments under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280 -
Segment Reporting . As a result of this reevaluation, effective as of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the Company has
eight
operating segments organized by geographic area and product category that are aggregated into
one
reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Leaf. Based on our reevaluation, the Company concluded that the economic characteristics of our
five
Leaf region operations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa were similar. Each geographic region derives its revenues mainly from shipping processed tobacco to manufacturers of cigarettes and other consumer tobacco products around the world, with a smaller percentage of revenue in each region being derived from performing third-party tobacco processing services. The
three
product category operating segments other than Leaf do not individually or in the aggregate meet the quantitative and qualitative thresholds to be individually reportable and have been combined and reported in the "All Other" category for purposes of reconciliation of respective balances for the Leaf segment to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Prior-period segment financial information has been revised to conform to the current-year presentation. See " Note 20. Segment Information " for additional information. Reclassifications The prior-period amount for goodwill impairment has been reclassified from other expense (income), net to conform to the current-year presentation. 2.
New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In November 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2021-10,
Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance . This ASU created ASC Topic 832,
Government Assistance , and requires certain information be disclosed regarding assistance received from a government entity when either a grant or contribution accounting model is applied. The new disclosures are required for annual periods for transactions with a government entity that are within the scope of the Topic. The new disclosure guidance was adopted prospectively and became effective for the Company on April 1, 2022. The adoption of this new accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's annual disclosures for fiscal year 2023. 3.
Revenue Recognition Product revenue is primarily processed tobacco sold to the customer. Processing and other revenues are mainly contracts to process customer-owned green tobacco. During processing, ownership remains with the customers. All Other revenue is primarily composed of revenue from the sale of e-liquids and non-tobacco agriculture products. The following disaggregates sales and other operating revenues by major source, with the All Other category being included for purposes of reconciliation of the respective balances below of the Leaf segment (the Company's sole reportable segment) to the condensed consolidated financial statements: 10 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Leaf: Product revenue $ 625,129   $ 394,823   $ 1,423,612   $ 1,064,280   Processing and other revenues 27,128   31,301   75,212   82,657   Total sales and other operating revenues 652,257   426,124   1,498,824   1,146,937   All Other: Total sales and other operating revenues 3,296   2,818   8,912   9,496   Total sales and other operating revenues $ 655,553   $ 428,942   $ 1,507,736   $ 1,156,433   The following summarizes activity in the allowance for expected credit losses: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ ( 23,698 ) $ ( 23,641 ) $ ( 24,541 ) $ ( 20,900 ) Additions ( 593 ) ( 251 ) ( 1,618 ) ( 3,139 ) Write-offs 201   —   2,069   147   Balance, end of period ( 24,090 ) ( 23,892 ) ( 24,090 ) ( 23,892 ) Trade receivables 230,081   213,103   230,081   213,103   Trade receivables, net $ 205,991   $ 189,211   $ 205,991   $ 189,211   4.
Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges The Company continued its focus on cost saving initiatives. The employee separation and asset impairment charges for the periods ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to the restructuring of certain non-leaf agriculture operations. The employee separation and asset impairment charges for the periods ended December 31, 2021 were primarily related to the write-off of the Company's remaining industrial hemp cannabidiol ("CBD") extraction equipment and the continued restructuring of certain leaf operations.
The following summarizes the Company's restructuring and asset impairment charges: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Employee separation charges $ 35   $ 510   $ 345   $ 1,913   Asset impairment and other non-cash charges —   50   4,035   5,739   Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 35   $ 560   $ 4,380   $ 7,652   5.
Income Taxes The Company's quarterly provision for income taxes has generally been calculated using the annual effective tax rate method ("AETR method"), which applies an estimated annual effective tax rate to pre-tax income or loss. The AETR method was used to calculate the provision for income taxes for the prior fiscal years, for which the Company reported income tax benefits in each prior reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, the AETR method produced an unreliable estimate of the Company’s annual effective tax rate; therefore, the Company recorded its interim income tax provision using the discrete method, as allowed under ASC 740-270,
Income Taxes - Interim Reporting . Using the discrete method, the Company determined current and deferred income tax expense as if the nine-month interim period of the current fiscal year were an annual period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was ( 119.9 )% and ( 19.1 )%, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the difference between the Company’s effective rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0% is primarily due to the impact of net foreign exchange effects, non-deductible interest, and variations in the expected jurisdictional mix of earnings. 11 6.

CCAA Proceeding and Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries On January 21, 2021, Figr Norfolk Inc. ("Figr Norfolk"), Figr Brands, Inc. ("Figr Brands"), and Canada’s Island Garden Inc. ("Figr East," and together with Figr Norfolk and Figr Brands, the "Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries"), which, prior to their disposition, were indirect subsidiaries of the Company, applied for relief from their respective creditors pursuant to Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the "CCAA") in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the "Canadian Court") in Ontario, Canada as Court File No. CV-21-00655373-00CL (the "CCAA Proceeding"). On January 21, 2021 (the "Order Date"), upon application by the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, the Canadian Court issued an order for creditor protection of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions of the CCAA and the appointment of FTI Consulting Canada Inc. to serve as the Canadian Court-appointed monitor of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries during the pendency of the CCAA Proceeding (the "Monitor"). The administration of the CCAA Proceeding, including the Canadian Court's appointment of the Monitor and the related authority of the Monitor, including approval rights with respect to significant actions of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries during the pendency of the CCAA Proceeding, resulted in the Company losing control (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries at that time, and the deconsolidation on January 20, 2021 of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries' assets and liabilities and elimination of their equity components from the Company's consolidated financial statements as of January 21, 2021. Prior to the deconsolidation of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, they comprised an operating segment within the Other Products and Services reportable segment, which upon the Company's reevaluation of operating and reportable segments effective during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 is presented in the All Other category. Upon deconsolidation, the Company accounts for its investments in the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting.
On January 29, 2021, the Canadian Court issued an order permitting the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries to initiate a sale and investment solicitation process to be conducted by the Monitor and its affiliate to solicit interest in, and opportunities for, a sale of, or investment in, all or substantially all, or one or more components, of the assets and/or the business operations of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. On January 28, 2022, a sale of the assets of Figr Norfolk for a purchase price of Cdn.$ 5,000
was completed. On June 28, 2021, a sale of the outstanding equity of Figr East and certain intangible assets of Figr Brands for an aggregate purchase price of Cdn.$ 24,750
was completed. On February 2, 2022, Figr Norfolk and Figr Brands obtained approval to make cash distributions to their creditors pursuant to a distribution protocol approved by the Canadian Court. In the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company received $ 2,011
in settlement of its debt claims with respect to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries and did not receive any recovery with respect to its equity interest in the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. On April 21, 2022, Figr Norfolk and Figr Brands obtained approval from the Canadian Court to terminate the CCAA Proceedings and commence bankruptcy proceedings under Canada's Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the "BIA Proceedings") to complete certain corporate and tax-related wind-up activities. On May 13, 2022, Figr Norfolk and Figr Brands commenced the BIA Proceedings. On June 13, 2022, the CCAA Proceedings were formally terminated. 12 Related Party Relationship The commencement of the CCAA Proceeding, the appointment of the Monitor, and the subsequent deconsolidation of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries results in transactions with the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries no longer being eliminated in consolidation. As such, transactions between the Company and the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, including loans under the debtor-in-possession financing facility (the "Canadian DIP Facility") from another non-U.S. subsidiary of Pyxus (the "DIP Lender") provided during the pendency of the CCAA Proceedings, which were fully repaid on July 8, 2021, are treated as related party transactions. See " Note 19. Related Party Transactions " for transactions between the Company and the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. 9.

Interest was required to be paid in arrears in cash upon prepayment, acceleration, maturity, and on the last day of each interest period (which may be one, three or six months) for SOFR loans and on the last day of each calendar quarter for loans that are not SOFR loans. Pursuant to the DDTL Credit Agreement, the DDTL Loan Lenders received on the DDTL Amendment and Restatement Effectiveness Date a non-refundable commitment fee equal to

Contingencies and Other Information Brazilian Tax Credits The government in the Brazilian State of Parana ("Parana") issued a tax assessment on October 26, 2007 with respect to local intrastate trade tax credits that result primarily from tobacco transferred between states within Brazil. At December 31, 2022, the assessment for intrastate trade tax credits taken is $ 2,524
and the total assessment including penalties and interest is $ 9,689 . On March 18, 2014, the government in Brazilian State of Santa Catarina also issued a tax assessment with respect to local intrastate trade tax credits that result primarily from tobacco transferred between states within Brazil. At December 31, 2022, the assessment for intrastate trade tax credits taken is $ 2,184
and the total assessment including penalties and interest is $ 6,151 . The Company believes it has properly complied with Brazilian law and will contest any assessment through the judicial process. Should the Company lose in the judicial process, the loss of the intrastate trade tax credits would have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company. The Company also has local intrastate trade tax credits in the Brazil State of Rio Grande do Sul. This jurisdiction permits the sale or transfer of excess credits to third parties, however approval must be obtained from the tax authorities. The Company has an agreement with the state government regarding the amounts and timing of credits that can be sold. The tax credits have a
20 carrying value of $ 13,535 . The intrastate trade tax credits are monitored for impairment in future periods based on market conditions and the Company’s ability to use or sell the tax credits. Other Matters In addition to the above-mentioned matters, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in other litigation or legal matters incidental to their business activities, including tax matters. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, they are being vigorously defended and the Company does not currently expect that any of them will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial position. However, should one or more of these matters be resolved in a manner adverse to its current expectation, the effect on the Company’s results of operations for a particular fiscal reporting period could be material. 19.

Guarantees and Collateral The obligations of Pyxus Holdings under the New Secured Debt are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, Pyxus Parent and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries and certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations (the "New Secured Debt Obligors"). In addition, under the New Intabex Credit Facility, Intabex and Alliance One International Tabak B.V. (which were obligors under the DDTL Facility Loans) also guarantee the New Intabex Credit Facility (together, the "Specified Intabex Obligors") but do not guarantee the New Notes, the New Pyxus Loans or the ABL Credit Agreement.
In addition, certain assets of the Specified Intabex Obligors (which were pledged as collateral for the DDTL Facility Loans) are pledged as collateral to secure the New Intabex Loans (the "Intabex Collateral") but do not secure the New Notes, the New Pyxus Loans or the ABL Credit Agreement. The New Secured Debt is secured by (i) a first-priority lien on substantially all assets of the New Secured Debt Obligors other than certain exclusions and certain collateral for which obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are secured on a first-priority basis (the "ABL Priority Collateral") and (ii) a second-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral. The New Intabex Loans are further secured by a first-priority lien on the Intabex Collateral.
The New Secured Debt shares a single lien, held by Alter Domus, as senior collateral agent (the "Senior Collateral Agent"), on the Collateral (excluding the Intabex Collateral) subject to the payment waterfall pursuant to the intercreditor arrangements described below. Intercreditor and Collateral Agency Agreement
On the Settlement Date, the New Secured Debt Obligors, together with the representative for the holders of the New Secured Debt and the Senior Collateral Agent, entered into the Intercreditor and Collateral Agency Agreement, dated as of February 6, 2023 (the "Intercreditor and Collateral Agency Agreement"), pursuant to which the Senior Collateral Agent, serves as joint collateral agent for the benefit of the holders of the New Notes, the New Pyxus Loans and the New Intabex Loans with respect to all common collateral securing such indebtedness (the "Collateral"; which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes Intabex Collateral).
The Intercreditor and Collateral Agency Agreement provides that any Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with or upon the exercise of any secured creditor remedies will be distributed (subject to the provisions described in the next paragraph) first to holders of the New Notes and the New Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and then to holders of any future junior debt secured by such Collateral on a pro rata basis (and in each case permitted refinancing indebtedness thereof).
Exercise of rights and remedies against the Collateral and certain rights in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding (including the right to object to debtor-in-possession financing or to credit bid) by the Senior Collateral Agent will be controlled first by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the New Term Loans (including, in any event, each holder holding at least 20% of
25 the New Term Loans as of the Settlement Date, provided such holder holds at least 15% of the New Term Loans as of the date of determination), second, after repayment in full of the New Term Loans, by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the New Notes and last, after repayment in full of the New Term Loans and the New Notes, by holders of a majority in principal amount of any future junior debt secured by the Collateral. Any such future junior debt will be subject to certain customary waivers of rights in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding in favor of the Senior Collateral Agent, including, but not limited to, with respect to debtor-in-possession financing, adequate protection and credit bidding.
Limited Consent and Amendment to ABL Credit Agreement On January 5, 2023, Pyxus Holdings entered into the Limited Consent and Amendment to the ABL Credit Agreement (the "ABL Amendment"), which became effective concurrently with the consummation of the Exchange Transactions on the Settlement Date and which among other things, (i) permits the incurrence of the New Secured Debt and the related liens and priorities and the Exchange Transactions, to the extent applicable, and (ii) modifies certain covenants to be substantially consistent with those governing the New Secured Debt.

These statements also may be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. These risks and uncertainties include those discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties include: our reliance on a small number of significant customers; continued vertical integration by our customers; global shifts in sourcing customer requirements; shifts in the global supply and demand position for tobacco products; variation in our financial results due to growing conditions, customer indications and other factors; loss of confidence in us by our customers, farmers and other suppliers; migration of suppliers who have historically grown tobacco and from whom we have purchased tobacco toward growing other crops; risks related to our advancement of inputs to tobacco suppliers to be settled upon the suppliers delivering us unprocessed tobacco at the end of the growing season; risks that the tobacco we purchase directly from suppliers will not meet our customers’ quality and quantity requirements; weather and other environmental conditions that can affect the marketability of our inventory; international business risks, including unsettled political conditions, uncertainty in the enforcement of legal obligations, including the collection of accounts receivable, fraud risks, expropriation, import and export restrictions, exchange controls, inflationary economies, currency risks and risks related to the restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries; many of our operations are located in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; impacts of international sanctions on our ability to sell or source tobacco in certain regions; exposure to foreign tax regimes in which the rules are not clear, are not consistently applied and are subject to sudden change; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates; competition with the other primary global independent leaf tobacco merchant and independent leaf merchants; disruption, failure or security breaches of our information technology systems; continued high inflation; we have identified material weaknesses related to our internal controls in certain prior years, and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future; regulations regarding environmental matters; risks related to our capital structure, including risks related to our significant debt and our ability to continue to finance our non-U.S. local operations with uncommitted short-term operating credit lines at the local level; our ability to continue to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing; potential failure of foreign banks in which our subsidiaries maintain deposits or the failure by such banks to transfer funds or honor withdrawals; the risk that, because our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, we may be unable to generate the significant amount of cash required to service our indebtedness; our ability to refinance our current credit facilities at the same availability or at similar interest rates; failure to achieve our stated goals, which may adversely affect our liquidity; developments with respect to our liquidity needs and sources of liquidity; the volatility and disruption of global credit markets; failure by counterparties to derivative transactions to perform their obligations; increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from governments, as well as other stakeholders such as investors and customers, with respect to our environmental, social and governance policies, including sustainability policies; inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation facing our e-liquids business if its products are alleged to have caused significant loss, injury, or death; certain shareholders have the ability to exercise controlling influence on various corporate matters; reductions in demand for consumer tobacco products; risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its related shipping constraints, labor shortages and supply-chain impacts; legislative and regulatory initiatives that may reduce consumption of consumer tobacco products and demand for our services and increase regulatory burdens on us or our customers; government actions that significantly affect the sourcing of tobacco, including governmental actions to identify and assess crop diversification initiatives and alternatives to leaf tobacco growing in countries whose economies depend upon tobacco production; governmental investigations into, and litigation concerning, leaf tobacco industry buying and other payment practices; and impact of potential regulations to prohibit the sale of cigarettes in the United States other than low-nicotine cigarettes.
We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that we may make from time to time. Executive Summary During the nine months ended December 31, 2023, we successfully utilized our global footprint to navigate the current tobacco supply shortage to meet our buying targets for fiscal 2023 in most markets. Combined with continuing normalization of shipping schedules in North and South America and increasing demand from Asia, the Company delivered an increase of more than 50% in sales and other operating revenues year-over-year in spite of a complicated crop year that was exacerbated by La Nina and inflationary pressures. This increase in sales and other operating revenues and higher utilization of the Company’s
27 securitization programs resulted in increased cash flow from operations year-over-year. Some of these funds were strategically utilized to fully repay the Company’s outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility and provides the Company with increased financial flexibility as we approach the next buying cycle.
In February 2023, the Company successfully completed an exchange of its existing long-term debt with varying maturity dates for new long-term debt with maturity dates in 2027. Our new capital structure addresses approaching maturity dates, provides the Company with increased financial flexibility, and relief from certain restrictive covenants.

$226.7 million , or 52.9%. This increase was primarily due t o a
21.9%
increase in leaf volume and a
29.8%
increase in average price per kilo. The increase in leaf volume was driven by increased volume from Asia, more normalized timing of shipments from South America from the current crop, and the timing of shipments from North America that were delayed from the three months ended September 30, 2022 into the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in average price per kilo was mainly due to higher tobacco prices. Cost of goods and services sold were
$363.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and
$567.8 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an
increase of
$204.1 million, or 56.1%.
This increase was mainly due to the increase in sales and other operating revenues. Average cost per kilo increased primarily due to higher tobacco prices. Gross profit was
$65.2 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and
$87.8 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of
$22.6 million, or 34.7%.
This increase was mainly due to the increase in sales and other operating revenues. Gross profit as a percent of sales went from 15.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 13.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of short-crops in certain markets in Africa and product mix in North America. Average gross profit per kilo for product revenue was $0.55 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and $0.64 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $0.09 per kilo or 16.4%. This increase was primarily due to customer mix in North and South America and product mix in Africa and Asia.
Other expense, net was
$0.2 million of income f or the three months ended December 31, 2021 and
$9.0 million
of expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of
$9.2 million. This increase was primarily due to higher utilization of securitization facilities. Operating income was $30.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and $41.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $11.4 million, or 37.7%. This increase was mainly due to higher leaf sales and other operating revenues from increased volume and average price per kilo and was partially offset by higher other expense, net, which was primarily due to
higher utilization of securitization facilities . Income tax expense was $31.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and $17.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $13.9 million, or 43.7%. The decrease was driven by the Company utilizing a different method for estimating tax expense for the period ended December 31, 2022. Using the discrete method for the period ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined current and deferred income tax expense as if the nine-month interim period of the current fiscal year were an annual period, which resulted in the recognition of the fiscal 2023 year-to-date expense in the quarter.

Income Taxes " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 30 Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Nine Months Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except per kilo amounts) 2022 2021 $ % Sales and other operating revenues $ 1,507.7  $ 1,156.4  351.3  30.4  Cost of goods and services sold 1,311.9  997.0  314.9  31.6  Gross profit 195.9  159.4  36.5  22.9  Gross profit as a percent of sales 13.0  % 13.8  % Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 106.7  $ 106.0  0.7  0.7  Other expense, net 9.1  1.5  7.6  506.7  Restructuring and asset impairment charges 4.4  7.7  (3.3) (42.9) Goodwill impairment —  0.4  (0.4) (100.0) Operating income 75.7  43.9  31.8  72.4  Loss on deconsolidation/disposition of subsidiaries 0.6  9.5  (8.9) (93.7) Loss on pension settlement 2.6  —  2.6  100.0  Interest expense, net 85.6  82.8  2.8  3.4  Income tax expense 15.8  9.2  6.6  71.7  Income from unconsolidated affiliates 10.7  6.0  4.7  78.3  Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.2  (0.4) 0.6  150.0  Net loss attributable to Pyxus International, Inc. $ (18.5) $ (51.3) 32.8  63.9  Leaf: Sales and other operating revenues $ 1,423.6  $ 1,064.3  359.3  33.8  Tobacco costs 1,164.8  858.3  306.5  35.7  Transportation, storage, and other period costs 77.8  63.5  14.4  22.6  Total cost of goods sold 1,242.7  921.8  320.9  34.8  Product revenue gross profit 181.0  142.5  38.4  27.0  Product revenue gross profit as a percent of sales 12.7  % 13.4  % Kilos sold 302.9  261.6  41.3  15.8  Average price per kilo $ 4.70  $ 4.07  0.63  15.5  Average cost per kilo 4.10  3.52  0.58  16.5  Average gross profit per kilo 0.60  0.55  0.05  9.1  Processing and other revenues $ 75.2  $ 82.7  (7.4) (9.0) Processing and other revenues costs of services sold 56.1  59.2  (3.2) (5.3) Processing and other gross profit 19.1  23.4  (4.3) (18.3) Processing and other gross profit as a percent of sales 25.4  % 28.4  % All Other: Sales and other operating revenues $ 8.9  $ 9.5  (0.6) (6.1) Cost of goods and services sold 13.1  16.1  (2.9) (18.2) Gross loss (4.2) (6.6) 2.3  35.7  Gross loss as a percent of sales (47.3) % (69.0) % Note: dollar and percentage changes may not calculate exactly due to rounding 31 Sales and other operating revenues were $1,156.4 million for the

Refer to See " Note 5. Income Taxes " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings under our foreign seasonal lines of credit, availability under ABL Credit Facility, and cash collections from our securitized receivables. Our liquidity requirements are affected by various factors from our core tobacco leaf business, including crop seasonality, foreign currency and interest rates, green tobacco prices, customer mix, crop size, and quality. Our leaf tobacco business is seasonal, and purchasing, processing, and selling activities have several associated peaks where cash on-hand and outstanding indebtedness may vary significantly compared to year end. The first three quarters of our fiscal year generally represent the peak of our working capital requirements.
We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs for the next twelve months. During such time our liquidity needs for operations may approach the levels of our anticipated available cash and permitted borrowings under our credit facilities. Unanticipated developments affecting our liquidity needs, including with respect to the foregoing factors, and sources of liquidity, including impacts affecting our cash flows from operations and the availability of capital resources (including an inability to renew or refinance seasonal lines of credit), may result in a deficiency in liquidity. To address a potential liquidity deficiency, we may undertake plans to minimize cash outflows, which could include exiting operations that do not generate positive cash flow. It is possible that, depending on the occurrence of events affecting our liquidity needs and sources of liquidity, such plans may not be sufficient to adequately or timely address a liquidity deficiency. 32 Debt Financing We continue to finance our business with a combination of short-term and long-term credit lines, the long-term debt securities, advances from customers, and cash from operations when available. See " Note 12. Debt Arrangements " and " Note 21. Subsequent Events " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for a summary of our short-term and long-term debt. We continuously monitor and, as available, adjust funding sources as needed to enhance and drive various business opportunities. From time to time we may take steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. Such actions could include prepayments, open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other redemptions or retirements of outstanding debt, and refinancing of debt. The amount of prepayments or the amount of debt that may be repurchased, refinanced, or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants, and other considerations.
The following summarizes our total borrowing capacity at December 31, 2022 and 2021 under our short-term and long-term credit lines and letter of credit facilities and the remaining available amount after the reduction for outstanding borrowings and amounts reserved for outstanding letters of credit: December 31, 2022 (in millions) Total Borrowing Capacity Remaining Amount Available ABL Credit Facility $ 100.0  $ 100.0  Foreign seasonal lines of credit 711.2  218.9  Other long-term debt 0.6  0.1  Letters of credit 18.4  4.1  Total $ 830.2  $ 323.1  December 31, 2021 (in millions) Total Borrowing Capacity Remaining Amount Available ABL Credit Facility $ 75.0  $ 22.5  Foreign seasonal lines of credit 619.5  235.2  Other long-term debt 2.5  0.6  Letters of credit 12.9  3.4  Total $ 709.9  $ 261.7  33 Net Debt We refer to "Net debt," a non-GAAP measure, as total debt liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to monitor leverage and to evaluate changes to the Company's capital structure. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and cash equivalents, and therefore, may imply that management intends to use cash and cash equivalents to reduce outstanding debt and that cash held in certain jurisdictions can be applied to repay obligations owing in other jurisdictions and without reduction for applicable taxes. In addition, net debt suggests that our debt obligations are less than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. (in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 Notes payable to banks (1) $ 492.3  $ 384.2  $ 378.6  Current portion of long-term debt 97.3  107.7  107.9  Long-term debt (2) 496.6  541.1  580.5  Total debt liabilities* $ 1,086.2  $ 1,033.0  $ 1,066.9  Less: Cash and cash equivalents 216.4  146.1  198.8  Net debt* $ 869.8  $ 886.9  $ 868.2  * Amounts may not equal column totals due to rounding (1)
The increase from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 is due to higher borrowings under the Company's foreign seasonal lines of credit used to finance higher green tobacco prices and processing costs in Africa and South America as well as increased borrowing capacity in certain markets. The increase from March 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 is due to seasonality of the business, with higher working capital requirements in the first half of the fiscal year. (2)
The decrease in long-term debt from December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 is due to the full repayment of outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility in December 2022. Weighted average borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $71.6 million. Working Capital The following summarizes our working capital: (in millions except for current ratio) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 218.4  $ 149.9  $ 200.9  Trade and other receivables, net 222.3  206.7  260.2  Inventories and advances to tobacco suppliers 776.3  802.0  798.4  Recoverable income taxes 7.1  5.3  7.9  Prepaid expenses and other current assets 47.1  47.3  60.3  Total current assets* $ 1,271.2  $ 1,211.2  $ 1,327.6  Notes payable to banks $ 492.3  $ 384.2  $ 378.6  Accounts payable 135.1  90.0  179.0  Advances from customers 30.8  63.2  53.0  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 95.3  79.6  82.2  Current portion of long-term debt 97.3  107.7  107.9  Other current liabilities 15.8  14.5  13.7  Total current liabilities $ 866.6  $ 739.2  $ 814.4  Current ratio
1.5 to 1 1.6 to 1 1.6 to 1 Working capital $ 404.6  $ 472.0  $ 513.2  * Amounts may not equal column totals due to rounding Working capital decreased from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 by $67.4 million, or 14.3%, primarily due to increased foreign seasonal lines of credit used to finance higher green tobacco prices and processing costs in Africa and South America and increased borrowing capacity in certain markets as well as the utilization of cash from higher sales of tobacco inventories to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility in December 2022, which was classified as long-term debt. 34 Inventories The following summarizes inventory committed to a customer and uncommitted inventory balances for processed tobacco: (in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 Committed $ 543.2  $ 590.4  $ 471.9  Uncommitted 28.7  60.0  45.7  Total processed tobacco $ 571.9  $ 650.4  $ 517.6  Total processed tobacco decreased from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 by $78.5 million, or 12.1%, primarily due to higher sales of inventories. See " Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " and " Note 7. Inventories " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. Sources and Uses of Cash We typically finance our non-U.S. tobacco operations with short-term foreign seasonal lines of credit. These foreign lines of credit are generally seasonal in nature, normally extending for a term of 180 to 365 days, corresponding to the tobacco crop cycle in that market. These short-term foreign seasonal lines of credit are typically uncommitted and provide lenders the right to cease making loans and demand repayment of loans. These short-term foreign seasonal lines of credit are generally renewed at the outset of each tobacco season. We maintain various other financing arrangements to meet the cash requirements of our businesses. See " Note 12.

We utilize capital in excess of cash flow from operations to finance accounts receivable, inventory, and advances to tobacco suppliers in foreign countries. In addition, we may periodically elect to purchase, redeem, repay, retire, or cancel indebtedness prior to stated maturity under our various foreign credit lines. As of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $218.4 million of which approximately $95.8 million was held in foreign jurisdictions, certain of which are subject to exchange controls and tax consequences that could limit our ability to fully repatriate these funds. Fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus many of the currencies in which we have costs may have an impact on our working capital requirements. We will continue to monitor and hedge foreign currency costs, as needed. 35 The following summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flows: Nine Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Trade and other receivables $ (91.2) $ (171.7) Inventories and advances to tobacco suppliers 18.5  (34.1) Payables and accrued expenses (29.8) (28.1) Advances from customers (22.2) 51.4  Other 14.1  (2.3) Net cash used by operating activities $ (110.6) $ (184.8) Collections from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables
122.6  155.2  Other (5.2) (7.4) Net cash provided by investing activities $ 117.4  $ 147.8  Net proceeds from short-term borrowings 116.5  11.9  Proceeds from DDTL facility —  117.6  Net repayment of revolving loan facilities (90.0) (15.0) Other (20.0) (22.3) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 6.5  $ 92.2  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3.8  (2.6) Increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash* $ 17.1  $ 52.5  * Amounts may not equal column totals due to rounding The change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased by $35.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the full repayment of the outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility during the period ended December 31, 2022 and the issuance of the DDTL Facility during the period ended December 31, 2021. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales and higher utilization of securitization facilities, which resulted in less cash used by operating activities. Planned Capital Expenditures Capital investments in our leaf operations have been made primarily for routine replacement of machinery and equipment, as well as investments in assets that will add value for our customers and increase our efficiency. We have incurred approximately $9.9 million in capital expenditures for the
nine months ended December 31, 2022 , and are expecting to incur an additional $11.1 million for the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.

Includes $5.3 million paid in the three months ended September 30, 2022 to fully fund the U.S. Pension Plan's liabilities in preparation to purchase a group annuity contract to administer future payments to the remaining U.S. Pension Plan participants. No cash dividends were paid to shareholders during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the payment of dividends is restricted under the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Exit Term Loan Credit Agreement, and the Existing Notes Indenture. 36 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As of the date of this report, there are no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in Part I, Item 7 "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance (not absolute) that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings
See " Note 18. Contingencies and Other Information "
to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information with respect to legal proceedings, which are incorporated by reference herein. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors should carefully consider our risk factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Except as set forth below, as of the date of this report,
there are no material changes or updates to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in the Compa ny's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 .
The impact of potential regulations to prohibit the sale of cigarettes in the United States other than low-nicotine cigarettes, if they are adopted and become effective, is uncertain, but they could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In June 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") announced its plan to publish a proposed rule in 2023 that would prohibit the sale of cigarettes in the United States other than cigarettes having significantly reduced levels of nicotine. The definitive provisions of such a proposed rule have not yet been announced and any rule proposal is subject to public comment prior to being adopted by the FDA.
Accordingly, the terms of any such final rule are uncertain and the date of effectiveness of such a rule is also uncertain.
While the FDA announced that reducing the nicotine levels of cigarettes would
37 reduce consumption of cigarettes by future generations and facilitate current smokers to stop consuming cigarettes, it is uncertain whether such potential regulations, if they are adopted and become effective, will have such effect.
While the impact of such potential regulations on the Company is also uncertain, such regulations, if they are adopted and become effective, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
