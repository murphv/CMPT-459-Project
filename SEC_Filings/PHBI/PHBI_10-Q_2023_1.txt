Nature of Business and Continuance of Operations       Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on November 26, 2007, under the name Azure International, Inc. On October 30, 2008, and effective as of the same date, the Company filed Articles of Merger (“Articles”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, to effect a merger by and between Air Transport Group Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation and Azure International, Inc. As a result of the merger, the Company changed its name to Air Transport Group Holdings, Inc. The Company was previously in the business of providing technical advisory and appraisals to the aircraft and aviation business as well as providing sourcing for aircraft leases and parts. Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement with WFS Pharmagreen Inc. (“WFS”) on May 2, 2018, the Company changed its name to Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. and changed its principal business to the production of starter plantlets for the North American high CBD hemp and medical cannabis industries through the application of the proprietary plant tissue culture in vitro process called “Chibafreen”. This proprietary process will produce plantlets that will be genetically identical and free of pests and disease free with consistent and certifiable constituent properties.   Going Concern   These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has not earned any revenues from operations, has a working capital deficit of $ 1,707,174 , and has an accumulated deficit of $ 12,614,269 . During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 39,374
and used cash flows for operations of $ 19,499 . Furthermore, the Company has defaulted on other convertible notes. These factors raise substantial doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.   The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies, disruptions of financial markets, and created uncertainty regarding potential impacts to the Company’s supply chain, operations, and customer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact the Company’s operations and the operations of the Company’s suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. Specifically, the Company attributes the pandemic to a delay in a planned financing which was to be used for the construction of the biotech complex, resulting in an impairment of the capitalized construction-in-progress at September 30, 2020. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further impacts the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s customers, suppliers, and vendors and the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The management team is closely following the progression of COVID-19 and its impact on the Company. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the Company may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Therefore, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time our business, liquidity, capital resources, and financial results.

Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Interim Financial Statements       These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for any future period.

Significant Accounting Policies
(continued)
(b) Basis of Presentation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in U.S. dollars. These condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, WFS Pharmagreen Inc. (“WFS”), and its 89.7% owned subsidiary 1155097 BC Ltd. (“115BC”), companies incorporated in British Columbia, Canada. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company’s fiscal year-end is September 30.
(c) Use of Estimates and Judgments     The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the equity component of convertible notes, fair value of derivative liabilities, fair value of stock-based payments, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.   The Company applies judgment in the application of the going concern assumption which requires management to take into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to 12 months from the end of the reporting period.
(d) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements       The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its condensed consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.       3.
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities consists of the following:
December 31, 2022 $     September 30, 2022 $                 Accounts payable     684,679       644,970   Accrued interest payable     98,533       79,906                           783,212       724,876     4.
Loans Payable
(a) On November 22, 2019, the Company entered into a promissory note with an unrelated party for $ 40,000
in connection with an equity purchase agreement. The promissory note is unsecured, was due on November 30, 2020, and bears interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of
10 % per annum. At December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded accrued interest payable of $ 12,415
(September 30, 2022 - $ 11,408 ) and the promissory note is in default. Refer to Note 12(b).

Loans Payable
(continued)
(b) On April 22, 2020, the Company received a loan for Cdn$ 40,000
from the Government of Canada under the Canada Emergency Business Account program (“CEBA”). As at December 31, 2022, the balance owing is $ 29,516
(Cdn$ 40,000 ) (September 30, 2022 - $ 29,252
(Cdn$ 40,000 )). These funds are interest free until December 31, 2023, at which time the remaining balance will convert to a 2-year term loan at an interest rate of 5% per annum.
If the Company repays the loan prior to December 31, 2023, there will be loan forgiveness of 25% of the principal balance repaid, up to a maximum of Cdn$10,000 .
(c) On January 14, 2020, the Company entered into a convertible note with an unrelated party for $ 78,000 , of which $ 3,000
was paid for financing costs, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $ 75,000 . The note was due on
January 14, 2021 , and bears interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of
12 % per annum, which increases to
15 % per annum upon default of the note. On August 2, 2022, the lender was ordered to surrender all common stock of the Company for cancellation, and surrender conversion rights for all remaining convertible notes pursuant to a judgement filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission with the United States District Court, Southern District of New York against the lender. As a result, the Company received and cancelled
660,300
shares of common stock and the conversion rights embedded in the convertible note was relinquished. As a result, the convertible note of $ 59,077
was reclassified from a convertible note payable to loans payable and its derivative liability of $ 163,760
was derecognized. In addition, the derecognition of the default penalty of $ 53,007
that was previously recognized and the fair value of the
660,300
shares of common stock of $ 4,606
were recognized as a recovery of default penalties during the year ended September 30, 2022.
As at December 31, 2022, the principal balance owing is $ 59,077
(September 30, 2022 - $ 59,077 ) and the Company has recorded interest payable of $ 25,447
(September 30, 2022 - $ 23,664 ).   5. Convertible Notes
(a)   On April 4, 2018, the amount of $ 32,485
owed to related parties was converted to Series A convertible notes, which are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on
April 4, 2023 . These notes are convertible in whole or in part, at any time until maturity, to common shares of the Company at $ 0.0001
per share. The outstanding balance remaining at maturity shall bear interest at
12 % per annum until fully paid. The Company evaluated the convertible notes for a beneficial conversion feature in accordance with ASC 470-20
Debt with Conversion and Other Options . The Company determined that the conversion price was below the closing stock price on the commitment date, and the convertible notes contained a beneficial conversion feature. The Company recognized the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of $ 32,485
as additional paid-in capital and reduced the carrying value of the convertible note to $nil. The carrying value will be accreted over the term of the convertible notes up to their face value of $ 32,485 .       As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the convertible notes was $ 21,885
(September 30, 2022 - $ 17,799 ) and had an unamortized discount of $ 5,183
(September 30, 2022 - $ 9,269 ). During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded accretion expense of $ 4,086
(2021 - $ 1,799 ).     10 Table of Contents   PHARMAGREEN BIOTECH INC.

(continued)
(b) On January 22, 2020, the Company entered into a convertible note with an unrelated party for $ 78,750 , of which $ 9,750

January 22, 2021 , and bears interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of
10 % per annum, payable in common stock, which increases to
24 % per annum upon default of the note.
The note may be converted at any time after the date of issuance into shares of Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 65% of the lowest trading price during the 20-trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date . In connection with the issuance of the above convertible note, the Company evaluated the conversion option for derivative treatment under ASC 815-15,
Derivatives and Hedging , and determined the note and conversion feature qualified as derivatives. The Company classified the conversion feature as a derivative liability at fair value. The initial fair value of the conversion feature was determined to be $ 75,179 . The Company recognized the maximum intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of $ 68,500 , resulting in a loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $ 6,679 , and reduced the carrying value of the convertible note to $ 500 . The carrying value will be accreted over the term of the convertible note up to its face value of $ 78,750 .       The financing costs were netted against the convertible note and are being amortized over the term using the effective interest rate method. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company defaulted on the convertible note and recognized accretion expense of $ 78,250 . On January 22, 2021, the Company failed to repay the note upon maturity.
As at December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the convertible note was $ 78,750
(September 30, 2022 - $ 78,750 ) and the fair value of the derivative liability was $ 104,676
(September 30, 2022 - $ 260,908 ).       (c) On March 11, 2022, the Company entered into a convertible note with an unrelated party for $ 30,000 , with an advance on January 18, 2022, for the full amount. The note is due on January 18, 2023, and bears interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of
10 % per annum. The note may be converted at any time after the date of issuance into shares of Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to the closing price on the day of receiving the notice to convert. In connection with the issuance of the above convertible note, the Company evaluated the conversion option for derivative treatment under ASC 815-15,
Derivatives and Hedging , and determined the note and conversion feature qualified as derivatives. The Company classified the conversion feature as a derivative liability at fair value. The initial fair value of the conversion feature was determined to be $ 15,011 , which reduced the carrying value of the convertible note to $ 14,989 . The carrying value will be accreted over the term of the convertible note up to its face value of $ 30,000 .       As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the convertible notes was $ 28,742
(September 30, 2022 - $ 23,489 ), had an unamortized discount of $ 1,258
(September 30, 2022 - $ 6,511 ), and the fair value of the derivative liability was $ 5,767
(September 30, 2022 - $ 10,486 ). During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded accretion expense of $ 5,253
(2021 - $nil).       (d) On November 2, 2022, the Company entered into a secured convertible note with an unrelated party for proceeds of $ 50,000 . The note is due on
May 1, 2023
and bears a one-time interest charge of
10 % automatically accrued on the issuance date. The one-time interest charge was netted against the convertible note and is being amortized over the term using the effective interest rate method. Stringent pre-payment terms of
25 % apply and any amount of principal or interest on the note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at
22 % per annum or the highest rate permitted by law.
The note may be converted at any time after 120 days following the date of issuance into shares of Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal 57.5% of the average of the 3 lowest trading prices during the 15-trading day period prior to the conversion date . Due to this provision, the Company considered whether the embedded conversion option qualifies for derivative accounting under ASC 815-15
Derivatives and Hedging . As the note isn’t convertible until 120 days following issuance, no derivative liability was recognized as of December 31, 2022.       As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the convertible notes was $ 46,582
(September 30, 2022 - $nil) and had an unamortized discount of $ 3,418
(September 30, 2022 - $nil). During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded accretion expense of $ 1,582
(2021 - $nil).

Derivative Liabilities     The embedded conversion option of the Company’s convertible notes described in Note 5 contain a conversion feature that qualifies for embedded derivative classification. The fair value of this liability will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial liabilities:
Balance, September 30, 2022     271,394   Change in fair value of embedded conversion option     ( 160,951 )           Balance, December 31, 2022     110,443
The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the embedded conversion option liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the binomial model based on various assumptions. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement. As required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table shows the assumptions used in the calculations:
Expected volatility     Risk-free interest rate     Expected dividend yield     Expected life (in years)                             As at September 30, 2022     161 %     3.33 %     0 %     0.26   As at December 31, 2022     217 %     4.38 %     0 %     0.22     7.

As a result of the merger, the Company changed its name to Air Transport Group Holdings, Inc.   On April 12, 2018, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with WFS Pharmagreen Inc., a private company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, whereby the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of WFS Pharmagreen Inc. in exchange for 37,704,500 shares of common stock of the Company. Upon completion of this transaction, the shareholders of WFS Pharmagreen hold 95.5% of voting control of the Company.   Immediately prior to closing of the Agreement, the majority shareholder of the Company was also the majority shareholder of WFS. As a result of the common ownership upon closing of the transaction, the acquisition was considered a common-control transaction and was outside the scope of the business combination guidance in ASC 805-50. The entities are deemed to be under common control as of February 27, 2018, which was the date that the majority shareholder acquired control of the Company and, therefore, held control over both companies. On May 2, 2018, the Share Exchange Agreement was effected. In connection with this transaction, the Company changed its name on May 8, 2018 to Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. and changed its year end from April 30th to September 30th.   Our principal executive offices are temporarily located at 2987 Blackbear Court, Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. Our telephone number is (702-803-9404). Our internet address is www.pharmagreen.ca.   On August 7, 2020, our company (including subsidiaries) filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada, Case No. 20-13886.   On October 9, 2020, a stay order was lifted by a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on an action filed by a lender. This effectively removed the Company from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and protection.   We expect to continue to incur losses for at least the next 12 months. We do not expect to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses, and we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to execute our plan of operations for at least the next twelve months. We will need to obtain additional financing, through equity security sales, debt instruments and private financing, to conduct our day-to-day operations, and to fully execute our business plan. We plan to raise the capital necessary to fund our business through the sale of equity securities, debt instruments or private financing. These factors raise substantial doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This report does not reflect all the adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
17 Table of Contents   Our Current Business   Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 26, 2007. The Company is headquartered in Coquitlam, British Columbia. The Company’s mission is to advance the technology of tissue culture science and to provide the highest quality 100% germ free, disease free and all genetically the same plantlets of high CBD hemp and other flora and offering full spectrum DNA testing for plant identification, live genetics preservation using low temperature storage for various cannabis and horticulture plants; extraction of botanical oils mainly CBD oil, and to deliver laboratory based services to the North American high CBD hemp, Cannabis and agriculture sectors.   Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. However, if the Company is unable to raise additional capital in the near future, due to the Company’s liquidity problems, management expects that the Company will need to curtail operations, liquidate assets, seek additional capital on less favourable terms and/or pursue other remedial measures. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   In 2021, the Company had changed its business development from Canada to the United States, as it was determined that the opportunities in the hemp and cannabis industries were much greater in the United States, specifically California.   On July 25, 2021, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to acquire all the assets and cannabis business operations (includes 12 acres property, structure and cannabis licenses, existing sales channels and distribution networks) from a private company situated in Northern California. Upon reaching a definitive agreement, the Company intended to further develop a state-of-the-art flowering greenhouse of approximately 12,000 square feet or the maximum allowed by California State and Regional County. The acquisition price of $2.4 million was to be paid through a combination of cash and shares. The Company also had an option from the seller to acquire an additional 120 acres or more of land for business expansion and development. The Company currently lacks funds with which to consummate the contemplated transaction and has not negotiated a definitive agreement with respect to the contemplated transaction.   In 2022, the Cannabis market in California entered a regression stage with prices for the raw materials dropping below production costs including greatly diminished demand for the sun grown raw material. Because of the current state of the Cannabis market in California, the Company terminated the MOU subsequent to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company will revisit the developemnt of the biotech complex infrastructure that will be capable of producing tissue cultured high CBD hemp starter plantlets, once the economy turns around.   Focusing on immediate revenues, the Company has been and is currently formulating its nutraceutical products from blends of therapeutic plants and fungi. Utilizing the Company’s expertise in plant genetics, Pharmagreen’s transgenic program uses the newest technology available to research and create nutraceuticals, for daily supplements with the potential to help, support and improve human lives, and to address a wide variety of ailments.   Pharmagreen's first new product, MaxGenomic(TM) Supplement, is a proprietary blend, formulated in the U. S. A., of nine medicinal mushrooms and six medicinal plants to help support the human mind and body. This supplement is produced in a U.S.A cGMP facility, in enteric capsules to enhance the bioavailability of the MaxGenomic(TM) supplement.   The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies, disruptions of financial markets, and created uncertainty regarding potential impacts to the Company’s supply chain, operations, and customer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact the Company’s operations and the operations of the Company’s suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. Specifically, the Company attributes the pandemic to a delay in a planned financing which was to be used for the construction of the biotech complex, resulting in an impairment of the capitalized construction-in-progress at September 30, 2020. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further impacts the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s customers, suppliers, and vendors and the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The management team is closely following the progression of COVID-19 and its impact on the Company. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the Company may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Therefore, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time our business, liquidity, capital resources, and financial results.
18 Table of Contents   Capital Resources and Liquidity   Our auditors have issued a “going concern” opinion on its audited financial statements for the latest year ended September 30, 2022, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues from our planned business model are anticipated until we have completed financing the Company. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has a working capital deficit of $1,707,174 and an accumulated deficit of $12,614,269. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.   We need to seek capital from resources such as the sale of private placements in the Company’s common stock or debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a, early-stage company with no or limited operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with such financing and in the case of high risk loans be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via such financing, it may be required to cease business operations.   As of December 31, 2022, we had $24,964 in cash, amounts receivable of $465, and prepaid expenses and deposits of $186,239, as compared to $8,016 in cash, amounts receivable of $383 and prepaid expenses and deposits of $200,572 as of September 30, 2022. As of the date of this Form 10-Q, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the expenses related to maintaining our planned operations. We are in the process of seeking additional equity financing in the form of private placements, loans and registration statements to fund our intended business operations.   Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful or we are successful in raising funds from registered securities, we will generate sales revenue within twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.   We do not anticipate researching any further products nor the purchase or sale of any significant equipment. We also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees.   Results of Operations   Three Months Ended December 31, 2022   We had no revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Operating expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $181,093 which was consistent with operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $203,660.   We had a comprehensive loss of $39,374 during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a comprehensive income of $18,724 during the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in comprehensive loss in 2022 was mainly attributable to a change in fair value of derivative liabilities from a gain of $234,274 in 2021 to a gain of $160,951 in 2022, which resulted from fluctuations of the derivative liability due to the floating rates attached to the conversion rights to the convertible debt.   During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized net loss of $39,374 and a net income of $18,724, respectively.
19 Table of Contents   Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the company’s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term “off-balance sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party, under which the company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   In connection with this quarterly report, as required by Rule 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company’s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company’s management, including our company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.   The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company’s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Due to these material weaknesses management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2022.   Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company's previous reported financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company's determination to its financial statements for the future periods.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   Sadler Gibb & Associates LLC, our independent auditors, are not required to and have not performed an assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting.
20 Table of Contents   PART II—OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   On July 22, 2020, the Company received a preliminary statement of claim from a convertible note holder for failure of the Company to deliver shares of common stock upon receipt of notices of conversion. Pursuant to the claim, the plaintiff has requested receipt of all shares of common stock requested in the notices of conversion, and also damages in an amount to be determined at trial but in any event in excess of principal amount of $78,000 for a total sum of $180,000, including without limitation the balance of any portion of the convertible note that ultimately is not converted into shares of common stock, along with default interest, liquidated damages, and damages as provided for in the convertible note.   On October 9, 2020, a stay order was lifted by a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on an action filed by a lender. This effectively removed the Company from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and protection. The lifting of the stay order further allowed the convertible note holders to convert thereby increasing the number of shares issued and outstanding.   On October 29, 2020 a second note holder filed a statement of claim. This lender, as of December 24, 2020, has completely converted the full amount of the note of $100,000, interest of $8,690 and penalty and fees aggregating $19,500.   Also, as mentioned above, the Company filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada on August 7, 2020. The Company’s filing with the Court was designated as Case No. 20-13886. During the pendency of this matter, the Company has also filed motions with the Court seeking authorization to continue to operate its businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court. Due to the stay order mentioned, the Company did not file a plan of reorganization with the Court for approval.   On March 12, 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the convertible noteholder that had filed a preliminary statement of claim on July 22, 2020. Pursuant to the agreement the Company was required to honor various conversion notices and the note holder agreed to wave all principal, interest and penalties incurred.   On March 10, 2021, the promissory note holder referred to in Note 4 (a) of the accompanying consolidated financial statements filed a Notice of Motion For Summary Judgement in Lieu of Complaint (the “Notice”) with the State of New York Supreme Court, County of New York for $40,504 plus interest at the rate of 10% per annum from January 6, 2021 plus costs. On July 31, 2021, the Notice was dismissed without prejudice by the State of New York Supreme Court. On October 20, 2021, the promissory note holder filed an Amended Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment in Lieu of Complaint with the State of New York Supreme Court, County of New York for $44,504 plus interest at the rate of 10% per annum from January 6, 2021, plus costs and attorney fees. The plaintiff filed for an oral argument which was heard by the State of New York Supreme Court on September 15, 2022 and is pending a final decision. The Company believes the claim is without merit, as evidenced by the initial claim being dismissed by the same courts, and will vigorously defend its position.   Except as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, there are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or stockholder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company.
