Table of Contents Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations VWF Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), a Maryland corporation and registered savings and loan holding company, was incorporated on February 25, 2022, to serve as the savings and loan holding company for Van Wert Federal Savings Bank (“Van Wert Federal” or the “Bank”) in connection with the Bank’s conversion from the mutual form of organization to the stock form of organization (the “Conversion”).
The Conversion was completed on July 13, 2022. The Company’s shares began trading on OTCQB under the symbol VWFB on July 14, 2022. In connection with the Conversion, the Company acquired
100 % ownership of the Bank and the Company offered and sold
1,922,924
shares of its common stock at $ 10.00
per share, for gross offering proceeds of $ 19,229,000 . The cost of the conversion and issuance of common stock was approximately $ 1,364,000 , which was deducted from the gross offering proceeds. The Bank’s employee stock ownership plan purchased
153,834
shares of the common stock sold by the Company, which was
8 % of the
1,922,924
shares of common stock issued by the Company. The ESOP purchased the shares using a loan from the Company. The Company contributed $ 8,932,000
of the net proceeds from the offering to the Bank, loaned $ 1,538,000
of the net proceeds to the ESOP and retained approximately $ 7,394,000
of the net proceeds.
Following the Conversion, voting rights in the Company are held and exercised exclusively by the shareholders of the Company. Deposit account holders continue to be insured by the FDIC. The Bank may not pay a dividend on its capital stock if the effect thereof would cause retained earnings to be reduced below regulatory capital requirements. In addition, the Company is subject to certain regulations related to the payment of dividends and the repurchase of its capital stock. The Conversion was accounted for as a change in corporate form with the historic basis of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and equity unchanged as a result. The Bank is a federally chartered mutual thrift engaged primarily in the business of originating residential mortgage loans and accepting deposits. Its operations are conducted through its office located in Van Wert, Ohio. The Bank faces competition from other financial institutions and is subject to the regulation of certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. Interim Financial Statements The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are unaudited and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Such adjustments are the only adjustments contained in these unaudited consolidated financial statements. These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) have been omitted. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the remainder of the year ending June 30, 2023, or any other period. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements as of and for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 contained in the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2022. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Van Wert Federal.
All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 8
Table of Contents Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, valuation of deferred tax assets and fair values of financial instruments. Loans Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balances adjusted for unearned income, charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses and any unamortized deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. For loans amortized at cost, interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, as well as premiums and discounts, are deferred and amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the loan. For all loan portfolio segments except residential and consumer loans, the Bank promptly charges-off loans, or portions thereof, when available information confirms that specific loans are uncollectible based on information that includes, but is not limited to, (1) the deteriorating financial condition of the borrower, (2) declining collateral values, and/or (3) legal action, including bankruptcy, that impairs the borrower’s ability to adequately meet its obligations. For impaired loans that are considered to be solely collateral dependent, a partial charge-off is recorded when a loss has been confirmed by an updated appraisal or other appropriate valuation of the collateral. The Bank charges-off residential and consumer loans, or portions thereof, when the Bank reasonably determines the amount of the loss. The Bank adheres to delinquency thresholds established by applicable regulatory guidance to determine the charge-off timeframe for these loans. Loans at these delinquency thresholds for which the Bank can clearly document that the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection, such that collection will occur regardless of delinquency status, need not be charged off. For all classes, all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. The Bank requires a period of satisfactory performance of not less than six months before returning a nonaccrual loan to accrual status. When cash payments are received on impaired loans in each loan class, the Bank records the payment as interest income unless collection of the remaining recorded principal amount is doubtful, at which time payments are used to reduce the principal balance of the loan. Troubled debt restructured loans recognize interest income on an accrual basis at the renegotiated rate if the loan is in compliance with the modified terms, no principal reduction has been granted and the loan has demonstrated the ability to perform in accordance with the renegotiated terms for a period of at least six months. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to income. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance consists of allocated and general components. The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral
9
Table of Contents value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers nonimpaired loans and is based on historical charge-off experience by segment. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Bank over the prior three years. Management believes the three-year historical loss experience methodology is appropriate in the current economic environment. Other adjustments (qualitative/environmental considerations) for each segment may be added to the allowance for each loan segment after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due, based on the loan’s current payment status and the borrower’s financial condition, including available sources of cash flows. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for non-homogenous type loans such as commercial, non-owner-occupied residential, multi-family, nonresidential and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For impaired loans where the Bank utilizes the discounted cash flows to determine the level of impairment, the Bank includes the entire change in the present value of cash flows as bad debt expense. The fair values of collateral dependent impaired loans are based on independent appraisals of the collateral. In general, the Bank acquires an updated appraisal upon identification of impairment and annually thereafter for commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family loans. If the most recent appraisal is over a year old, and a new appraisal is not performed, due to lack of comparable values or other reasons, the existing appraisal is utilized and discounted based on the age of the appraisal, condition of the subject property and overall economic conditions. After determining the collateral value as described, the fair value is calculated based on the determined collateral value less selling expenses. The potential for outdated appraisal values is considered in our determination of the allowance for loan losses through our analysis of various trends and conditions including the local economy, trends in charge-offs and delinquencies, etc. and the related qualitative adjustments assigned by the Bank. Segments of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated for impairment based on the segment’s historical loss experience adjusted for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant factors that affect repayment of the loans. Accordingly, the Bank does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower. In the course of working with borrowers, the Bank may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. In this scenario, the Bank attempts to work out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to optimize collectability of the loan. Any loans that are modified are reviewed by the Bank to identify if a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) has occurred, which is when, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, the Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with the borrower’s current financial status, and the restructuring of the loan may include the transfer of assets from the borrower to satisfy the debt, a modification of loan terms or a combination of the two. If such efforts by the Bank do not result in a satisfactory arrangement, the loan is referred to legal counsel, at which time foreclosure proceedings are initiated. At any time prior to a sale of the property at foreclosure, the Bank may terminate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower is able to work out a satisfactory payment plan. It is the Bank’s policy that any restructured loans on nonaccrual status prior to being restructured remain on nonaccrual status until six months of satisfactory borrower performance, at which time management would consider its return to accrual status. If a loan was accruing at the time of restructuring, the Bank reviews the loan to determine if it is appropriate to continue the accrual of interest on the restructured loan. With regard to determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses, troubled debt restructured loans are considered to be impaired. As a result, the determination of the amount of impaired loans for each portfolio segment within troubled debt restructurings is the same as detailed previously. 10
Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The Company accounts for revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606) and all subsequent ASUs that modified ASC 606. ASC 606 provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Interest income, net securities gains (losses) and income from bank-owned life insurance are not included within the scope of ASC 606. For the revenue streams in the scope of ASC 606, service charges on deposits and electronic banking fees, there are no significant judgments related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition. All the Company’s in scope revenue from contracts with customers is recognized within other noninterest income. Deposit Services.
The Company generates revenues through fees charged to depositors related to deposit account maintenance fees, overdrafts, ATM fees, wire transfers and additional miscellaneous services provided at the request of the depositor. For deposit-related services, revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied, which is, generally, at a point in time. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed in a manner similar to that of basic EPS except that the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include the number of incremental common shares that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were issued during the period. The Company had
no
potentially dilutive stock equivalents at December 31, 2022. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS calculations until they are committed to be released. The computation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended

Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The ASU introduced a new credit loss model, the current expected credit loss model (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The CECL model utilizes a lifetime “expected credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-to-maturity securities and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. For available-for-sale securities where fair value is less than cost, credit-related impairment, if any, will be recognized in an allowance for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes in expected credit risk. This model replaces the multiple existing impairment models, which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized. The CECL model represents a significant change from existing practice and may result in
11
Table of Contents material changes to the Company’s accounting for financial instruments. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2016-13 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. The impact of the ASU will depend upon the state of the economy and the nature of our portfolios at the date of adoption. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Note 3: Debt Securities Debt securities held by the Company generally are classified and recorded in the financial statements as available for sale, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss).

Table of Contents The carrying value of securities pledged as collateral, to secure public deposits and for other purposes, was $ 7,380,000
and $ 4,652,000
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had  no  sales of available for sale securities . Proceeds from sales of securities totaled $ 9,708,000
during the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2021. Such sales resulted in realized losses of $ 291,000 . Certain investments in debt securities are reported in the financial statements at an amount less than their historical cost. Total fair value of these investments at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was $ 39,354,000
and $ 22,517,000 , which is approximately
99.8  percent and
91.9  percent, respectively, of the fair value of the Company’s total investment portfolio. These declines primarily resulted from changes in market interest rates. Based on evaluation of available evidence, including recent changes in market interest rates and information obtained from regulatory filings, management believes the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary. Should the impairment of any of these securities become other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized in net income in the period the other-than-temporary impairment is identified. The following tables show the Company’s investments’ gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company’s investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment class and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ ​ Less than 12 Months      12 Months or More      Total ​ ​ Fair      Unrealized ​ Fair      Unrealized ​ Fair      Unrealized Description of Securities ​ Value ​ Losses ​ Value ​ Losses ​ Value ​ Losses U.S. Government agencies ​ $

Table of Contents U.S. Government Agencies, Subordinated Debt and State and Political Subdivisions Unrealized losses on these securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers’ bonds are of high credit quality, values have only been impacted by changes in interest rates since the securities were purchased, and the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach the maturity date. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in market interest rates, and not credit quality, and because the Company typically does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022. Mortgage-backed GSE’s and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations The unrealized losses on the Company’s investment in residential mortgage-backed securities were caused by changes in interest rates and illiquidity. The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the securities. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in market interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022 ​ Note 4: Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses Categories of loans at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 include: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31,       June 30,  ​ ​ ​ 2022 ​ 2022      ​   ​ (Unaudited)   ​    ​ Real estate loans: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Commercial ​ $

Table of Contents The Company has adopted a standard loan grading system for all loans. Loan grades are numbered 1 through 8. Grades 1 through 3 are considered satisfactory grades. The grade of 4, Monitor, represents loans requiring more than normal attention. The grade of 5, Special Mention, represents loans of lower quality and is considered criticized. The grades of 6, or Substandard, and 7, Doubtful, refer to loans that are classified. Pass (1-3)
Loans of reasonable credit strength and repayment ability providing a satisfactory credit risk. Monitor (4)
Loans requiring more than normal attention resulting from underwriting weaknesses as to repayment terms, loan structure, financial and/or documentation exceptions. Special Mention (5)
Loans which may include the characteristics of the Monitor classification, problems that need to be addresses by both the lender and the borrower. Substandard (6)
Loans which may include the characteristics of the Special Mention classification, but also reflects financial and other problems that might result in some loss at a future date and/or reliance upon collateral for ultimate collection. Doubtful (7)
Loans for which some loss is anticipated, but the timing and amount of the loss is not definite. Loss (8)
Loans considered non-bankable assets which may or may not have some salvage value. Risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are described as follows: Commercial Real Estate These loans include commercial real estate and residential real estate secured by property with five or more units. The main risks are changes in the value of the collateral, ability of borrowers to collect rents, vacancy and changes in the tenants’ employment status. Management specifically considers unemployment and changes in real estate values in the Company’s market area. Residential Real Estate These loans include first liens and junior liens on 1-4 family residential real estate (both owner and non-owner occupied). The main risks for these loans are changes in the value of the collateral and stability of the local economic environment and its impact on the borrowers’ employment. Management specifically considers unemployment and changes in real estate values in the Company’s market area. Multifamily These loans include loans on residential real estate secured by property with five or more units. The main risks are changes in the value of collateral, ability of borrowers to collect rents, vacancy and changes in the tenants’ employment status. Management specifically considers unemployment and changes in real estate values in the Company’s market area. Agriculture Real Estate These loans include loans on farm ground, vacant land for development and loans on commercial real estate. The main risks are changes in the value of the collateral and changes in the economy or borrowers’ business operations. Management specifically considers unemployment and changes in real estate values in the Company’s market area. 17
Table of Contents Construction and Land Real Estate These loans include construction loans for 1-4 family residential and commercial properties (both owner and non-owner occupied) and first liens on land. The main risks for construction loans include uncertainties in estimating costs of construction and in estimating the market value of the completed project. The main risks for land loans are changes in the value of the collateral and stability of the local economic environment. Management specifically considers unemployment and changes in real estate values in the Company's market area. HELOC These loans are generally secured by owner-occupied 1-4 family residences. The main risks for these loans are changes in the value of the collateral and stability of the local economic environment and its impact on the borrowers’ employment. Management specifically considers unemployment and changes in real estate values in the Company’s market area. Commercial and Industrial The commercial and industrial portfolio includes loans to commercial customers for use in financing working capital needs, equipment purchases and expansions. The loans in this category are repaid primarily from the cash flow of a borrower’s principal business operation. Credit risk in these loans is driven by creditworthiness of the borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations. Consumer Loans These loans include vehicle loans, share loans and unsecured loans. The main risks for these loans are the depreciation of the collateral values (vehicles) and the financial condition of the borrowers. Major employment changes are specifically considered by management. 18

225,582 ​ ​ There were
no
significant loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring during the six months ended December 31, 2022 or for the year ended June 30, 2022. There were
no
troubled debt restructurings modified in the past 12 months that subsequently defaulted for the six months ended December 31, 2022 or for the year ended June 30, 2022. Note 5: Regulatory Matters The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under U.S. GAAP reporting requirements and regulatory capital standards. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, the Bank’s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in these financial statements. On November 13, 2019, the federal regulators finalized and adopted a regulatory capital rule establishing a new community bank leverage ratio (CBLR), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The intent of the CBLR is to provide a simple alternative measure of capital adequacy for electing qualifying depository institutions and depository institution holding companies, as directed under the
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act . If a qualifying depository institution, or depository institution holding company, elects to use such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets ( i.e. , leverage ratio) exceeds 9 percent, subject to a limited
two
quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go
100
basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. In April 2020, under the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
(CARES Act), the 9 percent leverage ratio threshold was temporarily reduced to 8 percent in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The threshold increased to 8.5 percent in 2021 and returned to 9 percent in 2022. The Bank has elected to use the CBLR. The Bank’s CBLR was
22.56  percent and
17.54  percent as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Management believes, as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Note 6: Disclosures about Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Fair value is the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs that reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 22

There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and for the year ended June 30, 2022. Available-for-sale Securities Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. The Company had
no
Level 3 securities. The Company had
no
assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. ​ 23

— ​ Limitations:
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Fair value estimates may not be realizable in an immediate settlement of the instrument. In some instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s various financial instruments, in which case fair values may be based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques, or based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristic of the financial instruments, or other factors. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. Subsequent changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. ​ Note 7: Commitments Commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer’s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate. Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates. Since a portion of the line may expire without being drawn upon, the total unused lines do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer’s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty.

The Company will make annual contributions to the ESOP in amounts as defined by the plan document. These contributions are used to pay debt service. Certain ESOP shares are pledged as collateral for debt. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to active employees, based on the proportion of debt service paid in the year. ​ In connection with the Company's initial public stock offering, the ESOP borrowed $ 1.5
million from the Company for the purpose of purchasing shares of the Company's common stock. A total of
153,834
shares were purchased with the loan proceeds. Accordingly, common stock acquired by the ESOP is shown as a reduction of shareholders' equity. The loan is expected to be repaid over a period of up to
20 years . ​ The annual contribution to the ESOP was made during the six months ended December 31, 2022, as loan payments are made annually on December 31st of each year. Compensation expense is recognized over the service period based on the average fair value of the shares and totaled $ 106,000
for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
There was
no
ESOP compensation expense for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
​ At December 31, 2022, there were
no
shares allocated to participants. There were
7,692
shares committed to be released to participants and
146,142
unallocated shares. The fair value of unallocated ESOP shares totaled $ 2.0
million at December 31, 2022. ​ Note 9: Defined Benefit Plan ​ In the Company’s prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company disclosed the Bank’s intention to withdrawal from the defined benefit plan. On December 14, 2022, the Bank took action to withdrawal from the current multiemployer plan and transfer funds to a qualified successor plan in calendar year 2023. An estimate of the liability was made by a third-party firm in the amount of $ 930,000 , which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. The final termination and settlement of the withdrawal will not be determined until later in calendar year 2023. The difference in the amount recorded and the actual expense could be material. ​ ​ Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding VWF Bancorp, Inc.’s (“the Company”) consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2022 and consolidated results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. It should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 25
Table of Contents Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “plan,” “seek,” “expect,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “indicate,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “target” and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: ● statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; ● statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; ● statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and ● estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: ● conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the severity and duration of the associated economic slowdown either nationally or in our market area, which are worse than expected; ● inflation and general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market area, which are worse than expected; ● changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; ● our ability to access cost-effective funding; ● fluctuations in real estate values and in the conditions of the residential real estate, commercial real estate, and agricultural real estate markets; ● our ability to control cost and expenses, particularly those associated with operating a publicly traded company; ● demand for loans and deposits in our market area; ● our ability to implement and change our business strategies; ● competition among depository and other financial institutions; ● inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of our financial instruments, or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments within our loan portfolio; ● adverse changes in the securities markets; ● changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums; 26
Table of Contents ● changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; ● technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; ● the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; ● a failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks; ● our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk; ● our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; ● changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; ● changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; ● our ability to retain key employees; ● our ability to control costs when hiring employees in a highly competitive environment; ● changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. New President and Chief Executive Officer As previously reported, the Company announced that Michael D. Cahill, CPA became a consultant to the Bank effective October 1, 2022. He served as a consultant for the remainder of the calendar year and the Company and Bank appointed him to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2023. He was also appointed as a director of the Company and Bank effective January 1, 2023. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have opted to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. The following are our critical accounting policies: Allowance for Loan Losses.
The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for
27
Table of Contents losses on loans which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. The analysis has two components, specific and general allowances. The specific percentage allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan’s carrying value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results. Deferred Tax Assets.
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Determining the proper valuation allowance for deferred taxes is critical in properly valuing the deferred tax asset and the related recognition of income tax expense or benefit. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Fair Value Measurements .
The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Van Wert Federal estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 Total Assets.
Total assets were $146.9 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 1.8%, from June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily comprised of a decrease in cash and due from banks of $18.1 million, a decrease in interest-bearing time deposits of $735,000, which were partially offset by an increase in loans of $2.2 million and an increase in available-for-sale debt securities of $14.9 million. Cash and Due from Banks.
Cash and due from banks decreased by $18.1 million, or 49.4%, to $18.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $36.7 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was due primarily to funding purchases of investment securities and loan growth. 28
Table of Contents Interest Bearing Time Deposits.
Interest-bearing time deposits decreased by $735,000, or 50.0%, to $735,000 at December 31, 2022 from $1.5 million at June 30, 2022. Certificates of deposit maturing during the six months ended December 31, 2022 were not renewed as management invested the proceeds from these securities into higher yielding instruments. Investment Securities.
Investment securities increased $14.9 million, or 60.9%, to $39.4 million at December 31, 2022, from $24.5 million at June 30, 2022. Aggregate securities purchases of $17.4 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022, were partially offset by $1.7 million of calls, maturities and repayments as well as a $733,000 decline in fair value of the securities over the period. The yield on investment securities was 2.71% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.14% for the six months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the
increase in market interest rates during the period . The $700,000 decline in the fair value of the investment securities was primarily attributable to the increases in market interest rates. As market interest rates increased, the fair value of the securities declined. The unrealized losses are recorded to shareholders’ equity, net of tax, as management has determined that there are no credit quality concerns with the issuers of the securities and there is no intent to sell the securities and, as a result, the fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity dates. Net Loans.
Net loans increased by $2.2 million, or 2.8%, to $79.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $77.7 million at June 30, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, loan originations totaled $8.0 million, comprised of $5.8 million of loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate, $1.2 million secured by agricultural real estate, $234,000 of consumer loans and $783,000 of construction and land. Increases in loan balances reflect our strategy to grow our loan portfolio, continuing to focus primarily on owner-occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans, while increasing our emphasis on commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans. Management intends to continue to pursue growth in these loan segments in future periods. Deposits.
Deposits decreased by $3.9 million, or 3.5%, to $106.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $110.0 million at June 30, 2022. Core deposits (defined as all deposits other than certificates of deposit) decreased $1.7 million, or 2.3%, to $73.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $74.8 million at June 30, 2022. Certificates of deposit decreased $2.2 million, or 6.2%, to $33.0 million at December 31, 2022 from $35.2 million at June 30, 2022. The demand for new mortgage loans has decreased because of rising interest rates, reducing the need to increase deposits. Due to significant liquidity and capital, management allowed some deposit run off in the face of the rising rate environment. Management intends to concentrate its efforts of growth in consumer and business demand deposits. Shareholders’ Equity.
Shareholders’ equity increased $15.5 million, or 66.4%, to $38.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $23.4 million at June 30, 2022. The increase resulted from the $16.3 million net proceeds of the capital raised through the conversion, which was partially offset by a net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of $338,000 and a $579,000 increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss, primarily due to net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities caused by the increase in market interest rates during the period. Average Balances and Yields .
The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects are immaterial. Average balances are calculated using month-end average balances, rather than daily average balances. We believe the use of month-end average balances is representative of our operations. Non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Average yields include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. Deferred loan fees are immaterial. 29

The Company reported a net loss of $493,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, that exceeded the net loss reported for the three months ended December 31, 2021, by $321,000, or 187.0%, due primarily to a $835,000 increase in noninterest expense, which was partially offset by a $425,000 increase in net interest income and a $92,000 decrease in federal income tax expense. Interest Income.
Interest income increased $425,000, or 54.2%, to $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $785,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was attributable to a $238,000, or 304.4%, increase in interest on investment securities, a $145,000, or 580.1%, increase in interest on interest-bearing deposits and other, and a $43,000, or 6.2% increase in interest on loans. The average balance of loans during the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased by $4.9 million, or 6.3%, from the average balance for the three months ended December 31, 2021, while the average yield on loans stayed the same, at 3.46% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 30
Table of Contents The average balance of investment securities increased $16.9 million, or 64.2%, to $43.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from December 31, 2021, while the average yield on investment securities increased by 174 basis points to 2.92% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 1.18% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase in yields resulted from the effects of management’s sale of lower yielding investments in December 2021 and purchases of higher yielding securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The average balance of other interest-bearing deposits, comprised of certificates of deposit in other financial institutions, overnight deposits and stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, decreased $5.4 million, or 23.7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and the average yield increased 344 basis points to 3.88% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 0.44% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 reflecting the rise in the interest rate environment. Interest Expense.
Total interest expense increased $1,000, or 0.6%, to $85,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $84,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a increase in the average cost of deposits to 0.33% for the three  months ended December 31, 2022, from
0.32% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting how management has worked to manage the cost of deposits over the period as interest rates in the economy have been increasing in recent months, which was partially offset by an increase of $304,000, or 0.3%, in the average balance of deposits, to $104.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $104.3 million for three months ended December 31, 2021. Net Interest Income .
Net interest income increased $425,000, or 60.6%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $701,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase reflected an increase in the interest rate spread to 3.03% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 2.13% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The net interest margin increased to 3.12% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 2.19% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Provision for Loan Losses.
Based on an analysis of the factors described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Critical Accounting Estimates – Allowance for Loan Losses,” management concluded that a provision for loan losses was not required for each of the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The allowance for loan losses was $223,000 at both December 31, 2022 and 2021 and represented 0.28% of total loans at December 31, 2022, and 0.29% of total loans at December 31, 2021. The determination over the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses was due primarily to the low balances of nonperforming loans, delinquent loans and no net charge-offs in both periods. Total nonperforming loans were $267,000 at December 31, 2022, compared to $161,000 at December 31, 2021. Total loans past due greater than 30 days were $1.3 million and $1.5 million at those respective dates. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 83.5% at December 31, 2022, compared to 138.2% at December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate management believes to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions. Furthermore, as an integral part of its examination process, the OCC will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The OCC may have judgments different than those of management, and we may determine to increase our allowance as a result of these regulatory reviews. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Non-Interest Income .
Non-interest income decreased by $3,000, or 5.3%, to $52,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $55,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to normal fluctuations in the volume of fees on loans and deposits. Noninterest Expense.
Noninterest expense increased $835,000, or 85.9%, to $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase reflects $56,000, or 16.1%, increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $147,000, or 430.0%, increase in professional services and a decrease of $291,000, or 100%, of loss on the sale of securities compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2021. The increase in professional services was due primarily to costs related to increased costs of operating and the reporting requirements of a public stock company. There was also a one-time charge of $930,000 during the period associated with withdrawing from the multiemployer plan. 31
Table of Contents Federal Income Taxes.
Federal income taxes increased by $92,000, or 204.5%, to a $137,000 benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a $45,000 benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the federal income tax provision was due primarily to a $412,000, or 190.6%, decrease in pretax net income. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the Six Months Ended December 31,  ​ ​ 2022 ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​   ​   Average  ​ ​ ​   ​   Average  ​ ​ ​   ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding  ​ ​ ​ ​ Yield/  ​ Outstanding  ​ ​ ​ ​ Yield/  ​ ​      Balance      Interest      Rate      Balance      Interest      Rate ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest-earning assets:   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Loans   $

Net loss totaled $338,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $230,000, or 213.6%, compared to a net loss of $108,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $982,000 increase in noninterest expense, which was partially offset by a $682,000 increase in net interest income and a $73,000 decrease in federal income tax expense. Interest Income.
Interest income increased $659,000, or 41.9%, to $2.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was attributable to a $354,000, or 226.7%,
32
Table of Contents increase in interest on investment securities, a $256,000, or 477.0%, increase in interest on interest-bearing deposits and other, and a $49,000, or 3.6% increase in interest on loans. The average balance of loans during the six months ended December 31, 2022, increased by $4.6 million, or 5.9%, from the average balance for the six months ended December 31, 2021, while the average yield on loans decreased by 8 basis points to 3.40% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 3.48% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in average yield on reflects that the recent increases in market interest rates have only started to slowly impact the loan portfolio. The average balance of investment securities increased $10.4 million, or 38.1%, to $37.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $27.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, while the average yield on investment securities increased by 157 basis points to 2.71% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 1.14% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. This increase in yields resulted from the effects of management’s sale of lower yielding investments in December 2021 and purchases of higher yielding securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The average balance of other interest-bearing deposits, comprised of certificates of deposit in other financial institutions, overnight deposits and stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, increased $4.5 million, or 22.5%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and the average yield increased 199 basis points to 2.53% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 0.54% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 reflecting the rise in the interest rate environment. Interest Expense.
Total interest expense decreased $23,000, or 12.7%, to $156,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $179,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of deposits to 0.30% for the six  months ended December 31, 2022, from
0.35% for the six months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting how management has worked to manage the cost of deposits over the period as interest rates in the economy have been increasing in recent months, which was partially offset by an increase of $2.5 million, or 2.4%, in the average balance of deposits, to $104.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. Net Interest Income .
Net interest income increased $682,000, or 48.9%, to $2.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase reflected an increase in the interest rate spread to 2.77% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 2.15% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The net interest margin increased to 2.86% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 2.22% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Provision for Loan Losses.

Table of Contents Non-Interest Income .
Non-interest income decreased by $3,000, or 2.8%, to $106,000 for the six  months ended
December 31, 2022, compared to $109,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 due to normal fluctuations in the volume of fees on loans and deposits. Noninterest Expense.
Noninterest expense increased $982,000, or 59.8%, to $2.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase reflects an $85,000, or 12.1%, increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $263,000, or 360.9%, increase in professional services and a decrease of $291,000, or 100%, of loss on the sale of securities compared to the six month period ended December 31, 2021. The increase in professional services was due primarily to costs related to increased costs of operating and the reporting requirements of a public stock company. There was also a one-time charge of $930,000 during the period associated with withdrawing from the multiemployer plan.
Federal Income Taxes.
Federal income taxes increased by $73,000, or 194.1%, to a $110,000 benefit provision for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a $37,000 benefit provision for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the federal income tax provision was due primarily to a $303,000, or 208.6%, decrease in pretax net income. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. At December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. At December 31, 2022, we had the capacity to borrow $46.2 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. For further information, see the statements of cash flows contained in the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. VWF Bancorp, Inc. is a separate legal entity from Van Wert Federal and must provide for its own liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations. Its primary source of income is dividends received from Van Wert Federal. The amount of dividends that Van Wert Federal may declare and pay is governed by applicable bank regulations. At December 31, 2022, VWF Bancorp, Inc. (on a stand-alone, unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $7.5 million. ​ At December 31, 2022, Van Wert Federal’s Tier 1 leverage capital was $34.2 million, or 22.6% of adjusted assets. Accordingly, it was categorized as well-capitalized at December 31, 2022 under the “community bank leverage ratio” framework. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
At December 31, 2022, we had $5.3 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans, $3.1 million of which represents the balance of remaining funds to be disbursed on construction loans in process. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2022 totaled $13.7 million at December 31, 2022. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 34
