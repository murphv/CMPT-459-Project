Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - NONCASH OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS: Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Stadco entered into a payment arrangement agreement (the “Payment Agreement”) with the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles (the “LADWP”), to settle previously outstanding amounts for water, water service, electric energy and/or electric service in the aggregate amount of $ 1,770,201
that are delinquent and unpaid. This liability amount was included in accounts payable on the Company’s balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, and was reclassified as a current liability for $ 221,272
to accrued expenses and to noncurrent liabilities for $ 1,548,929
in December 2022. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021 On August 25, 2021, in exchange for the issuance of
1,466,061
shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase
100,000
shares of the common stock, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Stadco, acquired certain other securities of Stadco and satisfied certain liabilities of Stadco. The fair value of the common stock transferred was $ 2,269,000 , based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the closing date, August 25, 2021. The fair value of the warrants transferred was $ 46,256
and was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Also, in connection with the Stadco acquisition, the Company became party to an amended and restated lease agreement to rent buildings and property at the Stadco manufacturing location and recorded a right-of-use asset and liability of approximately $ 6.7
million. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS TechPrecision Corporation, or “TechPrecision”, is a Delaware corporation organized in February 2005 under the name Lounsberry Holdings II, Inc. On February 24, 2006, we acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiary Ranor, Inc., or “Ranor.” Ranor, together with its predecessors, has been in continuous operation since 1956. The name was changed to TechPrecision Corporation on March 6, 2006. TechPrecision is the parent company of Ranor, Westminster Credit Holdings, LLC, or “WCH”, Stadco New Acquisition, LLC, or “Acquisition Sub”, Stadco and Wuxi Critical Mechanical Components Co., Ltd., or “WCMC”, a wholly foreign owned enterprise. WCMC was dissolved and deregistered in November 2021 and has had no customers or operations for over five years. TechPrecision, Ranor, WCH, WCMC (until November 2021), Acquisition Sub and Stadco are collectively referred to as the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”. On August 25, 2021, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Stadco, pursuant to that certain stock purchase agreement with Acquisition Sub, Stadco Acquisition, LLC, Stadco and each equity holder of Stadco Acquisition, LLC. On the closing date, the Company, through Acquisition Sub, acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Stadco from Stadco Acquisition, LLC in exchange for the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock to Stadco Acquisition, LLC. As a result of the acquisition, Stadco is now our wholly owned indirect subsidiary. See Note 3 for additional disclosures related to this business combination. We manufacture large-scale metal fabricated and machined precision components and equipment. These products are used in a variety of markets including defense and aerospace, nuclear, medical, and precision industrial. All our operations and customers are in the United States, or “U.S.”. ​ NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Consolidation -
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TechPrecision, Ranor, Stadco, WCH, Acquisition Sub, and WCMC, until its dissolution. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and stockholders’ equity for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are unaudited, but, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial statements for interim periods in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or “U.S. GAAP”. All
7
Table of Contents adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature, except as otherwise disclosed. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the fiscal year. These notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the “SEC”, for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 10, 2022. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements -
In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical and current experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Risks and Uncertainties -
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no events related to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) that had a material impact on our operations. The Company will continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and any government-imposed actions thereto. We reported a net loss of $ 0.1
million for the six months ended September 30, 2022. We reported a net loss of $ 0.3
million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Our liquidity is highly dependent on the availability of financing facilities and our ability to maintain our gross profit and operating income. Berkshire Bank waived the Company’s noncompliance with certain of the financial and related covenants at September 30, 2022. In our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we disclosed our intention to secure new long-term financing on terms consistent with our near-term business plans for us to continue operations beyond the next twelve months and be able to discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. On December 23, 2022, we were successful extending the maturity date of the Ranor Term Loan to December 2027 and renewing the Revolver Loan for one year (each as defined below; see Note 12 – Debt). Additionally, we were able to meet certain financial and related loan covenants that the Company had failed in the prior quarter. As such, the uncertainty with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern has been alleviated. ​ NOTE 3 – BUSINESS COMBINATION Stadco Acquisition On August 25, 2021, the closing date, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Stadco, pursuant to that certain stock purchase agreement, dated as of October 16, 2020, or the “SPA”, among TechPrecision, Acquisition Sub, Stadco Acquisition, LLC, or “Holdco”, and each stockholder of Holdco. Stadco is a company in the business of manufacturing high-precision parts, assemblies and tooling for aerospace, defense, and industrial customers. Also on the closing date, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of certain indebtedness obligations of Stadco, pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of April 23, 2021, with Sunflower Bank, N.A., as amended by Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2021, together, the “Loan Purchase Agreement”. On August 25, 2021, WCH, as assignee of Acquisition Sub, paid $ 7.9
million in the aggregate to Sunflower Bank, N.A., under the terms of the Loan Purchase Agreement, to purchase the indebtedness. Pursuant to the SPA, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Stadco in exchange for the issuance of
666,666
shares of the Company’s common stock to Holdco.
In connection with the acquisition of Stadco, the Company reached an agreement with the holders of certain other non-bank indebtedness of Stadco, under which each such lender agreed to forgive such indebtedness in exchange for an aggregate of
199,395
shares of the Company’s common stock. In addition, the Company reached an agreement with a certain other security holder who agreed to sell its Stadco securities to the Company in exchange for the issuance by the Company of
600,000
shares of the Company’s common stock and a warrant to purchase
100,000
shares of the Company’s common stock.  The fair value of the
1,466,061
shares of common stock issued as aggregate consideration was $ 2.3
million based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the August 25, 2021 closing date. The fair value of the warrants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The warrants vested in full on the issue date, have a
three-year
term and exercise price of $ 1.43
per share. The fair value of the warrants was $ 46,256
and estimated using the Black- 8
Table of Contents Scholes option-pricing model based on the closing stock prices at the grant date and the weighted average assumptions specific to the grant. Expected volatility of
46.7 % was based on the historical volatility of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate of
0.4 % was selected based upon yields of three-year U.S. Treasury bond. On August 25, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with a limited number of institutional and other accredited investors, pursuant to which investors committed to subscribe for and purchase
3,202,727
shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $ 1.10
per share. Costs directly attributable to this offering of securities totaled $ 0.3
million.
Stadco’s assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair values on August 25, 2021, primarily using Level 1 and Level 3 inputs. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate and require a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties. Third-party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of these assets and liabilities. Included in the total consideration transferred is $ 113,890
related to a contingent provision in the agreements that required payment based on the difference between the TechPrecision stock price and contract target stock price. The contingent provision allowed the issuer, TechPrecision, to settle the contingency with stock or cash, or a combination of each. If after one year following the closing of the acquisition, the fair value of the consideration stock was less than the target stock price stated in each agreement, TechPrecision was to issue to the holder additional shares of consideration stock or cash, or some combination of stock and cash. The target stock price stated in the agreements was guaranteed and only the number of shares issued could vary, with the final measurement date and amount determined on the one-year anniversary date. Since the contract did not specify a fixed maximum number of shares to be issued on the anniversary date, had the company determined to satisfy the contingent consideration with shares only, then a number of shares higher than the amount currently authorized by the company’s certificate of incorporation could have been required to be issued. In any case, the maximum value of the contingent consideration was $ 2,269,000 , whether paid in shares of common stock or in cash, or both. The Company settled the obligation associated with the contingent consideration on August 25, 2022 by issuing
36,509
shares of common stock valued at $ 56,310
on August 25, 2022. The fair value of the contingent consideration was based on the closing stock price on the issuance date. Measurement Period Adjustments The Company has completed the process of measuring the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, the Company made certain measurement period adjustments to reflect the facts and circumstances in existence at the acquisition date. These measurement period adjustments are related to changes in preliminary assumptions and initial estimates that would have been recognized if all the facts and circumstances had been known at the time of acquisition. The table below presents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date based on the best information it has received to date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Adjusted ​ ​ Reported at ​ ERTC ​ Customer ​ Fixed ​ Totals ​ ​ August 25, ​ refundable ​ claim 2

The period over which the Company performs its obligations can be between
three
and
thirty-six months .Revenue is recognized over-time or at a point-in-time given the terms and conditions of the related contracts. The Company utilizes an inputs methodology based on estimated labor hours to measure performance progress. This model best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. The Company’s contract portfolio is comprised of fixed-price contracts and provide for product type sales only.

8,350,231 ​ ​ NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740,
Income Taxes . The tax provision for interim periods is determined using the estimated annual effective consolidated tax rate, based on the current estimate of full-year earnings before taxes, adjusted for the impact of discrete quarterly items. The Company recorded income tax expense of $ 8,786
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and an income tax expense of $ 46,991
for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was
27.0 %. The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was approximately $ 2.0
million at December 31, 2022. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating losses, or NOLs, carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event future taxable income is below management’s estimates or is generated in tax jurisdictions different than projected, the Company could be required to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in the Company’s effective tax rate. ​ 11

The 2016 Plan provides for a share reserve of
5,000,000
shares of common stock. The 2016 Plan authorizes the award of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance awards to employees, directors, consultants, and other individuals who provide services to TechPrecision or its affiliates. The purpose of the 2016 Plan is to: (a) enable TechPrecision and its affiliated companies to recruit and retain highly qualified employees, directors and consultants; (b) provide those employees, directors and consultants with an incentive for productivity; and (c) provide those employees, directors and consultants with an opportunity to share in the growth and value of the Company. Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2016 Plan, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued with respect to awards under the 2016 Plan is
5,000,000
shares (inclusive of awards issued under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the “2006 Plan”, that remained outstanding as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan). Shares of our common stock subject to awards that expire unexercised or are otherwise forfeited shall again be available for awards under the 2016 Plan. At December 31, 2022, there were
1,250,000
shares available for grant under the 2016 Plan.

​ ​ Board of Directors Common Stock Award ​ On September 15, 2022, the board of directors granted each non-employee director
25,000
shares of common stock for a total of
100,000
shares of common stock in the aggregate, of fully vested stock awards under the Plan in recognition of such directors’ service and in lieu of the annual grant to purchase Company common stock previously approved by the Board as annual director compensation. The fair value of the award was $ 144,000
based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. ​ Restricted Stock Awards Our board periodically authorizes the issuance of restricted stock as service-based awards measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock. The shares of restricted stock fully vest and cease to be subject to forfeiture one year from the grant date. Each grantee is required to have been serving as a director on the vesting date and must have been continuously serving in such capacity from the grant date through the vesting date for the shares of restricted stock to vest. Prior to the vesting date, the grantee is not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise encumber the shares of restricted stock and if the grantee’s service with the Company has terminated prior to the vesting date, subject to certain exceptions, the grantee’s restricted stock is forfeited automatically. On September 17, 2021, we granted a total of
100,000
shares of restricted stock under the 2016 Plan to the members of the board of directors. The stock-based compensation expense of
$ 175,000
for service-based restricted stock was measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock. On January 24, 2022, the board of directors, in recognition of their special efforts in completing the previously disclosed acquisition of Stadco, granted (a) an aggregate total of
20,000
shares of restricted stock under the Company’s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and (b) a cash award of $ 35,000 , to each of Alexander Shen, the Company’s chief executive officer, and Thomas Sammons, the Company’s chief financial officer. The shares were measured at fair value at $ 34,000
on the date of grant based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock. The shares of restricted stock fully vested and ceased to be subject to forfeiture on January 24, 2023. Each grantee was required to have been serving as an executive officer on the vesting date and must have been continuously serving in such capacity from the grant date through the vesting date for the shares of restricted stock to vest. Prior to the vesting date, the grantee was not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise encumber the shares of restricted stock and if the grantee’s service with the Company had terminated prior to the vesting date, the grantee’s restricted stock would have been forfeited automatically, subject to certain exceptions. Total recognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, was
$ 8,663
and
$ 107,309 , respectively. On December 31, 2022, there was
$ 1,770
of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards. ​ 13

3,114,936 ​ Stadco Term Loan On August 25, 2021, Stadco borrowed $ 4,000,000
from Berkshire Bank, or the “Stadco Term Loan”. Interest on the Stadco Term Loan is due on unpaid balances at a fixed rate per annum equal to the
seven-year
Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Classic Advance Rate plus  2.25 %. Since September 25, 2021, and on the 25th day of each month thereafter, Stadco has made and will make monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $ 54,390
each, with all outstanding principal and accrued interest due and payable on August 25, 2028. Interest shall be calculated based on actual days elapsed and a 360-day year. The Company is required to pay a late charge in the amount of
5 % of each payment due under the Stadco Term Loan (other than the balloon payment due at maturity) that is more than ten days in arrears. In addition, from and after the date on which the Stadco Term Loan becomes, or at Berkshire Bank’s option, could become due and payable (whether accelerated or not), at maturity, upon default or otherwise, interest shall accrue and shall be immediately due and payable at the default rate equal to
5 % per annum greater than the interest rate otherwise in effect, but in no event higher than the maximum interest rate permitted by law. Unamortized debt issue costs at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 were $ 48,513
and $ 71,617 , respectively. Ranor Term Loan The “Ranor Term Loan” was originally made to Ranor by Berkshire Bank in 2016 in the amount of $ 2.85
million. Payments began on January 20, 2017 and were made in monthly installments of $ 19,260
each, inclusive of interest at a fixed rate of
5.21 % per annum, with all outstanding principal and accrued interest due and payable on the maturity date. On December 17, 2021, Ranor and certain affiliates of the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and First Amendment to Promissory Note to extend the maturity date of the Ranor Term Loan from December 20, 2021 to March 18, 2022. 15
Table of Contents On March 18, 2022, Ranor and certain affiliates of the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Second Amendment to Promissory Note to further extend the maturity date of the Ranor Term Loan to June 16, 2022. On June 16, 2022, Ranor and certain affiliates of the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Third Amendment to the Promissory Note to further extend the maturity date of the Ranor Term Loan to September 16, 2022. On September 15, 2022, Ranor and certain affiliates of the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Fourth Amendment to the Promissory Note to further extend the maturity date of the Ranor Term Loan to December 15, 2022. On December 23, 2022, Ranor and certain affiliates of the Company entered into a Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, Fifth Amendment to Promissory Note and First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note, or the “Amendment”. Effective as of December 20, 2022, the Amendment, among other things (i) extends the maturity date of the Ranor Term Loan to December 15, 2027, (ii) extends the maturity date of the Revolver Loan from December 20, 2022 to December 20, 2023, (iii) increases the interest rate on the Ranor Term Loan from
5.21 % to
6.05 % per annum, (iv) decreases the monthly payment on the Ranor Term Loan from $ 19,260
to $ 16,601 , (v) replaces LIBOR as an option for the benchmark interest rate for the Revolver Loan with SOFR, (vi) replaces LIBOR-based interest pricing conventions with SOFR-based pricing conventions, including benchmark replacement provisions, and (vii) solely with respect to the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, lowers the debt service coverage ratio from at least
1.2
to 1.0 to
1.1
to 1.0. In accordance with the amended loan agreement, the maximum amount that can now be borrowed under the Revolver loan is $ 5.0
million. Advances under the Revolver Loan are subject to a borrowing base equal to the lesser of (a) $ 5.0
million or (b) the sum of (i) 80 % of the net outstanding amount of Base Accounts, plus (ii) the lesser of (x)
25 % of Eligible Raw Material Inventory, and (y) $ 250,000 , plus (iii)
80 % of the Appraised Value of the Eligible Equipment, as such terms are defined in the amended and restated loan agreement among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, and Berkshire Bank, dated August 25, 2021 (the “Loan Agreement”). The Company agrees to pay to Berkshire Bank, as consideration for Berkshire Bank’s agreement to make the Revolver Loan available, a nonrefundable Revolver Loan fee equal to
0.25 % per annum (computed based on a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) on the difference between the amount of: (a) $ 5.0
million, and (b) the average daily outstanding balance of the Revolver Loan during the quarterly period then ended. All Revolver Loan fees are payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each January, April, July and October and on the Revolver Maturity Date, or upon acceleration of the Revolver Loan, if earlier. Under the amended promissory note for the Revolver Loan, the Company can elect to pay interest at an adjusted SOFR-based rate or an Adjusted Prime Rate. The minimum adjusted LIBOR-based rate is
2.75 % and the Adjusted Prime Rate is the greater of (i) the Prime Rate minus
70
basis points or (ii)
2.75 %. Interest-only payments on advances made under the Revolver Loan will continue to be payable monthly in arrears. The LIBOR-based rate expired on December 20, 2022. There was approximately $ 1.5
million outstanding under the Revolver Loan at December 31, 2022. Interest payments made under the Revolver Loan were $ 20,769
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 was
4.41 % and
2.67 %, respectively. Unused borrowing capacity at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 was approximately $ 3.5
million and $ 2.8
million, respectively. Unamortized debt issue costs at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 were $ 103,376
and $ 76,288 , respectively. Berkshire Loan Covenants For purposes of this discussion, Ranor and Stadco are referred to together as the “Borrowers”. The Ranor Term Loan, the Stadco Term Loan and the Revolver Loan, or together, the “Berkshire Loans”, may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any of certain default events, at the option of Berkshire Bank, or automatically without notice or any other action upon the occurrence of any event specified in the Loan Agreement, the unpaid principal amount of the Loans and the Notes together with accrued interest and all other obligations owing by the Borrowers to Berkshire Bank would become immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest, or further notice of any kind. 16
Table of Contents The Borrowers agree to maintain the ratio of the Cash Flow of TechPrecision to the Total Debt Service of TechPrecision of not less than
1.20
to
1.00 , (except for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, in which case such ratio of Cash Flow to Total Debt Service shall not be less than
1.10
to
1.00 ), measured quarterly on the last day of each fiscal quarter or-annual period of TechPrecision on a trailing twelve (12) month basis, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending as of September 30, 2021. Calculations will be based on the audited (year-end) and unaudited (quarterly) consolidated financial statements of TechPrecision. Quarterly tests will be measured based on the financial statements included in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q within sixty days of the end of each quarter, and annual tests will be measured based on the financial statements included in the Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K within one hundred twenty days after the end of each fiscal annual period. Cash Flow means an amount, without duplication, equal to the sum of net income of TechPrecision plus (i) interest expense, plus (ii) taxes, plus (iii) depreciation and amortization, plus (iv) stock-based compensation expense taken by TechPrecision, plus (v) non-cash losses and charges and one time or non-recurring expenses at Berkshire Bank’s discretion, less (vi) the amount of cash distributions, if any, made to shareholders or owners of TechPrecision, less (vii) cash taxes paid by the TechPrecision, all as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Total Debt Service shall mean an amount, without duplication, equal to the sum of (i) all amounts of cash interest paid on liabilities, obligations and reserves of TechPrecision paid by TechPrecision, (ii) all amounts paid by TechPrecision in connection with current maturities of long-term debt and preferred dividends, and (iii) all payments on account of capitalized leases, all as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Borrowers agree to cause their Balance Sheet Leverage to be less than or equal
2.50
to
1.00 . Compliance with the foregoing shall be tested quarterly, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrowers, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021. Balance Sheet Leverage means, at any date of determination, the ratio of Borrowers’ (a) Total Liabilities, less Subordinated Debt, to (b) Net Worth, plus Subordinated Debt. The Borrowers agree that their combined annual capital expenditures shall not exceed $ 1.5
million. Compliance shall be tested annually, commencing with the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. The Borrowers agree to maintain a Loan-to-Value Ratio of not greater than
0.75
to
1.00 . Loan-to-Value Ratio means the ratio of (a) the sum of the outstanding balance of the Ranor Term Loan and the Stadco Term Loan, to (b) the fair market value of the property pledged as collateral for the loan, as determined by an appraisal obtained from time to time by Berkshire Bank, but not more frequently than one time during each
365 day
period (provided that Berkshire Bank may obtain an appraisal at any time after either the Ranor Term Loan or the Stadco Term Loan has been accelerated), which appraisals shall be at the expense of the Borrowers. The Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022. Collateral securing all the above obligations comprises all personal and real property of the Company, including cash, accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, and financial assets. The Company’s short-term and long-term debt is all privately held with no public market for this debt and is considered to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. ​ The scheduled principal maturities for our total debt by calendar year: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2023      $ 2,069,859 2024 ​   618,889 2025 ​   645,305 2026 ​   672,179 2027 ​   2,650,200 Thereafter ​   428,918 Total ​ $ 7,085,350 ​ ​ NOTE 13 - OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES The Company purchased new equipment in fiscal 2022 for contract project work with a certain customer. Under an addendum to the contract purchase orders, that customer agreed to reimburse the Company for the cost of the new equipment. We received the first payment in January 2022 and two additional payments in April 2022. In case of a contract breach, at the time of the breach, the customer may claw back the funds based on a prorated ten-year straight-line annual declining balance recovery period.

two
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ranor and Stadco that are reportable segments. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. All of the Company’s operations, assets, and customers are located in the U.S. Each reportable segment focuses on the manufacture and assembly of specific components, primarily for defense, aerospace and other industrial customers. However, both segments have separate operating, engineering, and sales teams. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, or “CODM”, evaluates the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs. Corporate costs include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, and other corporate and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. The segment operating profit metric is what the CODM uses in evaluating our results of operations and the financial measure that provides insight into our overall performance and financial position. 19

Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance . The amendments in this update require the following annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy: 1) information about the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions, 2) the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected by the transactions, and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item, 3) significant terms and conditions of the transactions, including commitments and contingencies. The adoption of this ASU on April 1, 2022 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures. In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04,
Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options.
The FASB issued this update to clarify and reduce diversity in issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. The amendments that relate to the recognition and measurement of EPS for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options affect entities that present EPS in accordance with the guidance in Topic 260,

Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Statement Regarding Forward Looking Disclosure The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, which appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including this section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” may contain predictive or “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this quarterly report, including statements that express our intentions, plans, objectives, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions, or any other statements relating to our future activities or other future events, or conditions are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections made by management about our business, our industry and other conditions affecting our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause such outcomes and results to differ include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties arising from: ● our reliance on individual purchase orders, rather than long-term contracts, to generate revenue; ● our ability to balance the composition of our revenues and effectively control operating expenses; ● external factors that may be outside our control: including the Russia – Ukraine conflict, price inflation, interest rates increases, and supply chain inefficiencies; ● the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed lockdowns in response thereto; ● the availability of appropriate financing facilities impacting our operations, financial condition and/or liquidity; ● our ability to receive contract awards through competitive bidding processes; ● our ability to maintain standards to enable us to manufacture products to exacting specifications; ● our ability to enter new markets for our services; ● our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our business; ● competitive pressures in the markets we serve; ● changes in the availability or cost of raw materials and energy for our production facilities; ● restrictions in our ability to operate our business due to our outstanding indebtedness; ● government regulations and requirements; ● pricing and business development difficulties; ● changes in government spending on national defense; ● our ability to make acquisitions and successfully integrate those acquisitions with our business; ● our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; ● general industry and market conditions and growth rates; ● unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the recently completed acquisition of Stadco; and ● those risks discussed in “ Item 1A. Risk Factors ” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those described in any other filings which we make with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as required by applicable law. Investors should evaluate any statements made by us in light of these important factors. 21
Table of Contents Overview Contract Manufacturing Through our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ranor and Stadco (acquired on August 25, 2021), each of which is a reportable segment, we offer a full range of services required to transform raw materials into precision finished products. Our manufacturing capabilities include fabrication operations (cutting, press and roll forming, assembly, welding, heat treating, blasting, and painting) and machining operations including CNC (computer numerical controlled) horizontal and vertical milling centers. We also provide support services to our manufacturing capabilities: manufacturing engineering (planning, fixture and tooling development, manufacturing), quality control (inspection and testing), materials procurement, production control (scheduling, project management and expediting) and final assembly. All manufacturing is done in accordance with our written quality assurance program, which meets specific national and international codes, standards, and specifications. The standards used are specific to the customers’ needs, and our manufacturing operations are conducted in accordance with these standards. Because our revenues are derived from the sale of goods manufactured pursuant to contracts, and we do not sell from inventory, it is necessary for us to constantly seek new contracts. There may be a time lag between our completion of one contract and commencement of work on another contract. During such periods, we may continue to incur overhead expense but with lower revenue resulting in lower operating margins. Furthermore, changes in either the scope of an existing contract or related delivery schedules may impact the revenue we receive under the contract and the allocation of manpower. Although we provide manufacturing services for large governmental programs, we usually do not work directly for the government or its agencies. Rather, we perform our services for large governmental contractors. Our business is dependent in part on the continuation of governmental programs that require our services and products. Our contracts are generated both through negotiation with the customer and from bids made pursuant to a request for proposal. Our ability to receive contract awards is dependent upon the contracting party’s perception of such factors as our ability to perform on time, our history of performance, including quality, our financial condition, and our ability to price our services competitively. Although some of our contracts contemplate the manufacture of one or a limited number of units, we continue to seek more long-term projects with predictable cost structures. All the Company’s operations, assets, and customers are located in the U.S. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic At the beginning of calendar year 2020, the novel strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 spread worldwide, including to U.S jurisdictions where the Company does business, and became a global pandemic. The United States Government declared a national emergency and various state governments imposed “lockdown” and “shelter-in-place” orders intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19 that have severely restricted business, social activities and travel during the periods in which they were imposed. The Governors of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and State of California, in which jurisdictions the Company’s manufacturing and executive offices are located, issued similar emergency orders in March 2020. Although the emergency order for Massachusetts has expired, the national emergency declaration was renewed on July 15, 2022 and the California emergency order remains in effect through February 2023. As a designated “COVID-19 Essential Service” we continued our operations throughout the pendency of the orders. Our production facilities continue to operate as they had prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, other than the implementation of enhanced safety measures intended to prevent the spread of the virus. The remote working arrangements and travel restrictions imposed by applicable governmental authorities during 2020 and 2021 did not impair our ability to maintain operations. Our results of operations and cash flows during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 were not materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.However, given the speed and frequency of continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic, the extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects, we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of future impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 22
Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and income taxes. These estimates and assumptions require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Actual results may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We consider the principles and estimates applied for revenue recognition to be one of the most critical accounting estimates that we make. Our revenue can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as we measure revenue recognition over the duration of a project, or at the end of the project. The Company records most of its revenue over time as it completes performance obligations or at a point-in-time, for example, at the delivery date, when control of the promised goods are transferred to the customer. Project volume for revenue recognized at a point-in-time is generally smaller, can fluctuate from period to period, and is difficult to forecast. We measure progress for performance obligations satisfied over time using input methods, for example, labor hours expended and time elapsed. As a result, assuming a steady flow of project volume and labor hours, we have the ability to deliver a fair and accurate flow of revenue over time. When project volume is higher or lower, we may report higher or lower amounts of revenue for those given quarterly periods. Our significant accounting policies are set forth in detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. New Accounting Standards See Note 17, Accounting Standards Update, in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under “ Item 1. Financial Statements ”, for a discussion of recently adopted new accounting guidance and new accounting guidance not yet adopted. Results of Operations Our results of operations are affected by a number of external factors including the availability of raw materials, commodity prices (particularly steel), macroeconomic factors, including the availability of capital that may be needed by our customers, and political, regulatory and legal conditions in the United States and in foreign markets. It generally takes approximately twelve months or less to complete our manufacturing projects. However, contracts for larger complex components can take up to thirty-six months to complete. Units manufactured under the majority of our customer contracts have historically been delivered on time and with a positive gross margin, with some exceptions. Our results of operations are also affected by our success in booking new contracts, the timing of revenue recognition, delays in customer acceptances of our products, delays in deliveries of ordered products and our rate of progress fulfilling obligations under our contracts. A delay in deliveries or cancellations of orders could have an unfavorable impact on liquidity, cause us to have inventories in excess of our short-term needs, and delay our ability to recognize, or prevent us from recognizing, revenue on contracts in our order backlog. We evaluate the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also excluded are items that we consider not representative of ongoing operations, such as the unallocated PPP loan forgiveness and refundable employee retention tax credits. 23
Table of Contents Key Performance Indicators While we prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “U.S. GAAP”, we also utilize and present certain financial measures that are not based on or included in U.S. GAAP. We refer to these as non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the section titled “ EBITDA Non-GAAP financial measure ” below for further discussion of these financial measures, including the reasons why we use such financial measures and reconciliations of such financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Percentages in the following tables and throughout this “ Results of Operations”

Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $8.3 million, or 28% million higher when compared to the same period a year ago. A favorable project mix at Ranor provided the boost for the increase in third quarter revenue. Ranor -
Net sales were $4.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, or 70% higher when compared to the same prior year period. Net sales to defense customers increased by $2.1 million. Net sales increased primarily on profitable orders for repeat defense industry business which contributed to a favorable project mix in the period. The defense backlog for Ranor remains strong as new orders for components related to a variety of programs, including U.S. Navy submarine programs, continue to flow down from our existing customer base of prime defense contractors. Net sales to precision industrial markets decreased by $0.2 million due to lower project activity. Order flow in this sector can be uneven and difficult to forecast. Stadco -
Net sales were $3.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net sales of $3.7 million for the same quarter a year ago. We have a strong defense backlog at Stadco for new orders related to a variety of programs, including components for heavy lift helicopters. Cost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Consolidated -
Cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials, parts, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our cost of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was 13% higher when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, the result of increased direct labor hours charged to jobs at Ranor because of the increased level of job activity, and under-absorbed factory overhead at Stadco. Gross profit was $1.0 million higher when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin was 18% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 7.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. 24
Table of Contents Ranor -
Gross profit and gross margin increased year over year on improved throughput, profitable repeat business, and a favorable project mix. This set of production conditions resulted in better overhead absorption rates which began to take hold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Stadco -
The gross margin turned negative at the end of fiscal year 2022 and continued through the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Certain unprofitable projects and new project startups slowed production activities and resulted in unfavorable throughput and under-absorbed overhead. These conditions have resulted in unfavorable factory overhead absorption rates since the acquisition date in August 2021. ​ Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022      December 31, 2021      Changes   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Percent of  ​ ​ ​ ​ Percent of  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​   (dollars in thousands) ​ Amount      Net Sales ​ Amount      Net Sales ​ Amount      Percent   Ranor ​ $

Outside advisory service fees in the prior year period included one-time costs for legal, accounting, and other outside advisory services.
Ranor –
Lower headcount and reduced business travel led to lower spending for compensation and other office costs of approximately $40,000 and $60,000, respectively. Reduction in travel ($25,000) and lower insurance costs ($25,000) were the primary drivers of the office costs decrease. Stadco -
A decrease of $0.1 million was due to lower compensation expenses, the result of lower headcount, and the cost of insurance. Corporate and unallocated -

–
Operating income was $1.6 million higher compared to same period prior year, due primarily to profitable repeat business and a favorable project mix and continued improved operating throughput which resulted in better factory overhead absorption.
Stadco
–
New project startups, certain poorly priced legacy projects, and related production issues, resulted in an operating loss of $0.6 million.

20 % ​ Interest expense was higher for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to new borrowings under the Revolver Loan (each as defined below). We expect to see higher interest expense in future periods due to higher interest rates on the extended Ranor Term Loan and renewed Revolver Loan. Amortization of debt issue costs were lower when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. However, new amortization periods commenced in December 2022 for costs incurred to extend the Ranor Term Loan and renew the Revolver Loan renewal. As a result, we expect to see higher amortization expense in future periods. Other income, net, in the table above, reflects lower interest income earned for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded tax expense of $46,991. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $333,867 in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 was approximately $2.0 million. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we continue to provide a valuation allowance on these items. In the event future taxable income is below management’s estimates or is generated in tax jurisdictions different than projected, the Company could be required to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in the Company’s effective tax rate. Net Income (Loss) As a result of the foregoing, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded net income of $0.1 million, compared with net loss of $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Table of Contents Net Sales Consolidated -
Net sales were $23.9 million or 63% higher when compared to consolidated net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Net sales increased due to $4.5 million of new revenue from our Stadco segment and $4.7 revenue increase at our Ranor segment. The prior year results only included eighteen weeks of business activity at Stadco. Ranor -
Net sales were $14.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, or 48% higher when compared to the same prior year period. Net sales increased primarily on profitable orders of repeat business which contributed to a favorable project mix for the year-to-date period. Net sales to defense customers increased by $5.4 million. The defense backlog for Ranor remains strong as new orders for components related to a variety of programs, including the U.S. Navy submarine programs, continue to flow down from our existing customer base of prime defense contractors. Net sales to precision industrial markets decreased by $0.7 million due to lower project activity. We have repeat business in this sector, but the order flow can be uneven and difficult to forecast. Stadco -
Net sales were $9.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 were $5.0 million but only included eighteen weeks of business activity following the August 25, 2021 acquisition date. Our defense backlog for Stadco remains strong with new orders for components related to a variety of programs, including components for heavy lift helicopters. Cost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Consolidated -
Cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials, parts, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our cost of sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, was $7.4 million higher when compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of a full thirty-nine weeks of business activity at our Stadco segment when compared to only eighteen weeks in the same period a year ago. Gross profit increased by $1.8 million, or 81% when compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, following a strong operating performance at Ranor, which more than offset weak operating results at Stadco. Gross margin was 17.0% versus 15.2% year-over-year. Ranor -
The gross profit and gross margin significantly increased year over year with improved throughput on new orders of profitable repeat business. This set of favorable conditions began to take hold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and accelerated project progress with better overhead absorption rates. We expect this trend to continue in future periods. Stadco -
The gross profit and gross margin turned negative at the end of fiscal year 2022 and continued through the third quarter of fiscal 2023. New projects with associated startup activities and certain unprofitable projects resulted in unfavorable throughput and under-absorbed overhead. We expect a gradual improvement in gross margin as the new projects progress with better throughput in future periods.

As a result of the foregoing, including the integration and reduced profitability at Stadco, we reported an operating loss of $0.4 million compared to operating loss of $1.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Our operating losses have narrowed recently, due to favorable operating results at Ranor, and incremental operating improvement at Stadco. Ranor –
Operating income was $3.5 million higher compared to same prior year period, due primarily to a profitable project mix and improved operating throughput. Stadco -
New project startups with related production activities led to unfavorable throughput and unabsorbed overhead that resulted in an operating loss of $2.8 million. The prior year period only included eighteen weeks of business activity at Stadco. Corporate and unallocated -
Corporate expenses were lower for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as the savings from the absence of integration and acquisition costs in connection with the Stadco acquisition in fiscal 2022 more than offset an increase in share-based compensation and office costs. ​ Other Income (Expense) The following table presents information for the nine months ended December 31: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      2022      2021      $ Change      % Change   Other income, net ​ $

Other income for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, includes a return of $10,000 for a retainer fee previously paid for outside advisory fees in connection with a class action settlement in March 2021. Interest expense was higher for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to borrowings under the Stadco Term Loan (as defined below) and higher amounts borrowed under the Revolver Loan. We also expect to see higher interest expense in comparable future periods due to higher interest rates on the extended Ranor Term Loan and renewed Revolver Loan. 28
Table of Contents Amortization of debt issue costs were higher when compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. New amortization periods commenced in December 2022 for costs incurred to extend the Ranor Term Loan and renew the Revolver Loan. As a result, we expect to see higher amortization expense in future periods.
Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) Other income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, includes an accrual of $624,045 for a refundable Employee Retention Tax Credit authorized under the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act for eligible employers with qualified wages. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan Forgiveness Included in the results for the nine-months ended December 31, 2021, is $1.3 million for forgiveness of the Company’s PPP loan. As authorized by Section 1106 of the CARES Act, the Small Business Administration remitted to Berkshire Bank, the lender of record, a payment of principal for $1.3 million. The funds credited to the PPP loan paid this loan off in full. Income Taxes For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a tax expense of $8,786, and for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $385,749. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 was approximately $2.0 million. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we continue to provide a valuation allowance on these items. In the event future taxable income is below management’s estimates or is generated in tax jurisdictions different than projected, the Company could be required to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in the Company’s effective tax rate. Net Income As a result of the foregoing, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded net income of $23,754, compared with net income of $0.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity is highly dependent on the availability of financing facilities and our ability to maintain gross profit and operating income. As of December 31, 2022, we had $3.8 million in total available liquidity, consisting of $0.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $3.5 million in undrawn capacity under our Revolver Loan. As of March 31, 2022, we had $3.9 million in total available liquidity, consisting of $1.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $2.8 million in undrawn capacity under our Revolver Loan. On December 23, 2022, Ranor and certain affiliates of the Company entered into a Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, Fifth Amendment to Promissory Note and First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note, or the “Amendment”. Effective as of December 20, 2022, the Amendment, among other things (i) extends the maturity date of the loan originally made to Ranor by Berkshire Bank in 2016, or the “Ranor Term Loan” to December 15, 2027, (ii) extends the maturity date of the Revolver Loan from December 20, 2022 to December 20, 2023, (iii) increases the interest rate on the Ranor Term Loan from 5.21% to 6.05% per annum, (iv) decreases the monthly payment on the Ranor Term Loan from $19,260 to $16,601, (v) replaces LIBOR as an option for the benchmark interest rate for the Revolver Loan with SOFR, (vi) replaces LIBOR-based interest pricing conventions with SOFR-based pricing conventions, including benchmark replacement provisions, and (vii) solely with respect to the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, lowers the debt service coverage ratio from at least 1.2 to 1.0 to 1.1 to 1.0. Our capital expenditures are limited to $1.5 million annually and contain loan-to-value, and balance sheet leverage covenants. There was approximately $1.5 million outstanding under the Revolver Loan at December 31, 2022. Interest payments made under the Revolver Loan were $20,769 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2022
29
Table of Contents and March 31, 2022 was 4.41% and 2.67%, respectively. Unused borrowing capacity at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 was approximately $3.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2022 our working capital was $7.2 million, an increase compared to $2.8 million at March 31, 2022. The Company was in compliance with all of the financial and related covenants on December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
​ We believe our available cash, plus cash expected to be provided by operations, refundable Employee Retention Tax Credits, and borrowing capacity available under the Revolver Loan, will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, and principal and interest payments under our lease and debt obligations through the next 12 months from the issuance date of our financial statements. We intend to refinance that Revolver Loan with Berkshire Bank at the next expiration date.

825 ​ Operating activities Apart from our loan facilities, our primary sources of cash are from accounts receivable collections. Our customers make advance payments and progress payments under the terms of each manufacturing contract. Our cash flows can fluctuate significantly from period to period as we mark progress with customer projects and the composition of our accounts receivable collections mix changes between advance and progress payments, and customer payments made after shipment of finished goods. The nine month period ended December 31, 2022, was generally marked by favorable project performance progress and delivery schedules that led to timely customer payments. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.9 million, as customer cash advances and collections exceeded cash outflows on both short and long duration projects in-progress. Cash used in operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was $1.6 million. Investing activities In fiscal 2023, we invested approximately $1.3 million in new factory machinery and equipment through the nine months ended December 31, 2022. We are limited by our financial debt covenants and may not spend more than $1.5 million for new machinery and equipment in the fiscal year. In fiscal 2022, we paid $7.8 million to acquire the Stadco business in August 2021 and purchased $0.4 million of new equipment for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Financing activities During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we drew down $6.7 million of proceeds under the Revolver Loan and repaid $6.5 million during the same period. We also used $0.5 million of cash to pay down debt principal and make periodic lease payments and pay off certain lease obligations.

Table of Contents For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we raised approximately $7.2 million from the sale of stock and new debt borrowings to finance the Stadco acquisition and related closing costs. In addition, we drew down $2.5 million under the Revolver Loan used to fund the acquisition of Stadco and various operating activities since August 25, 2021, and repaid $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We also paid down principal of $0.7 million on our term debt and finance lease obligations and paid out $0.1 million in debt issue costs. All of the above activity resulted in a net decrease in cash of $0.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with a net decrease in cash of $1.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Berkshire Bank Loans On August 25, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated loan agreement with Berkshire Bank, or the “Loan Agreement”. Under the Loan Agreement, Berkshire Bank continues as lender of the Ranor Term Loan and the revolving line of credit, or the “Revolver Loan”. In addition, Berkshire Bank provided to Stadco a term loan in the original amount of $4.0 million, or the “Stadco Term Loan”. The proceeds of the original Ranor Term Loan of $2.85 million were previously used to refinance existing mortgage debt of Ranor. The proceeds of the Revolver Loan are used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. The proceeds of the Stadco Term Loan were to be used to support the acquisition of Stadco and refinance existing indebtedness of Stadco.
Payments for the original Ranor Term Loan began on January 20, 2017 and until the facility was amended in December 2022, the Company paid monthly installments of $19,260 each, inclusive of interest at a fixed rate of 5.21% per annum. Since the effectiveness of the Amendment, the Company now makes monthly installment payments of $16,601 each, inclusive of interest at a fixed rate of 6.05% per annum. All outstanding principal and accrued interest due and payable on the maturity date. Under the Loan Agreement, Berkshire Bank also makes available to Ranor a revolving line of credit with, following certain modifications, a maximum principal amount available of $5.0 million. The Company drew down $6.7 million under the Revolver Loan and repaid $6.5 million of principal during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. There was $1.5 million outstanding under the Revolver Loan at December 31, 2022. Interest-only payments on advances made under the Revolver Loan during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $20,769 at a weighted average interest rate of 4.41%. Unused borrowing capacity on December 31, 2022 was approximately $3.5 million. On August 25, 2021, Stadco borrowed $4,000,000 from Berkshire Bank under the Stadco Term Loan. Interest on the Stadco Term Loan is due on unpaid balances beginning on August 25, 2021, at a fixed rate per annum equal to the 7 year Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Classic Advance Rate plus 2.25%. Since September 25, 2021, and on the 25th day of each month thereafter, Stadco has made and will continue to make monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $54,390 each, with all outstanding principal and accrued interest due and payable on August 25, 2028.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following contractual obligations associated with our normal business activities are expected to result in cash payments in future periods, and include the following material items at December 31, 2022: ● Our long-term debt obligations, including fixed and variable-rate debt, totaled $7.1 million, with $2.0 million due as a balloon payment in 2027. In addition, approximately $0.6 million is due annually for each of the next six years. ● We enter into various commitments with suppliers for the purchase of raw materials and work supplies. Our outstanding unconditional contractual commitments, including for the purchase of raw materials and supplies goods, totaled $7.4 million, all of it due to be paid within the next twelve months. These purchase commitments are in the normal course of business. ● Our lease obligations, including imputed interest, totaled $7.2 million for buildings and equipment through 2030, with approximately $0.9 million due annually for each of the next eight years.
​ We believe our available cash, plus cash expected to be provided by operations, refundable Employee Retention Tax Credits, and borrowing capacity available under the Revolver Loan, will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, and

Table of Contents principal and interest payments under our lease and debt obligations through the next 12 months from the issuance date of our financial statements. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. ​ EBITDA Non-GAAP Financial Measure To complement our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, we use EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Net (loss) income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to EBITDA. We believe EBITDA provides our board of directors, management, and investors with a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We also believe that EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, and is a measure contained in our debt covenants. However, while we consider EBITDA to be an important measure of operating performance, EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements for periods ended:

As a smaller reporting company, we have elected not to provide the information required by this Item. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and includes controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 32
Table of Contents Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Material Weakness We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, which still existed as of December 31, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, management identified the following material weakness: we did not maintain proper controls, processes and procedures over the initial purchase accounting and the continuing fair value accounting associated with our acquisition of Stadco that were adequately designed, documented and executed to support the accurate and timely reporting of our financial results regarding the initial purchase accounting and the continuing fair value accounting associated with the Stadco acquisition. Notwithstanding the material weakness, management believes the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management’s Remediation Plan Our management, with the oversight of our audit committee, has initiated steps and plans to take additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weakness, which we currently believe will be primarily through the development and implementation of new procedures, policies, processes, including revising the precision level of management review controls and gaining additional assurance regarding timely completion of our quality control procedures. It is possible that we may determine that additional remediation steps will be necessary in the future. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We can provide no assurance as to when the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed to provide for an effective control environment. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as disclosed under “Management’s Remediation Plan”, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 33
