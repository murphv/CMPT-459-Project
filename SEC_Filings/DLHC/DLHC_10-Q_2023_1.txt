NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) December 31, 2022
1.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DLH Holdings Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (together with its subsidiaries, "DLH" or the "Company" and also referred to as "we," "us" and "our"). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
In management's opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending September 30, 2023 or any future period. Amounts as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are unaudited. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 5, 2022. 2.
Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to estimating revenues and costs including overhead and its allocation, estimating progress toward the completion of performance obligations, assessing fair value of acquired assets and liabilities accounted for through business acquisitions, valuing and determining the amortization periods for long-lived intangible assets, interest rate swaps, stock-based compensation, right-of-use assets and leases liabilities, and loss development on workers' compensation claims. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current and expected future outcomes, third-party evaluations, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. We revise material accounting estimates if changes occur, such as more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained, or there is new information on which an estimate was or can be based. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue The Company's revenues from contracts with customers are derived from offerings that include technology-enabled business process outsourcing, program management solutions, and public health research and analytics, substantially within the U.S. government and its agencies, and to a lesser extent, subcontractors. The Company has various types of contracts including time-and-materials contracts, cost-reimbursable contracts, and firm-fixed-price contracts. We consider a contract with a customer to exist when there is a commitment by both parties (customer and Company), payment terms are determinable, there is commercial substance, and collectability is probably in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("Topic 606"). We recognize revenue over time when there is a continuous transfer of control to our customer as performance obligations are satisfied. For our U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is transferred over time and revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress toward completion of the performance obligation. We consider control to transfer when we have a right to payment. In some instances, the Company commences providing services prior to formal approval to begin work from the customer. The Company considers these factors, the risks associated with commencing work, and legal enforceability in determining whether a contract exists under Topic 606. Contract modification can occur throughout the life of the contract and can affect the transaction price, extend the period of performance, adjust funding, or create new performance obligations. We review each modification to assess the impact of these
7 contract changes to determine if it should be treated as part of the original performance obligation or as a separate contract. Contract modifications impact performance obligations when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is recognized as an adjustment to revenue and profit cumulatively. Furthermore, a significant change in one or more estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts in the period identified. For service contracts, we satisfy our performance obligations as services are rendered. We use cost-based input and time-based output methods to measure progress based on the contract type. • Time and material
- We bill the customer per labor hour and per material, and revenue is recognized in the amount invoiced as the amount corresponds directly to the value of our performance to date. Revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus materials and other reimbursable costs incurred. • Cost reimbursable
- We record reimbursable costs as incurred, including an estimated share of the contractual fee earned. • Firm fixed price
- We recognize revenue over time using a straight-line measure of progress or percentage of completion method whereby progress toward completion is based on a comparison of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs to be incurred over the contract terms. Contract costs generally include direct costs such as labor, materials, subcontract costs, and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to a specific contract. Costs are expensed as incurred and include an estimate of the contractual fees earned. Contract costs incurred for U.S. government contracts, including indirect costs, are subject to audit and adjustment by various government audit agencies. Historically, our adjustments have not been material. Contract assets
- Amounts are invoiced as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms. In part, revenue recognition occurs before we have the right to bill, resulting in contract assets. These contract assets are reported within Accounts receivable, net on our consolidated balance sheets and are invoiced in accordance with payment terms defined in each contract. Period end balances will vary from period to period due to agreed-upon contractual terms. Contract liabilities
- Amounts are a result of billings in excess of costs incurred or prepayment for services to be rendered. Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, contract assets, contract liabilities, accrued expenses, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair values of the Company's debt instruments approximate fair value because the underlying interest rates approximate market rates that the Company could obtain for similar instruments at the balance sheet dates. Long-lived Assets Our long-lived assets include equipment and improvements, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, and goodwill. The Company continues to review long-lived assets for possible impairment or loss of value at least annually, or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit's carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Equipment and improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful asset lives ( 3
to
7
years) and the shorter of the initial lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are originally recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of
10
years. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
Right-of-use assets are measured at the present value of future minimum lease payments, including all probable renewals, plus lease payments made to the lessor before or at lease commencement and indirect costs paid, less incentives received. Our right-of-use assets include long-term leases for facilities and equipment and are amortized over their respective lease terms. 8 Lease Liabilities The Company has leases for facilities and office equipment. Our lease liabilities are recognized as the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Our lease payments consist of fixed and in-substance fixed amounts attributable to the use of the underlying asset over the lease term. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index rate or are not in-substance fixed payments are excluded in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and are expensed in the period incurred. The incremental borrowing rate on our secured term loan is used in determining the present value of future minimum lease payments. Some of our lease agreements include options to extend the lease term or terminate the lease. These options are accounted for in our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company will extend the lease term or terminate the lease. The Company does not have any finance leases. Goodwill The Company reviews goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on a quarterly basis the company assesses the impact of any macroeconomic changes that may impact the business conditions to determine if these changes have any adverse impact to goodwill. Notwithstanding this evaluation, factors including non-renewal of a major contract or other substantial changes in business conditions could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of goodwill in future periods and the resulting charge could be material to future periods’ results of operations.
The Company determined that no change in business conditions occurred which would have a material adverse effect on the valuation of goodwill. Provision for
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized. This guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination.
We had
no
uncertain tax positions at either December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022. We report interest and penalties as a component of provision for income taxes. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recognized
no
interest and
no
penalties related to income taxes. Stock-based Compensation The Company uses the fair value-based method for stock-based compensation. Options issued are designated as either an incentive stock option or a non-statutory stock option.
No
option may be granted with a term of more than
10
years from the date of grant. Option awards may depend on achievement of certain performance measures determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board. Shares issued upon option exercise are newly issued common shares. All awards to employees and non-employees are recorded at fair value on the date of the grant and expensed over the period of vesting. The Company uses a Monte Carlo method to estimate the fair value of each stock option at the date of grant. Any consideration paid by the option holders to purchase shares is credited to common stock. Compensation Expense Compensation expense for the portion of equity awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered is recognized as the requisite service is rendered. The compensation expense for that portion of awards has been based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated for recognition purposes under applicable guidance. For options that vest based on the Company’s common stock achieving and maintaining defined market prices, the Company values the awards with a Monte Carlo method that utilizes various probability factors and other criterion in establishing fair value of the grant. The related compensation expense is recognized over the service period. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash balances at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $ 250,000 . Deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the $ 250,000
limit.
9 Accounts Receivable Receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers where the right to consideration is unconditional and amounts unbilled. Both billed and unbilled amounts are non-interest bearing, unsecured, and recognized at an estimated realizable value that includes costs and fees, and are generally expected to be billed and received within a single year. We evaluate our receivables on a quarterly basis and determine whether an allowance is appropriate based on specific collection issues. No allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at either December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding and restricted stock grants that vested or are likely to vest during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of basic common shares outstanding, adjusted to reflect potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method.
Treasury Stock The Company periodically purchases its own common stock that is traded on public markets as part of announced stock repurchase programs. The repurchased common stock is classified as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheets and held at cost. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company did not hold any treasury stock. Preferred Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors up to an aggregate of
5,000,000
shares of preferred stock.
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company has
no t issued any preferred stock. Interest Rate Swap The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with its variable debt.
The Company's objective in using these interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements and reduce volatility of interest expense. The gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt. Offsetting changes in fair value of both the interest rate swaps and the hedged portion of the underlying debt are recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company does not hold or issue any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Risks & Uncertainties Management evaluates the impact of global markets and economic factors on our industry and the potential for adverse effects on the Company's consolidated financial position and its operations. As of the date of these consolidated financial statements, there was no indication of any global or economic impacts to our industry. 3.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2020 and January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” and ASU No. 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope,” respectively (collectively, “Topic 848”). Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In December 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-06 "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848" which defers the end date for electing the relief provided in Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company adopted the optional expedients and exceptions provided in Topic 848. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 10 4. Business Combinations Acquisition of Grove Resource Solutions, LLC On December 8, 2022, the Company acquired
100 % of the equity interests of Grove Resource Solution, LLC ("GRSi") for a net preliminary purchase price of $ 185.1  million, inclusive of the preliminary working capital adjustment. The acquisition was financed through a combination of:
• borrowings of $ 178.1  million under the Company’s amended and restated credit facility; and • common stock issued of approximately
0.5  million shares, which were valued at $ 7.0  million in the aggregate, based on the 20-day volume-adjusted average price of its common stock. The acquisition of GRSi was consistent with the Company’s growth strategy, as it provided contract diversification, addition of key capabilities and increased presence in the military health market. The estimated goodwill derived from this transaction is primarily due to these attributes. We have used the acquisition method of accounting for this transaction, whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
The preliminary purchase price for GRSi was $ 188.5  million adjusted to reflect acquired cash, assumed liabilities and preliminary net working capital adjustments.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties.
Subject to certain limitations and conditions, the seller and the equity holders of the seller do not have indemnity obligation for damages resulting from breaches or inaccuracies of the representations, warranties, and covenants of the seller, GRSI and the equity holders as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also provided for the establishment of an escrow account in order to satisfy (i) any downward adjustment of the purchase price base on GRSI's net working capital at the closing and (ii) certain specified indemnification obligations of the seller and equity holders that may arise following the closing. The escrow account is funded by an aggregate amount of approximately $ 4.3  million and the stock consideration. A representations and warranties insurance policy has been purchased by the Company in connection with the Purchase Agreement, under which the Company may seek recourse for breaches of the representations and warranties of the seller, GRSI and the equity holders. The representations and warranties insurance policy is subject to certain customary exclusions and a deductible. In accordance with ASU 2017-01, the Company evaluated the transaction as an acquisition of a business.
We are still assessing the acquisition price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of GRSi at the acquisition date. We are awaiting the fair values of the intangibles assets from the third party valuation firm. The preliminary purchase price and its allocation are shown below and are subject to change once the valuation is complete.
Based on the unaudited financial statements of GRSi on December 8, 2022, we accounted for the total acquisition consideration and allocation of fair value to the related assets and liabilities on a preliminary basis as follows (in thousands): Preliminary purchase price for GRSi $ 188,458   Purchase price allocation: Cash 747   Accounts receivable   25,468   Other current assets 1,354   Accounts payable and accrued expenses ( 2,449 ) Payroll liabilities ( 7,827 ) Other current liabilities ( 325 ) Equipment and improvements, net   463   Other long-term assets and liabilities   ( 611 ) Intangible assets 98,004   Total identifiable net assets acquired 114,824   Goodwill 73,634   11 All operating units are aggregated into a single reportable segment. The acquisition of GRSi did not create an additional reportable segment as all operations report to a single Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), serve a similar customer base, and provide similar services within a common regulatory environment. The goodwill represents intellectual capital and the acquired workforce, of which both do not qualify as a separate intangible asset. The tax deductible goodwill is in the process of being calculated.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 following the completion of the acquisition, GRSi contributed approximately $ 6.9
million of revenue and $ 0.3
million of income from operations.
The following table presents certain results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as though the acquisition of GRSi had occurred on October 1, 2021. The unaudited pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results if the acquisition had taken place on that date. The pro forma information was prepared by combining our reported historical results with the historical results of GRSi for the pre-acquisition periods.
In addition, the reported historical amounts were adjusted for the following items, net of associated tax effects: • The impact of recording GRSi's intangible asset amortization. • The impact of interest expense for the new credit facility. • The removal of legacy GRSi director's fees. • The removal of transaction costs for the acquisition incurred by GRSi.

(a) Represents the principal amounts payable on our term loan, which is secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company. The principal of the term loan is payable in quarterly installments with the remaining balance due on December 8, 2027.
The Credit Agreement requires compliance with a number of financial covenants and contains restrictions on our ability to engage in certain transactions. Among other matters, we must comply with limitations on the following: granting liens; incurring other indebtedness; maintenance of assets; investments in other entities and extensions of credit; mergers and consolidations; and changes in nature of business. The loan agreement also requires us to comply with certain quarterly financial covenants including: (i) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least
1.25
to 1.00, and (ii) a total leverage ratio not exceeding the ratio of
4.50 :1.0 to
2.00 :1.0 through maturity. The total leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the Company's total interest-bearing debt by net income adjusted to exclude (i) interest and
17 other expenses, (ii) provision for or benefit from income taxes, if any, (iii) depreciation and amortization, and (iv) non-cash charges, losses or expenses, including stock-based compensation, and (v) non-recurring charges, losses or expenses to include transaction and non-cash equity expense. We are in compliance with all loan covenants and restrictions.
We are required to pay quarterly amortization payments, which commenced in December 2022. The annual amortization amounts are $ 14.25
million each for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, $ 19.0
million each for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, and $ 23.75
million for fiscal year 2027, with the remaining unpaid loan balance due at maturity in December 2027. The quarterly payments are equal installments. The Company made a mandatory prepayment of $ 3.6
million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 bringing the outstanding principal balance on the secured term loan to $186.4 million. We have satisfied mandatory principal amortization until March 31, 2023. In addition to quarterly payments of the outstanding indebtedness, the loan agreement also requires annual payments of a percentage of excess cash flow, as defined in the loan agreement. The loan agreement states that an excess cash flow recapture payment must be made equal to (a)
75 % of the excess cash flow for the immediately preceding fiscal year in which the total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to
2.50 :1.0; (b)
50 % of the excess cash flow for the immediately preceding fiscal year in which the total leverage ratio is less than
2.50 :1.0 but greater than or equal to
1.5 :1.0; or (c)
0 % of the excess cash flow for the immediately preceding fiscal year in which the total leverage ratio is less than
1.5 :1.0. In addition, the Company must make additional mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding based on proceeds received from asset sales and sales of certain indebtedness. For additional information regarding the schedule of future payment obligations, please refer to
Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies . On September 30, 2019, we executed a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with First National Bank ("FNB") as counter-party. The notional amount in the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap as of December 31, 2022 is $ 16.2  million and matures in 2024. The remaining outstanding balance of our term loan is subject to interest rate fluctuations. On the notional amount, the Company pays a base fixed rate of
1.61 %, plus applicable credit spread. As a result, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, interest expense has been decreased by approximately $ 0.1  million. (b) The secured revolving line of credit has a ceiling of up to $ 70.0
million; as of December 31, 2022 we had unused borrowing capacity
of $ 31.2  million, wh ich is net of outstanding letters of credit. Borrowing on the line of credit is secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Company accessed funds from the revolving credit facility during the quarter, but had an outstanding balance at December 31, 2022 of $ 16.9
million.
The Company's total borrowing availability, based on eligible accounts receivable at December 31, 2022, was $ 70.0
million. As part of the revolving credit facility, the lenders agreed to a sublimit of $ 5  million for letters of credit for the account of the Company, subject to applicable procedures. The revolving line of credit has a maturity date of December 8, 2027 and is subject to loan covenants as described above. The Company is fully compliant with those covenants.

ITEM 2:  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements   You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, and in other reports we have subsequently filed with the SEC. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances or that are not statements of historical fact (including without limitation statements to the effect that the Company or its management “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “intends” and similar expressions) should be considered forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or DLH’s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this report include, among others, statements regarding benefits of the acquisition, estimates of future revenues, operating income, earnings, earnings per share, backlog, and cash flows. These statements reflect our belief and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Our actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements made in this report due to a variety of factors, including: the continuation of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), including the measures to reduce its spread, and its impact on the economy and demand for our services, which are uncertain, cannot be predicted, and may precipitate or exacerbate other risks and uncertainties; the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of
GRSi or any future acquisition (including anticipated future financial operating performance and results); the diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from our recent acquisition; the inability to retain employees and customers; contract awards in connection with re-competes for present business and/or competition for new business; our ability to manage our increased debt obligations; compliance with bank financial and other covenants; changes in client budgetary priorities; government contract procurement (such as bid and award protests, small business set asides, loss of work due to organizational conflicts of interest, etc.) and termination risks; the ability to successfully integrate the operations of GRSi or any future acquisitions; the impact of inflation and higher interest rates; and other risks described in our SEC filings. For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see “Risk Factors” in the Company’s periodic reports filed with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, as well as interim quarterly filings thereafter. The forward-looking statements contained herein are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry and business.

21 Business and Markets Overview DLH enhances public health and national security readiness missions through science, technology, cyber, and engineering solutions and services. We are primarily focused on improving and better deploying large-scale federal health and human service initiatives. The Company derives 99% of its revenue from agencies of the Federal government, providing services to several agencies including the Department of Veteran Affairs ("VA"), Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), Department of Defense ("DoD"), and Department of Homeland Security, ("DHS"). The following table summarizes revenue by customer for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as follows (in thousands and percent): 2022 2021 Revenue Percent of total revenue Revenue Percent of total revenue Department of Veterans Affairs $ 33,708  46.4  % $ 28,193  18.5  % Department of Health and Human Services 27,305  37.5  % 23,126  15.1  % Department of Defense 10,263  14.1  % 8,495  5.6  % Department of Homeland Security 167  0.2  % 91,328  59.8  % Other customers with less than 10% share of total revenue 1,295  1.8  % 1,659  1.0  % Total revenue $ 72,738   100.0   % $ 152,801   100.0   % We provide solutions to three market focus areas: Defense and Veteran Health Solutions, Human Solutions and Services, and Public Health and Life Sciences. We deliver domain-specific expertise, industry best-practices and innovations to customers across these markets leveraging seven core competencies: secure data analytics, clinical trials and laboratory services, case management, performance evaluation, system modernization, operational logistics and readiness, and strategic digital communications. The Company manages its operations from its principal executive office in Atlanta, Georgia, and we have a complementary headquarters office in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Company employs over 3,200 skilled employees workin g
throughout the United States and one location overseas.
Acquisitions On December 8, 2022, we acquired Grove Resource Solutions, LLC. ("GRSi") to increase future organic growth, diversify our customer base, and to expand into adjacent markets. GRSi provides research and development, systems engineering and integration, and digital transformations solutions to federal agencies, notably the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corp. For further information, refer to
Note 4
of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Major Contracts We operate primarily through prime contracts awarded by the government through competitive bidding processes. We have a diverse mix of contract vehicles with various agencies of the United State government, which supports our overall corporate growth strategy. Our Federal contract schedules are renewed on a recurring basis for multi-year periods.
The revenue attributable to the VA was derived from 16 separate contracts covering the Company's performance of pharmacy and logistics services in support of the VA's Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy ("CMOP") program.
• Nine contracts for pharmacy services, which represent revenues of approximately $19.2 million and $15.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are currently operating under a bridge contract through October 2023.
• Seven contracts for logistics services, which represent approximately $14.5 million and $12.6 million of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are currently operating under a bridge contract through November 2023.
The VA has issued a request for proposal for healthcare logistics and pharmacy services for each CMOP location.
The procurement was set-aside for a service-disabled veteran owned small business ("SDVOSB") to be solicited as the prime contractor.
DLH maintains relationships with SDVOSB partners. Should the new contracts for performance of these services be awarded to a partner of DLH, the Company expects to continue to perform a significant amount of the contract’s volume of business as a subcontractor.
Should the VA conclude that an award to an SDVOSB prime contractor is not in the best interest
22 of the government, they may reissue a solicitation in an unrestricted competition. DLH believes that its service excellence over many years on the program would provide an advantage in an unrestricted competition. The Company's contract with HHS in support of its Head Start program generated $9.1 million and $6.8 million of its revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This contract has a period of performance through April 2025. We remain dependent upon the continuation of our relationships with the VA and HHS. Our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if we were unable to continue our relationship with either of these customers, if we were to lose any of our material current contracts, or if the amount of services we provide to them was to be materially reduced.
Backlog At December 31, 2022, our backlog was approximately $942.7 million, of which $164.0 million was funded backlog. At September 30, 2022, our backlog was approximately $482.5 million, of which $98.9 million was funded backlog. We define backlog as our estimate of remaining future revenue from existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to such contracts and including executed task orders issued under Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery ("IDIQ") contracts or if the contract is a single award IDIQ contract. We define funded backlog as the portion of backlog for which funding is appropriated and allocated to the contract by the customer and authorized for payment by the customer, once specified work is completed. Funded backlog does not include the full contract value as Congress often appropriates funding for contracts on a yearly or quarterly basis. Circumstances and events may cause changes in the amount of our backlog and funded backlog, including the execution of new contracts, extension of existing contracts, non-renewal or completion of current contracts, early termination, and adjustments to estimates. Changes in funded backlog may be affected by the funding cycles of the government. While no assurances can be given that existing contracts will result in earned revenue in any future period, or at all, our major customers have historically exercised their contractual renewal options. Backlog value is quantified from management's judgment and assumptions about the volume of services based on past volume trends and current planning developed with customers.
Forward-Looking Business Trends Our mission is to expand our position as a trusted provider of technology-enabled healthcare and public health services, medical logistics, and readiness enhancement services to active duty personnel, veterans, and civilian populations and communities. Our primary focus within the defense agency markets include military service members' and veterans' requirements for telehealth services, behavioral healthcare, medication therapy management, process management, clinical systems support, and healthcare delivery. Our primary focus within the civilian agency markets includes healthcare and social programs delivery and readiness. These include compliance monitoring on large scale programs, technology-enabled program management, consulting, and digital communications solutions ensuring that education, health, and social standards are being achieved within underserved and at-risk populations. We believe these business development priorities will position the Company to expand within top national priority programs and funded areas. 23 COVID-19 impact
We are exposed to and impacted by macroeconomic factors and U.S. government policies. Current general economic conditions, while improving, may continue to experience volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in both market size contractions due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement during the height of the pandemic.
We are monitoring the evolving situation related to COVID-19, and we continue to work with our stakeholders to assess further possible implications to our business . We intend to continue with employee safety measures to ensure that we can continue our operations and take other actions where appropriate to mitigate other adverse consequences.
Although we cannot currently predict the overall impact of COVID-19, the longer the duration of the event, the more likely it is that it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, billable expenses, and/or cash flows.
However, we have seen continued demand for the services we provide under our current contract portfolio as the services we provide are largely deemed essential. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact to revenues and operating income.
Further, due to our ability to continue to perform on our contract portfolio and generate cash flow, we do not presently expect nor have experienced liquidity constraints related to COVID-19. We are presently in compliance with all covenants in our secured term loan and have access to a secured revolving line of credit to meet any short-term cash needs that cannot be funded by operations. As such, mandatory demands on our cash flow remain low. Further, we have not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of our assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal budget outlook for 2023 On December 29, 2022, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 to fund the Federal government for the remainder of the Federal government's 2023 fiscal year. Our customers' missions have received broad support from the legislative and executive branches of the Federal government. As such, we do not anticipate or expect any significant changes to our operations. In addition, budget deficits and the growing U.S. national debt increase pressure on the U.S. government to reduce federal spending across all federal agencies. Presently, there is significant uncertainty about the size and timing of those reductions and the actions that Congress would pursue in order to resolve them.
Current and future budget restrictions and other efforts to reduce U.S. government spending could cause clients to reduce or delay funding for orders for services or invest appropriated funds on a less consistent or rapid basis or not at all, particularly in light of current uncertainty around Congressional efforts to craft a long-term agreement on the U.S. government's ability to incur indebtedness in excess of its current limits. Industry consolidation among federal government contractors There has been active consolidation and a strong increase in merger and acquisition activity among federal government contractors over the past few years that we expect to continue, fueled by public companies leveraging strong balance sheets. Companies often look to acquisitions that augment core capabilities, contracts, customers, market differentiators, stability, cost synergies, and higher margin and revenue streams. Potential impact of Federal Contractual set-aside Laws and Regulations: The Federal government has an overall goal of 23% of prime contracts flowing through small businesses. As previously reported, various agencies within the federal government have policies that support small business goals, including the adoption of the “Rule of Two” by the VA, which provides that the agency shall award contracts by restricting competition for the contract to service-disabled or other veteran owned businesses. To restrict competition pursuant to this rule, the contracting officer must reasonably expect that at least two of these businesses, which are capable of delivering the services, will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States. When two qualifying small businesses cannot be identified, the VA may proceed to award contracts following a full and open bid process. The Company believes that its past performance in this market and track record of success provide a competitive advantage. However, the effect of set-aside provisions may limit our ability to compete for prime contractor positions on programs that we recompete or that we have targeted for growth. In these cases, the Company may elect to join a team with an eligible contractor as prime in support of such small businesses for specific pursuits that align with our core markets and corporate growth strategy. 24 Results of Operations
For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 as Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021   The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, consolidated statements of operations data expressed in dollars in thousands except for per share amounts, and as a percentage of revenue as follows (in thousands and percent):

• During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we acquired GRSi. From the date of this acquisition, we have received the benefit of additional revenue, as well as incurred additional operating costs.
In addition, we amended and restated our credit facility to fund the acquisition of GRSi and the cost of servicing this debt has resulted in an increase in our interest expense. • Our results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 included revenues of approximately $91.1 million derived from the two task orders awarded under a FEMA contact to support the State of Alaska in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These task orders were completed during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 and there was no comparable revenue contribution from this work during the 2022 period. Due to these developments, in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, we have included a discussion of our adjusted financial performance to present our financial performance for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 without the impacts of the GRSi acquisition and the FEMA task orders.
Revenue   Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $72.7 million, a decrease of $80.1 million or 52.4% over the prior year period. The decrease in revenue is primarily due to the $91.1 million revenue contribution in the quarter ended December 31, 2021 from two task orders awarded under a FEMA contract to support Alaska with its response to COVID-19 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These tasks orders were completed during the quarter ended March 31, 2022.
25 Cost of Operations Contract costs primarily include the costs associated with providing services to our customers. These costs are generally comprised of direct labor and associated fringe benefit costs, subcontract cost, other direct costs, and the related management and infrastructure costs. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, contract costs decreased by approximately $75.4 million, principally due to the direct costs incurred during the prior year period associated with the two task orders awarded under a FEMA contract to support Alaska with its response to COVID-19 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. General and administrative costs are for those employees not directly providing services to our customers, to include but not limited to executive management, bid and proposal, accounting, and human resources. These costs increased as compared to the prior fiscal year period by $0.5 million, primarily due to the inclusion of GRSi. Corporate development costs in 2022 were due to the GRSi acquisition and include due diligence costs, such as legal and accounting fees. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, depreciation and amortization costs were approximately $0.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively, as compared to approximately $0.3 million and $1.6 million for the prior fiscal year period. The increase in amortization of $0.6 million was principally due to the acquired definite-lived intangible assets of GRSi. Interest Expense   Interest expense includes items such as interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs on debt obligations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, interest expense was approximately $1.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the borrowing required to finance the GRSi acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, DLH recorded a $0.5 million and $2.7 million provision for tax expense, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 26% and 26%, respectively. Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and EBITDA Margin on Revenue as supplemental non-GAAP measures of performance. We define EBITDA as net income excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) provision for or benefit from income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization. EBITDA Margin on Revenue is EBITDA for the measurement period divided by revenue for the same period. The Company is presenting additional non-GAAP measures to describe the impact on its financial performance from the acquisition of GRSi for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the two short-term FEMA task orders for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The measures presented are Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Adjusted Revenue. In calculating these measures, we have removed the contribution from GRSi, including the corporate and incremental borrowing costs associated with completing the acquisition, as well as the FEMA task orders. These resulting measures present the quarterly financial performance compared to results delivered in the prior year period. Definitions of these additional non-GAAP measures are set forth below. We prepare these additional non-GAAP measures to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual or extraordinary nature. These non-GAAP measures of performance are used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its review of operating results for the periods presented. Management and the Company's Board utilize these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the use of the Company's resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the Company's historical performance.
These supplemental performance measurements may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies in our industry. Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin on Revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Adjusted Revenue are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and when analyzing our performance investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to the nearest GAAP financial measures and (ii) use the aforementioned non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as an alternative to, revenue,
26 operating income, net income or diluted EPS, as measures of operating results, each as defined under GAAP. We have defined these non-GAAP measures as follows: “ Adjusted Revenue” represents revenue less the contribution to revenue from the short term FEMA task orders and the
contribution to revenue from GRSi for the period following the closing of the acquisition.
“Adjusted Operating Income” represents operating income less
the contribution from GRSi, including the corporate and incremental borrowing costs associated with completing the acquisition, as well as the FEMA task orders. “Adjusted Net Income” represents net income less
the contribution from GRSi, including the corporate and incremental borrowing costs associated with completing the acquisition, as well as the FEMA task orders. “Adjusted Diluted EPS” represents diluted EPS calculated using Adjusted Net Income as opposed to net income.
“Adjusted EBITDA” represents net income before income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization and
the contribution from GRSi, including the corporate and incremental borrowing costs associated with completing the acquisition, as well as the FEMA task orders.
“Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Adjusted Revenue” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue.
Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin on Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Adjusted Revenue reported for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 compared to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as follows (in thousands except for per share amounts): 27 2022 2021 Change Adjusted Revenue Revenue $ 72,738 $ 152,801 $ (80,063) Less: acquired revenue (a) 6,878 — 6,878 Less: FEMA task orders to support Alaska (b) — 91,125 (91,125) Adjusted Revenue $ 65,860 $ 61,676 $ 4,184 Adjusted Operating Income Operating Income $ 3,921 $ 11,219 $ (7,298) Corporate development costs (c) 1,735  — 1,735 Less: acquired operating income (a) 346 — 346 Less: FEMA task orders to support Alaska (b) — 6,346 (6,346) Adjusted Operating Income $ 5,310 $ 4,873 $ 437 Adjusted Net Income Net income $ 1,547 $ 7,804 $ (6,257) Corporate development costs (c) 1,735  — 1,735 Incremental financing costs (d) 1,352 — 1,352 Less: acquired operating income (a) 346 — 346 Less: FEMA task orders to support Alaska (b) — 6,346 (6,346) Adjustments for tax effect (e) (713) 1,650 (2,363) Adjusted Net Income $ 3,575 $ 3,108 $ 467 Adjusted Diluted earnings per share Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 14,276  14,295  (19) Diluted earnings per share $ 0.11 $ 0.55 $ (0.44) Adjusted net income per diluted share $ 0.25 $ 0.22 $ 0.03 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin on Revenue & Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Adjusted Revenue Net Income $ 1,547 $ 7,804 $ (6,257) Depreciation and amortization 2,402  1,985  417 Interest expense 1,830  672  1,158 Provision for income taxes 544  2,743  (2,199) EBITDA $ 6,323 $ 13,204 $ (6,881) Corporate development costs (c) 1,735  $ — 1,735 Less: acquired EBITDA (f) $ 858 $ — 858 Less: FEMA task order to support Alaska (b) $ — $ 6,346 (6,346) Adjusted EBITDA $ 7,200 $ 6,858 $ 342 Net income margin on Revenue 2.1% 5.1% EBITDA Margin on Revenue 8.7% 8.6% Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Adjusted Revenue 10.9% 11.1% (a): Represents the operating results for GRSi following the closing of the acquisition on December 8, 2022 to December 31, 2022 Operating income for GRSi is derived by subtracting from the revenue attributable to GRSi following the closing of the acquisition during the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $6.9 million the following amounts associated with GRSi: contract costs of $5.4 million, general & administrative costs of $0.6 million, amortization expense of $0.5 million. 28 (b): Represents the operating results for the FEMA task orders during the during three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating income for the FEMA task orders is derived by subtracting from the revenue attributable to such task orders during the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $91.1 million the following amounts associated with such task orders: contract costs of $84.2 million and general & administrative costs of $0.6 million.
(c): Represents corporate development costs we incurred to complete the GRSi transaction. These costs primarily include legal counsel, financial due diligence, customer market analysis and representation and warranty insurance premiums. (d): Incremental interest expense incurred following the completion of the GRSi acquisition on December 8, 2022. (e): Reflects the tax effect of adjustments at the effective tax rate of 26%, which approximates our blended federal and state tax rates. (f): Reflects operating income of GRSi following the closing of the acquisition of $0.4 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $0.5 million. Liquidity and capital management As of December 31, 2022, the Company's immediate sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, accounts receivable, and access to its secured revolving line of credit facility. This credit facility provides us with access of up to $70.0 million, subject to certain conditions including eligible accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, we have $31.2 million of available borrowing capacity on the revolving line of credit and have an outstanding balance of $16.9 million.
The Company's present operating liabilities are largely predictable and consist of vendor and payroll related obligations. Our current investment and financing obligations are adequately covered by cash generated from profitable operations and planned operating cash flow should be sufficient to support the Company's operations for twelve months from issuance of these consolidated financial statements. A summary of the change in cash is presented below for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as follows (in thousands): 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 7,973  $ (16,155) Net cash used in investing activities (180,342) —  Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 173,505  (3,675) Net change in cash $ 1,136   $ (19,830) The cash used in investing activity was primarily due to the acquisition of GRSi and the purchase of capital assets purchased during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Cash provided by financing activities was $173.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and were deployed to finance the GRSi acquisition. We intend to continue using cash to make debt prepayments in future quarters subject to available cash. Sources of cash As of December 31, 2022, our immediate sources of liquidity include cash of approximately $1.4 million, accounts receivable, and access to our secured revolving line of credit facility. This credit facility provides us with access of up to $70.0 million, subject to certain conditions including eligible accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, we had unused borrowing capacity of
$31.2 million,
which is net of outstanding letters of credit. The Company's present operating liabilities are largely predictable and consist of vendor and payroll related obligations. We believe that our current investment and financing obligations are adequately covered by cash generated from profitable operations and that planned operating cash flow should be sufficient to support our operations for twelve months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 29 Credit Facilities A summary of our credit facilities for the period ended December 31, 2022 is as follows (in millions):
Arrangement Loan Balance Interest* Maturity Date Secured term loan (a) due December 8, 2027 $ 186.4  SOFR* + 4.2% December 8, 2027 Secured revolving line of credit (b) due December 8, 2027 $ 16.9  SOFR* + 4.2% December 8, 2027 *SOFR as of December 31, 2022 was 4.23%.
(a)
Represents the principal amounts payable on our term loan, which is secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company. The principal of the term loan is payable in quarterly installments with the remaining balance due on December 8, 2027.
On September 30, 2019, we executed a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with First National Bank ("FNB") as counter-party. The notional amount in the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap as of December 31, 2022 is $16.2 million and matures in 2024. The remaining outstanding balance of our term loan is subject to interest rate fluctuations. (b) The secured revolving line of credit has a ceiling of up to $70.0 million and a maturity date of December 8, 2027. The Company has accessed funds from the revolving credit facility during the quarter and has a balance outstanding at December 31, 2022 of $16.9 million.
The secured term loan and secured revolving line of credit are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company. The provisions of our credit facilities are fully described in

Significant estimates include valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and measurement of loss development on workers' compensation claims. In addition, the Company estimates overhead charges and allocates such charges throughout the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, you should review the discussion under the caption
Significant Accounting Policies in Note 2
of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 30 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue over time when there is a continuous transfer of control to our customer. For our U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the U.S. government to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit, and take control of any work in process. When control is transferred over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For services contracts, we satisfy our performance obligations as services are rendered. We use cost-based input and time-based output methods to measure progress.
For time and materials contracts, revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus materials and other reimbursable costs incurred. Revenue for cost reimbursable contracts is recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred, including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned. For firm fixed price contracts, the consideration received for our performance is set at a predetermined price. Revenue for our firm fixed price contracts is recognized over time using a straight-line measure of progress or using the percentage-of-completion method whereby progress toward completion is based on a comparison of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs to be incurred over the contract term. Contract costs are expensed as incurred. Estimated losses are recognized when identified.
Refer to
Note 5
of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Long-lived Assets
Our long-lived assets include equipment and improvements, right-of-use assets, intangible assets, and goodwill. The Company continues to review its long-lived assets for possible impairment or loss of value at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value.
Equipment and improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful asset lives (3 to 7 years) and the shorter of the initial lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Costs incurred to place the asset in service are capitalized and costs incurred after implementation are expensed. Amortization expense is recorded when the software is placed in service on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. Right-of-use assets are measured at the present value of future minimum lease payments, including all probable renewals, plus lease payments made to the lessor before or at lease commencement and indirect costs, less incentives received. Our right-of-use assets include long-term leases for facilities and equipment and are amortized over their respective lease terms. Intangible assets are originally recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over their assessed useful lives. The assessed useful lives of the assets are 10 years. Goodwill   The Company continues to review its goodwill for possible impairment or loss of value at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Based on the results of the work performed, the Company has concluded that no impairment loss was warranted, as no change in business conditions occurred which would have a material adverse effect on the valuation of goodwill.
Our assessment incorporated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which did not have a meaningful impact on our financial results. Notwithstanding this evaluation, factors including non-renewal of a major contract or other substantial changes in business conditions could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of goodwill in future periods and the resulting charge could be material to future periods’ results of operations.
Provision for Income Taxes   The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized. This guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has fully utilized its net operating loss carryforwards. 31 Stock-based Equity Compensation The Company uses the fair value-based method for stock-based compensation. Options issued are designated as either an incentive stock or a non-statutory stock option. No option may be granted with a term of more than 10 years from the date of grant. Option awards may depend on achievement of certain performance measures determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board. Shares issued upon option exercise are newly issued common shares. All awards to employees and non-employees are recorded at fair value on the date of the grant and expensed over the period of vesting. The Company uses a Monte Carlo method to estimate the fair value of each stock option at the date of grant. Any consideration paid by the option holders to purchase shares is credited to capital stock.
ITEM 3:         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Except as described elsewhere in this report, the Company has not engaged in trading practices in securities or other financial instruments and therefore does not have any material exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk or other similar risks, which might otherwise result from such practices. The Company has limited foreign operations and therefore is not materially subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or other market rates or prices from market sensitive instruments. On September 30, 2019, we executed a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with FNB as counter-party. The notional amount in the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap is $16.2 million for the current quarter and the remaining outstanding balance of our secured term loan is subject to interest rate fluctuations. Following the close of the quarter, we entered into an additional floating-to-fixed interest rate swap. The notional amount of the interest rate swap increased to $112.2 million with the remaining balance of debt subject to floating interest rates. The fixed rate is 4.10% plus applicable credit spread and the swap matures in 2026.
We have determined that a 1.0% increase to SOFR would impact our interest expense by approximately $0.9 million per year. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate on the floating interest rate debt was 8.43%. ITEM 4:         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our CEO and President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and President and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   Our management, including our CEO and President and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. Our management, however, believes our disclosure controls and procedures are in fact effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting With the exception of the matter described below there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal controls that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In December 2022, we acquired Grove Resource Solutions, LLC and are in the process of integrating this business into our existing control environment. 32 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1:         LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As a commercial enterprise and employer, the Company is subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business. These matters can include professional liability, workers’ compensation, tax, payroll and employee-related matters, other commercial disputes arising in the course of its business, and inquiries and investigations by governmental agencies regarding our employment practices or other matters. The Company is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation that it believes is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.   ITEM 1A:      RISK FACTORS   Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 and in our other reports filed with the SEC concerning the risks associated with our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors, among others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. The risks we have identified in our reports are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
See Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2022 . Other than as described below, we believe that there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2022 . Risks related to our acquisition of GRSi
Our indebtedness following the completion of the GRSi acquisition is significant and could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.
In connection with the GRSi acquisition, we incurred significant additional indebtedness. Our new indebtedness contains financial or other covenants that limit our operational flexibility. In addition, the increased indebtedness of the Company following the GRSi acquisition could adversely affect us in a number of other ways, including: •
causing us to be less able to take advantage of business opportunities, such as other acquisition opportunities, and to         react to changes in market or industry conditions; •
increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments; •
affecting our ability to pay or refinance debts as they become due during adverse economic, financial market, and industry conditions; •
requiring us to use a larger portion of cash flow for debt service, reducing funds available for other purposes; •
decreasing our profitability and/or cash flow; •
causing us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage; and •
limiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. We may experience difficulties in integrating our operations with those of GRSi and realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions.
A lthough we currently anticipate that the GRSi acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in fiscal 2024,
this expectation is based on assumptions about our business and preliminary estimates, which may change materially. The benefits of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of DLH and GRSi and realize the anticipated benefits, including business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our businesses. We may not achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or may never realize these benefits and the value of our common stock may be harmed. The acquisition involves the integration of GRSi’s business with our existing business, which is expected to be a costly and time-consuming process. The integration may result in material challenges, including, without limitation: 33 •
Our management might have its attention diverted from ongoing business concerns while trying to integrate these operations, and we could experience performance shortfalls as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the integration efforts. •
The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions, and could harm our financial performance. •
We could encounter unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems that could harm our financial performance. •
If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate our operations with those of GRSi, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies, and other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In connection with the acquisition, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges that could negatively affect our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition, and results of operations.
Although we have conducted extensive due diligence on GRSi in connection with the acquisition, we cannot assure that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through customary due diligence, or that factors outside of our control will not later arise. We have also purchased representations and warranties insurance in connection with the acquisition, but there is no assurance that those policies will cover any losses we might experience from breaches of the sellers’ representations and warranties or otherwise arising from the acquisition. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Further, as a result of the acquisition, purchase accounting, and the proposed operation of the combined company after closing, we may be required to take write-offs or write-downs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could negatively affect business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations after closing of the acquisition.
