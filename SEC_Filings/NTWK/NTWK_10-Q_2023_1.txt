BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The
Company designs, develops, markets, and exports proprietary software products to customers in the automobile financing and leasing, banking,
and financial services industries worldwide. The Company also provides system integration, consulting, and IT products and services in
exchange for fees from customers.
The
consolidated condensed interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules
and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The
year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These
statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for
fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended June 30, 2022. The Company follows the same accounting policies in preparation of interim reports. Results of operations for the
interim periods are not indicative of annual results.
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company as follows:

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. The areas requiring significant estimates are provision for doubtful accounts, provision for taxation, useful life
of depreciable assets, useful life of intangible assets, contingencies, assumptions used to determine the net present value of operating
lease liabilities, and estimated contract costs. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Cash
includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained within the United States as well as in foreign countries. Certain financial
instruments, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist of cash and restricted cash. The Company maintains balances
at financial institutions which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits for the banks located
in the United States. Balances at financial institutions within certain foreign countries are not covered by insurance except balances
maintained in China are insured for RMB
500,000
($ 72,464 ) in each bank and in the UK for GBP
85,000
($ 102,410 ) in each bank. The Company
maintains three bank accounts in China and nine bank accounts in the UK. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the Company had
uninsured deposits related to cash deposits in accounts maintained within foreign entities of approximately $ 18,568,700
and $ 22,758,963 ,
respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
The
Company’s operations are carried out globally. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations
may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments of each country and by the general state of the country’s economy.
The Company’s operations in each foreign country are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated
with companies in economically developed nations. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal
environments and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies
with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of
taxation, among other things.
Fair Value
of Financial Instruments
The
Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820-10,
“Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures.”
ASC 820-10 defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value
measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively
short maturities. The carrying amounts of the convertible note receivable and the long-term debt approximate their fair values based
on current interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics.
The three levels
of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
Level
1:
Valuations
consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and has the highest priority.
Level
2:
Valuations
rely on quoted prices in markets that are not active or observable inputs over the full term of the asset or liability.
Level
3:
Valuations
are based on prices or third party or internal valuation models that require inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement
and are less observable and thus have the lowest priority.

Management
analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480,
“Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity”
and ASC 815,
“Derivatives and Hedging.”
Derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value
at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value
of derivatives. The effects of interactions between embedded derivatives are calculated and accounted for in arriving at the overall
fair value of the financial instruments. In addition, the fair values of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants and option
derivatives are valued using the Black-Scholes model.
Recent
Accounting Standards :
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if the acquirer
had originated the contracts. ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within
those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.
All other newly
issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The
Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
●
Identification
of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
●
Identification
of the performance obligations in the contract;
●
Determination
of the transaction price;
●
Allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
●
Recognition
of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
The
Company records the amount of revenue and related costs by considering whether the entity is a principal (gross presentation) or an agent
(net presentation) by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer. Revenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other
taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.
The Company has
two primary revenue streams: core revenue and non-core revenue.
Core
Revenue
The
Company generates its core revenue from the following sources: (1) software licenses, (2) services, which include implementation and
consulting services, and (3) subscription and support, which includes post contract support, of its enterprise software solutions for
the lease and finance industry. The Company offers its software using the same underlying technology via two models: a traditional on-premises
licensing model and a subscription model. The on-premises model involves the sale or license of software on a perpetual basis to customers
who take possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware. Under the subscription delivery model,
the Company provides access to its software on a hosted basis as a service and customers generally do not have the contractual right
to take possession of the software.
Non-Core Revenue
The
Company generates its non-core revenue by providing business process outsourcing (“BPO”), other IT services and internet
services.
Performance
Obligations
A
performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under
Topic 606. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance
obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. The Company identifies and tracks the performance
obligations at contract inception so that the Company can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.
The
Company’s contracts which contain multiple performance obligations generally consist of the initial purchase of subscription or
licenses and a professional services engagement. License purchases generally have multiple performance obligations as customers purchase
post contract support and services in addition to the licenses. The Company’s single performance obligation arrangements are typically
post contract support renewals, subscription renewals and services engagements.
For
contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling price (“SSP”)
for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance
obligation using its best estimate for the SSP.
Software Licenses
Transfer
of control for software is considered to have occurred upon delivery of the product to the customer. The Company’s typical payment
terms tend to vary by region, but its standard payment terms are within 30 days of invoice.

Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(Unaudited)
Subscription
Subscription
revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the product is made available
to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 12 to 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance
in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.
Post
Contract Support
Revenue
from support services and product updates, referred to as subscription and support revenue, is recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software
product updates and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. The Company’s customers
purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew
their support services contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.
Professional
Services
Revenue
from professional services is typically comprised of implementation, development, data migration, training or other consulting services.
Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation
to data conversion and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes
revenue for time-and-materials arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services
are performed as measured by costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs to complete the services project. Management applies
judgment when estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external
factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement
changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources and payments are
typically due 30 days after invoice.
BPO and Internet
Services
Revenue
from BPO services is recognized based on the stage of completion which is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a
percentage of total estimated labor hours for each contract. Internet services are invoiced either monthly, quarterly or half yearly
in advance to the customers and revenue is recognized ratably overtime on a monthly basis.

Significant
Judgments
Due
to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 for the Company’s arrangements
may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.
Judgment
is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company rarely licenses or sells products on a stand-alone
basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly
observable because the Company does not sell the license, product or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information
that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes various factors, including
its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic
conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers.
The
most significant inputs involved in the Company’s revenue recognition policies are: The (1) stand-alone selling prices of the Company’s
software license, and the (2) the method of recognizing revenue for installation/customization, and other services.
The
stand-alone selling price of the licenses was measured primarily through an analysis of pricing that management evaluated when quoting
prices to customers. Although the Company has no history of selling its software separately from post contract support and other services,
the Company does have historical experience with amending contracts with customers to provide additional modules of its software or providing
those modules at an optional price. This information guides the Company in assessing the stand-alone selling price of the Company’s
software, since the Company can observe instances where a customer had a particular component of the Company’s software that was
essentially priced separate from other goods and services that the Company delivered to that customer.
The
Company recognizes revenue from implementation and customization services using the percentage of estimated “man-days” that
the work requires. The Company believes the level of effort to complete the services is best measured by the amount of time (measured
as an employee working for one day on implementation/customization work) that is required to complete the implementation or customization
work. The Company reviews its estimate of man-days required to complete implementation and customization services each reporting period.

Revenue
is recognized over time for the Company’s subscription, post contract support and fixed fee professional services that are separate
performance obligations. For the Company’s professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred
or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects.
A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization, specification variances and
testing requirement changes.
If
a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement,
such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. The Company exercises significant judgment
to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single
arrangement. The Company’s judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation
of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.
If
a contract includes variable consideration, the Company exercises judgment in estimating the amount of consideration to which the entity
will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. When estimating variable consideration, the
Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Variable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price
only when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.
Contract Balances
The
timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in receivables,
contract assets (revenues in excess of billings), or contract liabilities (unearned revenue) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The Company records revenues in excess of billings when the Company has transferred goods or services but does not yet have the
right to consideration. The Company records unearned revenue when the Company has received or has the right to receive consideration
but has not yet transferred goods or services to the customer.
The
revenues in excess of billings are transferred to receivables when the rights to consideration become unconditional, usually upon completion
of a milestone.
The
Company’s revenues in excess of billings and unearned revenue are as follows:
SCHEDULE

As of

$ 4,048,768
$ 4,901,562
During
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $ 675,857
and $ 2,784,572
that was included in the
unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period. All other activity in unearned revenue is due to the timing of invoicing in
relation to the timing of revenue recognition.

Revenue
allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied,
or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods.
Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $ 36,000,000
as of December 31, 2022, of which the Company estimates to recognize
approximately $ 14,500,000
in revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder over an estimated
3
years thereafter. Actual revenue recognition depends in part
on the timing of software modules installed at various customer sites. Accordingly, some factors that affect the Company’s revenue,
such as the availability and demand for modules within customer geographic locations, is not entirely within the Company’s control.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts
generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified
and predictable ways of purchasing the Company’s products and services, and not to facilitate financing arrangements.
Unearned
Revenue
The
Company typically invoices its customers for subscription and support fees in advance on a quarterly or annual basis, with payment due
at the start of the subscription or support term. Unpaid invoice amounts for non-cancelable license and services starting in future periods
are included in accounts receivable and unearned revenue.
Practical
Expedients and Exemptions
There
are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under Topic 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and the Company’s
disclosures. The Company has applied the following practical expedients:
●
The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year or less from the
transfer of the promised items to the customer.
●
The Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the amortization period would have been one
year or less or the commissions are based on cashed received. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.
●
The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue
at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements).
Costs
to Obtain a Contract
The
Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any balance sheet date. In general, the Company
incurs few direct incremental costs of obtaining new customer contracts. The Company rarely incurs incremental costs to review or otherwise
enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, the Company’s sales personnel receive fees that are referred to
as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new customers. The Company’s sales personnel are required to
perform additional duties beyond new customer contract inception dates, including fulfillment duties and collections efforts.

LEASES
The Company leases
certain office space, office equipment and autos with remaining lease terms of
one year
to
10
years under leases classified as financing
and operating. For certain leases, the Company has options to extend the lease term for additional periods ranging from
one year
to
10
years.
The
Company treats a contract as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period of time in exchange
for consideration, or the Company directs the use of the asset and obtains substantially all the economic benefits of the asset. These
leases are recorded as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease obligation liabilities for leases with terms greater than 12
months. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the entirety of the lease term. Lease liabilities
represent the Company’s obligation to make payments over the life of the lease. A ROU asset and a lease liability are recognized
at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the life of the lease. Initial direct costs are included
as part of the ROU asset upon commencement of the lease. Since the interest rate implicit in a lease is generally not readily determinable
for the operating leases, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental
borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease
term to obtain an asset of similar value.
The
Company reviews the impairment of ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for the Company’s other long-lived assets. The
Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying
value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the Company’s ability to recover the
carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations.
The
Company elected the practical expedient to exclude short-term leases (leases with original terms of 12 months or less) from ROU asset
and lease liability accounts.
Lease
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. Variable
payments change due to facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and do not result
in a re-measurement of lease liabilities. The Company’s variable lease payments include payments for finance leases that are adjusted
based on a change in the Karachi Inter Bank Offer Rate. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any significant residual
value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
During
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued
13,755
and
26,415
shares of common stock for services rendered by
the independent members of the Board of Directors as part of their board compensation. These shares were valued at the fair market value
of $ 39,750
and $ 79,500 , respectively.
NOTE 17 –
CONTINGENCIES
From
time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including
tax assessments. The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired
or a liability has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records the estimated loss.
The Company provides disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both conditions
if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant
judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable.
The Company bases accruals on the best information available at the time, which can be highly subjective. The final outcome of these
matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 18 –
OPERATING SEGMENTS
The
Company has identified
three
segments for its products and services; North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our reportable segments
are business units located in different global regions. Each business unit provides similar products and services; license fees for leasing
and asset-based software, related maintenance fees, and implementation and IT consulting services. Separate management of each segment
is required because each business unit is subject to different operational issues and strategies due to their particular regional location.
The Company accounts for intra-company sales and expenses as if the sales or expenses were to third parties and eliminates them in the
consolidation.

INCOME TAXES
The
current tax provision is based on taxable income for the year determined in accordance with the prevailing law for taxation of income.
The charge for tax on income is calculated at the current rates of taxation as applicable after considering tax credit and tax rebates
available, if any. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is lower than
the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax
rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the United States. Income from the export of computer
software and its related services developed in Pakistan is exempt from tax through June 30, 2025; however, tax at the applicable rates
is charged to the income from revenue generated from other than core business activities.
During
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $ 220,056
and $ 413,404 , respectively.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $ 201,506
and $ 369,133 , respectively.
The tax is derived from non-core business activities generated from NetSol PK.

A
significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We operate in several geographical regions
as described in Note 18 “Operating Segments” within the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Weakening
of the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of increasing our revenues but also
increasing our expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Similarly, strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to
foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our expenses denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. We plan our business accordingly by deploying additional resources to areas of expansion, while continuing
to monitor our overall expenditures given the economic uncertainties of our target markets. In order to provide a framework for assessing
how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the changes in results from
one period to another period using constant currency. In order to calculate our constant currency results, we apply the current period
results to the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. In the table below, we present the change based on actual results in reported
currency and in constant currency.

Subscription
and support fees for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $6,502,669 compared to $9,374,869 for the three months ended December
31, 2021 reflecting a decrease of $2,872,200 with a decrease in constant currency of $1,717,959. The reason for the decrease in subscription
and support revenue is that in the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a one-time post contract support revenue of approximately
$3,480,00 using the catch-up approach. Subscription and support fees begin once a customer has “gone live” with our product.
Subscription and support fees are recurring in nature, and we anticipate these fees to gradually increase as we implement both our NFS
legacy products and NFS Ascent ® .

Other
Income and Expense
Other
income was $864,607 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $986,186 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This
represents a decrease of $121,579 with an increase of $88,885 on a constant currency basis. The decrease is primarily due to the foreign
currency exchange transactions. The majority of the contracts with NetSol PK are either in U.S. dollars or Euros; therefore, the currency
fluctuations will lead to foreign currency exchange gains or losses depending on the value of the PKR compared to the U.S. dollar and
the Euro. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of $657,223 in foreign currency exchange transactions
compared to $901,016 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the value of the
U.S. dollar decreased 0.7% and the Euro increased 8.5%, compared to the PKR. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the value
of the U.S. dollar and the Euro increased 3.8% and 1.6%, respectively, compared to the PKR.

Interest
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was $309,037, compared to net income
of $1,031,763 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in non-controlling interest is primarily due to the decrease
in net income of NetSol PK.
Net
loss attributable to NetSol
The
net loss was $2,092,926 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of $1,406,785 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021. This is a decrease of $3,499,711 with a decrease of $4,142,007 on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior
year. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net loss per share was $0.19 for basic and diluted shares compared to net income
per share of $0.13 for basic and diluted shares for the three months ended December 31, 2021.

an increase of $530,675 with an increase in constant currency of $787,416. The increase in travel expense is due to the increase in travel
as countries begin lifting travel restrictions.

increased from 41.8% to 49.2%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in selling expenses and research and
development costs offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses.
Selling
expenses were $3,769,639 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $3,427,155, for the six months ended December 31, 2021

$1,394,289 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in non-controlling interest is primarily due to the decrease in net
income of NetSol PK.

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
Regulation
S-K Item 10(e), “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use
of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share meet the definition
of a non-GAAP financial measure.
We
define the non-GAAP measures as follows:
●
EBITDA
is GAAP net income or loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.
●
Non-GAAP
adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense.
●
Adjusted
EBITDA per basic and diluted share – Adjusted EBITDA allocated to common stock divided by the weighted average shares outstanding
and diluted shares outstanding.
We
use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believe that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to
investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring
our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and
in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single
financial measure in evaluating the Company.
The
non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:
EBITDA :
We report EBITDA as a non-GAAP metric by excluding the effect of net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization
from net income or loss because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent. In addition,
we believe providing an EBITDA calculation is a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.
Stock-based
compensation expense : We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from the non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP
adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with
current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense
which generally requires cash settlement by NetSol, and therefore is not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We
also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating
results of our peers.
Non-controlling
interest : We add back the non-controlling interest in calculating gross adjusted EBITDA and then subtract out the income taxes, depreciation
and amortization and net interest expense attributable to the non-controlling interest to arrive at a net adjusted EBITDA.

Our
cash position was $20,946,722 at December 31, 2022, compared to $23,963,797 at June 30, 2022.
Net
cash provided by operating activities was $1,689,543 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash used in operating
activities of $3,036,634 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, we had current assets of $43,076,510 and current
liabilities of $19,358,221. We had accounts receivable of $4,595,675 at December 31, 2022 compared to $8,669,202 at June 30, 2022. We
had revenues in excess of billings of $15,389,951 at December 31, 2022 compared to $15,425,377 at June 30, 2022 of which $604,358 and
$853,601 is shown as long term as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The long-term portion was discounted by $9,376
and $28,339 at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, using the discounted cash flow method with interest rates ranging from
4.65% to 6.25%. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, our revenues in excess of billings were reclassified to accounts receivable
pursuant to billing requirements detailed in each contract. The combined totals for accounts receivable and revenues in excess of billings
decreased by $4,108,953 from $24,094,579 at June 30, 2022 to $19,985,626 at December 31, 2022. Accounts payable and accrued expenses,
and current portions of loans and lease obligations amounted to $7,423,248 and $7,386,750, respectively at December 31, 2022. Accounts
payable and accrued expenses, and current portions of loans and lease obligations amounted to $6,813,541 and $8,567,145, respectively
at June 30, 2022.
The
average days sales outstanding for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 162 and 137 days, respectively, for each period.
The days sales outstanding have been calculated by taking into consideration the average combined balances of accounts receivable and
revenues in excess of billings.
Net
cash used in investing activities was $1,182,042 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $572,180 for the six months
ended December 31, 2021. We had purchases of property and equipment of $1,252,325 compared to $773,953 for the six months ended December
31, 2021.
Net
cash used in financing activities was $537,180 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $626,955 for the six months ended
December 31, 2021. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, we purchased 22,510 shares of our own stock for $100,106. The six months
ended December 31, 2021 included the cash inflow of $188,272 from bank proceeds. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we had
net payments for bank loans and finance leases of $537,180 compared to $715,121 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. We are operating
in various geographical regions of the world through our various subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries have financial arrangements from various
financial institutions to meet both their short and long-term funding requirements. These loans will become due at different maturity
dates as described in Note 15 of the financial statements. We are in compliance with the covenants of the financial arrangements and
there is no default, which may lead to early payment of these obligations. We anticipate paying back all these obligations on their respective
due dates from its own sources.
We
typically fund the cash requirements for our operations in the U.S. through our license, services, and subscription and support agreements,
intercompany charges for corporate services, and through the exercise of options and warrants. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately
$20.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately $18.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $24.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately $22.8
million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
We
remain open to strategic relationships that would provide value added benefits. The focus will remain on continuously improving cash
reserves internally and reduced reliance on external capital raise.
As
a growing company, we have on-going capital expenditure needs based on our short term and long-term business plans. Although our requirements
for capital expenses vary from time to time, for the next 12 months, we anticipate needing $2.5 million for APAC, U.S. and Europe new
business development activities and infrastructure enhancements, which we expect to provide from current operations.
While
there is no guarantee that any of these methods will result in raising sufficient funds to meet our capital needs or that even if available
will be on terms acceptable to us, we will be very cautious and prudent about any new capital raise given the global market uncertainties.
However, we are very conscious of the dilutive effect and price pressures in raising equity-based capital.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our
condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared applying certain critical accounting policies. The SEC defines “critical
accounting policies” as those that require application of management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Critical accounting policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to
variations and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Changes in underlying
