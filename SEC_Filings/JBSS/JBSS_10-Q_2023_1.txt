NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
(Dollars in thousands, except where noted and per share data)
Note 1 – Basis of Presentation and Description of Business
As used herein, unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” or “Company” collectively refer to John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, JBSS Ventures, LLC. Our fiscal year ends on the final Thursday of June each year, and typically consists of
fifty-two
weeks (four thirteen-week quarters). Additional information on the comparability of the periods presented is as follows:
•
References herein to fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 are to the 52 week fiscal year ending June 29, 2023 and the 53 week fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, respectively.
•
References herein to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 are to the quarters ended December 29, 2022 and December 23, 2021, respectively.
•
References herein to the first half or first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 are to the
twenty-six
weeks ended December 29, 2022 and December 23, 2021, respectively.
We are one of the leading processors and distributors of peanuts, pecans, cashews, walnuts, almonds and other nuts in the United States. These nuts are sold under our
Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest,
Squirrel Brand
and
Southern Style Nuts
brand names and under a variety of private brands. We also market and distribute, and in most cases, manufacture or process, a diverse product line of food and snack products, including peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, candy and confections, snack and trail mixes, snack bites, sunflower kernels, dried fruit, corn snacks, chickpea snacks, sesame sticks and other sesame snack products under our brand names and under private brands. In addition, with our acquisition of the
Just the Cheese
brand, we will now be able to expand our product offerings to include baked cheese snack products on a branded and private label basis.
Our products are sold through
three
primary distribution channels, including food retailers in the consumer channel, commercial ingredient users and contract packaging customers.
The accompanying unaudited financial statements fairly present the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and consolidated statements of cash flows, and reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which are necessary for the fair statement of the results of the interim periods. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. The balance sheet data as of June 30, 2022 was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Accordingly, these unaudited financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form
10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Note 2 – Acquisition of
Just the Cheese
Brand
On
December 16, 2022 , we completed the acquisition of certain assets (the “Acquisition”) of Specialty Cheese Company, Inc. The acquired assets are primarily related to the manufacturing and sale of baked cheese snack products, including those products sold under the
Just the Cheese
brand, all finished goods inventory, and intangible assets. At the time of closing, the full purchase price of
$ 3,500
was paid in cash and funded from our Credit Facility (as defined below) .
Just the Cheese
is one of the nation’s leading baked cheese snacking brands and offers 100% real cheese snack bars and cheese crisps.
The Acquisition will provide us with a product that expands our portfolio into new snacking categories and is anticipated to accelerate growth with our private brand and food service customers. The Acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations”.

Table of Contents
The total purchase price of $ 3,500
has been allocated on a preliminary basis to the fair values of the assets acquired as follows:

$
240
Fixed assets
500
Identifiable intangible assets:
Customer relationships
270
Brand names
80
Non-compete
agreement
30
Goodwill
2,380
Total purchase price
$
3,500
The customer relationship assets represent the value of the long-term strategic relationship with significant customers who purchase
Just the Cheese
brand products. The brand name asset represents the value of the established
Just the Cheese
brand name.
Goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for
tax purposes , arises from intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and expected synergies from combining the operations related to the
Just the Cheese
brand with those of the Company.
There were no material contingencies recognized or unrecognized associated with the acquired business.
The purchase price allocation, specifically amounts allocated to goodwill and fixed assets, are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustments to reflect the final valuations.
Due to the immaterial financial nature of the Acquisition, unaudited pro forma results of operations of the Company (as if the Acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2023) will not be presented.
Since the Acquisition, we continue to operate in a single reportable operating segment that consists of selling various nut and
nut-related
products through three sales distribution channels.
Note 3 – Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For each customer contract, a five-step process is followed in which we identify the contract, identify performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognize the revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
When Performance Obligations Are Satisfied
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue recognition. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company’s performance obligations are primarily for the delivery of raw and processed recipe and snack nuts, nut butters and trail mixes.
Our customer contracts do not include more than one performance obligation. If a contract were to contain more than one performance obligation, we are required to allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for each distinct good is generally determined by directly observable data.
Revenue recognition is generally completed at a point in time when product control is transferred to the customer. For virtually all of our revenues, control transfers to the customer when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer based upon applicable shipping terms, as the customer can then direct the use and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset at that point in time. Therefore, the timing of our revenue recognition requires little judgment.

Table of Contents
Variable Consideration
Some of our products are sold through specific incentive programs consisting of promotional allowances, volume and customer rebates,
in-store
display incentives and marketing allowances, among others, to consumer and some commercial ingredient customers. The ultimate cost of these programs is dependent on certain factors such as actual purchase volumes or customer activities and is dependent on significant management judgment when determining estimates. The Company accounts for these programs as variable consideration and recognizes a reduction in revenue (and a corresponding reduction in the transaction price) in the same period as the underlying program based upon the terms of the specific arrangements.
Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are also offered through various programs to customers and consumers. A provision for estimated trade promotions is recorded as a reduction of revenue (and a reduction in the transaction price) in the same period when the sale is recognized. Revenues are also recorded net of expected customer deductions which are provided for based upon past experiences. Evaluating these estimates requires management judgment.
We generally use the most likely amount method to determine the variable consideration. We believe there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration when any related uncertainties are resolved with our customers. The Company reviews and updates its estimates and related accruals of variable consideration and trade promotions at least quarterly based on the terms of the agreements and historical experience. Any uncertainties in the ultimate resolution of variable consideration due to factors outside of the Company’s influence are typically resolved within a short timeframe, therefore, no additional constraint on the variable consideration is required.
Contract Balances
Contract assets or liabilities result from transactions with revenue recorded over time. If the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations the Company records a contract asset. Conversely, if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights, the Company records a contract liability. There was
no
contract asset balance for any periods presented. The Company generally does not have material deferred revenue or contract liability balances arising from transactions with customers.
Disaggregation of Revenue

Note 4 – Leases
Description of Leases
We lease equipment used in the transportation of goods in our warehouses, as well as a limited number of automobiles and a small warehouse near our Bainbridge, Georgia facility. Our leases generally do not contain
non-lease
components and do not contain any explicit guarantees of residual value. Our leases for warehouse transportation equipment generally require the equipment to be returned to the lessor in good working order.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and analyze the lease to determine if it is operating or finance. Operating lease
right-of-use
assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease
right-of-use
assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental collateralized borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Implicit rates are used when readily determinable. None of our leases currently contain options to extend the term. In the event of an option to extend the term of a lease, the lease term used in measuring the liability would include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
10
Table of Contents
Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term. Our leases have remaining terms of up to
5.2
years.
It is our accounting policy to not apply lease recognition requirements to short term leases, defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. As such, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have also made the policy election to not separate lease and
non-lease
components for all leases.
The following table provides supplemental information related to operating lease

Lessor Accounting
We lease office space in our four-story office building located in Elgin, Illinois. As a lessor, we retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment property and under Topic 842:
Leases
we continue to account for all of our leases as operating leases. Lease agreements may include options to renew. We accrue fixed lease income on a
straight-line
basis over the terms of the leases. There is generally no variable lease consideration and an immaterial amount of
non-lease
components such as recurring utility and storage fees. Leases between related parties are immaterial.

Note 12 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
We are currently a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While management pres entl y believes that the ultimate outcomes of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially affect our Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable outcomes could occur. Unfavorable outcomes could include substantial monetary damages in excess of any appropriate accruals, which management has established. Were such unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Note 13 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Financial Accounting Standards Board defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
Level 1
–
Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2
–
Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
Level 3
–
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available.
The carrying values of cash, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values at each balance sheet date because of the short-term maturities and nature of these balances.
16
Table of Contents
The carrying value of our revolving credit facility borrowings approximates fair value at each balance sheet date because interest rates on this instrument approximate current market rates (Level 2 criteria) and because of the short-term maturity and nature of this balance. In addition, there has been no significant change in our inherent credit risk.
The following table summarizes the carrying value and fair value estimate of our current and long-term debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs:

Fair value of current and long-term debt:

The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was determined using a market approach based upon Level 2 observable inputs, which estimates fair value based on interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality or broker quotes. In addition, there have been no significant changes in the underlying assets securing our long-term debt.
Note 14 – Garysburg, North Carolina Facility
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we sold the Garysburg property and remaining equipment located at the property to a third party for $ 4,000 , subject to customary adjustments to reflect closing costs, which resulted in a $ 2,349
gain.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
OVERVIEW
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our fiscal year ends on the final Thursday of June each year, and typically consists of
fifty-two
weeks (four thirteen-week quarters). Additional information on the comparability of the periods presented is as follows:
•
References herein to fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 are to the 52 week fiscal year ending June 29, 2023 and the 53 week fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, respectively.
•
References herein to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 are to the quarters ended December 29, 2022 and December 23, 2021, respectively.
•
References herein to the first half or first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 are to the
twenty-six
weeks ended December 29, 2022 and December 23, 2021, respectively.
As used herein, unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” or “Company” collectively refer to John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, JBSS Ventures, LLC.
We are one of the leading processors and distributors of peanuts, pecans, cashews, walnuts, almonds and other nuts in the United States. These nuts are sold under our
Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest,
Squirrel Brand
and
Southern Style Nuts
brand names and under a variety of private brands. We also market and distribute, and in most cases, manufacture or process, a diverse product line of food and snack products, including peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, candy and confections, snack and trail mixes, snack bites, sunflower kernels, dried fruit, corn snacks, chickpea snacks, sesame sticks and other sesame snack products under our brand names and under private brands. In addition, with our acquisition of the
Just the Cheese
brand, we will now be able to expand our product offerings to include baked cheese snack products on a branded and private label basis. We distribute our products in the consumer, commercial ingredients and contract packaging distribution channels.
During fiscal 2022, we created a Long-Range Plan to define our future growth priorities. Our Long-Range Plan focuses on growing our
non-branded
business across key customers, transforming
Fisher,  Orchard Valley Harvest
and
Squirrel Brand  into leading brands while increasing distribution and diversifying our portfolio into high growth snacking segments. We plan to execute on our Long-Range Plan by providing our
non-branded
customers with value-added solutions based on our extensive industry and consumer expertise. We will grow our branded business by reaching new consumers via product expansion and packaging innovation, expanding distribution across current and alternative channels, diversifying our product offerings and focusing on new ways for consumers to buy our products, including sales via
e-commerce
platforms. This Long-Range Plan also contemplates increasing our sales through product innovation and targeted, opportunistic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the
Just the Cheese
brand completed during the current second quarter.
We will continue to focus our promotional and advertising activity to invest in our brands to achieve growth. We intend to execute an omnichannel approach to win in key categories including recipe nuts, snack nuts, trail mix and other snacking categories. We continue to see strong
e-commerce
performance across our branded portfolio and anticipate taking various actions with the goal of accelerating that growth across a variety of established and emerging platforms. We will continue to face the ongoing challenges specific to our business, such as food safety and regulatory issues and the maintenance and growth of our customer base for branded and private label products. See the information referenced in Part II, Item 1A — “Risk Factors” of this report for additional information about our risks, challenges and uncertainties.
We face a number of challenges in the future, which include significant inflation, potential for economic downturn, supply chain challenges and, to a lesser extent, the lingering impacts of
COVID-19.
We have also experienced a tightening in the labor market for those employed at our production facilities, which has led to increased labor costs.
18
Table of Contents
Inflation and Consumer Trends
We face changing industry trends as consumer purchasing preferences evolve. Due to significant inflation, including higher commodity acquisition costs in fiscal 2022, we have seen higher selling prices at retail. With higher prices across our categories and the broader food market, and also due to any actual or potential economic downturn, consumers may purchase fewer snack products, as we have seen through the recent decline in the recipe and snack nut categories, shift their preferences to private brands or lower priced nuts or purchase snack products outside the nut and trail mix category. With the inflationary environment, we are also seeing signs of consumers shifting to more value-focused retailers, such as mass merchandising retailers, club stores and dollar stores.
E-commerce
platforms showed growth during the first half of fiscal 2023 but at a lower rate than we saw during the first half of fiscal 2022.
Supply Chain and Transportation
In recent quarters, we have faced challenges with shortages and cost increases for shipping pallets, packaging, imported ingredients, transportation and shipping availability. The conflict in Ukraine has further exacerbated supply chain disruptions, especially related to sunflower oil used in roasting our nut products. Overall packaging costs appear to be leveling off but remain well above
pre-pandemic
levels. In addition, we are seeing some relief in select ingredient categories with reformulations and substitutions, but lead-times remain long compared to
pre-pandemic
lead-times.
We have also experienced supply chain issues related to a shortage in capacity in the transportation industry. This tightening in transportation capacity began to ease during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and has continued to ease into fiscal 2023 as inflation resulted in rising costs which decreased demand in the freight market. Although we have seen stabilization in truckload capacity and volume at U.S. ports, there is continued pressure on driver hiring and fuel and energy concerns due to continued unrest abroad. Fuel prices that were at record highs during spring and summer 2022 have begun to decrease, yet still remain volatile. While there are indicators of transportation cost improvement, and despite our mitigation of some of the transportation shortages and maintaining high service levels, we may continue to face an unpredictable transportation environment. There is no guarantee that our mitigation strategies will continue to be effective, that any transportation capacity easing will continue or that transportation prices will return to more normalized levels.
These shortages and related challenges have impacted our operations and resulted in increased expenses and manufacturing inefficiencies that have adversely impacted (and may continue to impact) our net income. We anticipate pricing relief in some of these areas in the coming quarters, if and as shortages decrease and supply chains normalize; however, we expect that some costs may remain elevated or unpredictable for a longer period of time, particularly as the conflict in Ukraine continues.
We are working, and will continue to work, with our vendors, customers and suppliers to source additional raw materials and packaging supplies and to remain flexible in obtaining the transportation and labor services we need. If these shortages and other supply chain issues continue and we cannot secure adequate supplies to fulfill customer orders or cannot obtain the transportation and labor services we need, such shortages and supply chain issues could have an unfavorable impact on net sales and our operations during the remainder of fiscal year 2023. In addition, as costs increase due to these issues or due to inflationary pressures in general, there is an additional risk of not being able to pass (in part or in full) such potential cost increases onto our customers or in a timely manner. If we cannot align costs with prices for our products, our operating performance could be adversely impacted.
COVID-19
During fiscal 2023, we may continue to face challenges as a result of the
COVID-19
pandemic. During fiscal 2022, as various
COVID-19
vaccines and therapeutic measures became more widely distributed and accepted by the public and indoor dining restrictions were again loosened, we saw a significant improvement in sales volume with our foodservice, restaurant, convenience store and
non-essential
retail customers.

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS
Our net sales of $274.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 8.3% from our net sales of $253.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 increased by $47.4 million, or 9.9%, to $526.9 million compared to the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022.
Sales volume, measured as pounds sold to customers, decreased 3.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Sales volume for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 decreased 1.1% compared to the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022.
Gross profit increased by $4.3 million, and our gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, was unchanged at 20.6% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Gross profit increased $3.1 million, and our gross profit margin decreased to 20.3% from 21.7% for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022.
Total operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased by $1.9 million, or 5.7%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased to 11.7% from 13.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. For the first half of fiscal 2023, total operating expenses increased $1.8 million, and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.4% compared to 12.2% for the first half of fiscal 2022.
The total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $5.7 million, or 3.2%, in comparison to the total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
We have seen acquisition costs for all major tree nuts decrease and acquisition costs for peanuts increase modestly in the 2022 crop year (which falls into our current 2023 fiscal year). We completed procurement of inshell walnuts during the first half of fiscal 2023. During the third quarter, we will determine the final prices to be paid to the walnut growers based upon current market prices and other factors such as crop size and export demand. We have estimated the liability to our walnut growers and our walnut inventory costs using currently available information. Any difference between our estimated liability and the actual final liability will be determined during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and will be recognized in our financial results at that time.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Sales
Our net sales increased 8.3% to $274.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to net sales of $253.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales was attributable to a 12.7% increase in the weighted average sales price per pound. This increase was partially offset by a 3.8% decrease in sales volume, which is defined as pounds sold to customers. The increase in the weighted average selling price per pound primarily resulted from higher commodity acquisition costs for pecans, cashews, peanuts and dried fruit. Sales volume for peanuts and all major tree nuts (except pecans) declined in the current quarter.
For the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 our net sales were $526.9 million, an increase of $47.4 million, or 9.9%, compared to the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales was attributable to an 11.1% increase in the weighted average selling price per pound, which was partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in sales volume. The increase in the weighted average selling price resulted from higher commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts (except walnuts), peanuts and dried fruit.
The following table summarizes sales by product type as a percentage of total gross sales. The information is based upon gross sales, rather than net sales, because certain adjustments, such as promotional discounts, are not allocable to product type.

Net sales in the consumer distribution channel increased $21.0 million, or 10.3%, and sales volume decreased 2.0% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The sales volume decrease was driven by lost private brand distribution at a grocery store retailer that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and a 24.1% sales volume decrease for
Fisher
snack nuts primarily as a result of competitive pricing pressures at two grocery store retailers and lost distribution at another grocery store retailer. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in private brand sales volume due to new private brand peanut butter business at a mass merchandising retailer and increased seasonal distribution at another mass merchandising retailer. Sales volume of
Fisher
recipe nuts increased 2.8% as a result of increased distribution at a mass merchandising retailer and at a grocery store retailer. Sales volume
of
Orchard Valley Harvest
products decreased 14.5% due to the timing of sales to a major customer in the
non-food
sector who shifted their orders into the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
In the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023, net sales in the consumer distribution channel increased $37.8 million, or 9.9%, and sales volume decreased 1.4% compared to the same period of fiscal 2022. The sales volume decrease was driven by lost private brand distribution at the grocery store retailer cited in the quarterly comparison, which was partially offset by increased distribution at a mass merchandising retailer.
Net sales in the commercial ingredients distribution channel increased 2.4% in dollars and decreased 7.7% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in sales volume was due to a 38.9% decrease in sales volume of bulk products to other food manufacturers as a result of reduced consumption from softened consumer spending. This was partially offset by a 2.9% increase in sales volume to foodservice customers due to new distribution at existing customers.
In the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023, net sales in the commercial ingredients distribution channel increased 7.2% in dollars and decreased 2.7% in sales volume compared to the same period of fiscal 2022. The decrease in sales volume was due to a 26.7% decrease in sales volume of bulk products to other food manufacturers for the reason cited in the quarterly comparison and a decrease in sales of peanut crushing stock to peanut oil processors. These decreases were largely offset by an 8.9% increase in sales volume to foodservice customers due to new distribution at existing customers and the continued recovery in the restaurant industry from the impacts of
COVID-19
restrictions.
Net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased 2.6% in dollars and 11.3% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to earlier timing for holiday shipments at a major customer in this channel.
In the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023, net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel increased 13.8% in dollars and sales volume increased 2.7% compared to the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022. The increase in sales volume was primarily attributable to business with a new customer.

Gross Profit
Gross profit increased by $4.3 million, or 8.2%, to $56.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, was unchanged at 20.6% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower acquisition costs for almonds and walnuts, which were offset by inflationary cost increases, including for labor and manufacturing supplies, increased depreciation expense and a decrease in sales volume. The increase in gross profit was mainly due to a higher net sales base.
Gross profit was $107.1 million for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to $104.0 million for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022 primarily due to a higher net sales base. Our gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 20.3% for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to 21.7% for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin in the year to date comparison was primarily attributable to higher acquisition costs for all major tree nuts (except walnuts) and peanuts, other inflationary cost increases cited in the quarterly comparison and increased depreciation expense.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased by $1.9 million, or 5.7%, to $32.0 million. Operating expenses decreased to 11.7% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 13.4% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Selling expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $21.8 million, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 7.4%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by a $1.5 million decrease in advertising expense and a $0.8 million decrease in freight expense primarily due to a decrease in freight rates, which were partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in base compensation expense and $0.2 million increase in sales broker commission expense.
Administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $10.2 million compared to $10.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease was due to a $0.8 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and a $0.5 million decrease in the loss on asset disposals, which were largely offset by a $1.0 million increase in base and equity compensation expense.
Total operating expenses for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 increased by $1.8 million, or 3.1%, to $60.3 million. Operating expenses decreased to 11.4% of net sales for the first half of fiscal 2023 compared to 12.2% of net sales for the first half of fiscal 2022.
Selling expenses for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 were $39.8 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 3.6%, from the amount recorded for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by a $2.0 million decrease in advertising expense and a $1.2 million decrease in freight expense due to a decrease in freight rates. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in base compensation expense and a $0.5 million increase in sales broker commission expense.
Administrative expenses for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 were $20.5 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 5.1%, compared to the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in base and equity compensation expense and a $0.6 million increase in audit and legal expenses primarily for Acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in the loss on asset disposals.
The $2.3 million gain on sale of facility in the first half of fiscal 2022 was the result of the sale of our Garysburg, North Carolina facility.
Income from Operations
Due to the factors discussed above, income from operations was $24.5 million, or 8.9% of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $18.3 million, or 7.2% of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Due to the factors discussed above, income from operations was $46.9 million, or 8.9% of net sales, for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to $45.6 million, or 9.5% of net sales, for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $0.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $0.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Interest expense was $1.3 million for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to $0.8 million for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022. The increase in interest expense for both the quarterly and year to date comparisons was due to higher weighted average interest rates.

Rental and Miscellaneous Expense, Net
Net rental and miscellaneous expense was $0.3 million for both the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Net rental and miscellaneous expense was $0.7 million for both the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.
Pension Expense (Excluding Service Costs)
Pension expense (excluding service costs) was $0.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $0.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Pension expense (excluding service costs) was $0.7 million for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to $1.2 million for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022. The decrease in pension expense (excluding service costs) for both the quarterly and year to date comparisons was primarily due to a decrease in the unrecognized net loss remaining to be amortized, which was a result of a large actuarial gain in the prior fiscal year.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $6.3 million, or 27.1% of income before income taxes (the “Effective Tax Rate”), for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $3.7 million, or 21.6% of income before income taxes, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. For the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023, income tax expense was $11.7 million, or 26.6% of income before income taxes, compared to $10.4 million, or 24.3% of income before income taxes, for the comparable period last year. The increase in the Effective Tax Rate for both the quarterly and
twenty-six
week periods is mainly due to the favorable impact of $0.7 million of discrete tax benefits from share-based compensation recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 that did not reoccur in the current quarter.
Net Income
Net income was $16.9 million, or $1.46 per common share basic and $1.45 per common share diluted, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $13.2 million, or $1.15 per common share basic and $1.14 per common share diluted, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Net income was $32.5 million, or $2.81 per common share basic and $2.79 per common share diluted, for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023, compared to net income of $32.5 million, or $2.82 per common share basic and $2.81 per common share diluted, for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
General
The primary uses of cash are to fund our current operations, fulfill contractual obligations, pursue our Long-Range Plan through growing our branded and private label programs and repay indebtedness, including amounts payable under the Retirement Plan. Also, various uncertainties, including cost uncertainties, could result in additional uses of cash. The primary sources of cash are results of operations and availability under our Credit Facility. We anticipate that expected net cash flow generated from operations and amounts available pursuant to the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. Our available credit under our Credit Facility has allowed us to devote more funds to promote our products, increase consumer insight capabilities and promotional efforts, reinvest in the Company through capital expenditures, develop new products, pay cash dividends, consummate strategic investments and business acquisitions, such as the Acquisition, and explore other growth strategies outlined in our Long-Range Plan.
Cash flows from operating activities have historically been driven by net income but are also significantly influenced by inventory requirements, which can change based upon fluctuations in both quantities and market prices of the various nuts and nut products we buy and sell. Current market trends in nut prices and crop estimates also impact nut procurement.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $71.0 million for the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to $15.8 million for the comparative period of fiscal 2022. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a decreased use of working capital for inventory compared to the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2022 as a result of decreasing commodity acquisition costs.
Total inventories were $173.1 million at December 29, 2022, a decrease of $31.8 million, or 15.5%, from the inventory balance at June 30, 2022, and a decrease of $5.7 million, or 3.2%, from the inventory balance at December 23, 2021. The decrease in inventories at December 29, 2022 compared to June 30, 2022 was primarily due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts and lower quantities of pecans and finished goods on hand, which were partially offset by higher quantities of walnuts, cashews and other raw materials on hand. The decrease in inventories at December 29, 2022 compared to December 23, 2021 were primarily due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts and lower quantities of finished goods and pecans on hand, which were partially offset by higher quantities of cashews, other raw materials,
work-in-process
and farmer stock peanuts.
Raw nut and dried fruit input stocks, some of which are classified as
work-in-process,
increased by 7.4 million pounds, or 15.0%, at December 29, 2022 compared to December 23, 2021 due to higher quantities of farmer stock peanuts, inshell walnuts and cashews on hand, partially offset by lower quantities of inshell pecans. The weighted average cost per pound of raw nut input stocks on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 24.2% compared to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $15.0 million during the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to $5.9 million for the same period last year. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially attributable to the $3.9 million of net proceeds received from the disposition of the Garysburg, North Carolina facility, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and did not recur in the current fiscal year. The $3.5 million purchase price for the acquisition of the
Just the Cheese
brand also contributed to the increase. Capital asset purchases were $11.4 million during the first half of fiscal 2023 compared to $9.5 million for the first half of fiscal 2022. We expect total capital expenditures for new equipment, facility upgrades, and food safety enhancements for fiscal 2023 to be approximately $18.0 to 20.0 million. Absent any material acquisitions or other significant investments, we believe that cash on hand, combined with cash provided by operations and borrowings available under the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements for planned capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities was $55.8 million during the first
twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to $9.6 million for the same period last year. Net repayments under our Credit Facility were $17.6 million during the first half of fiscal 2023 compared to net borrowings of $27.2 million for the first half of fiscal 2022. The decrease in credit facility borrowings was primarily due to decreasing commodity acquisition costs. Dividends paid in the first half of fiscal 2023 were approximately $3.0 million higher than dividends paid in the same period last year.
Real Estate Matters
In August 2008, we completed the consolidation of our Chicago-based facilities into our Elgin headquarters (“Elgin Site”). The Elgin Site includes both an office building and a warehouse. We are currently attempting to find additional tenants for the available space in the office building at the Elgin Site. Until additional tenant(s) are found, we will not receive the benefit of rental income associated with such space. Approximately 69% of the rentable area in the office building is currently vacant. Approximately 29% of the rentable area has not been
built-out.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to lease the unoccupied space and further capital expenditures will likely be necessary to lease the remaining space.

Financing Arrangements
On February 7, 2008, we entered into the Former Credit Agreement (as defined below) with a bank group (the “Bank Lenders”) providing a $117.5 million revolving loan commitment and letter of credit subfacility. Also on February 7, 2008, we entered into a Loan Agreement with an insurance company (the “Mortgage Lender”) providing us with two term loans, one in the amount of $36.0 million (“Tranche A”) and the other in the amount of $9.0 million (“Tranche B”), for an aggregate amount of $45.0 million (as amended, the “Mortgage Facility”).
On March 5, 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) which amended and restated our Credit Agreement dated as of February 7, 2008 (the “Former Credit Agreement”). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $117.5 million senior secured revolving credit facility with the same borrowing capacity, interest rates and applicable margin as the Former Credit Agreement and extends the term of the Former Credit Agreement from July 7, 2021 to March 5, 2025.
The Amended and Restated Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets other than machinery and equipment, real property, and fixtures and matures on March 5, 2025. The Mortgage Facility is secured by mortgages on essentially all of our owned real property located in Elgin, Illinois and Gustine, California (the “Encumbered Properties”).
Credit Facility
At our election, borrowings under the Credit Facility currently accrue interest at either (i) a rate determined pursuant to the administrative agent’s prime rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the amount of loans which may be advanced under the borrowing base calculation, ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% or (ii) a rate based upon the London interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin based upon the borrowing base calculation, ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%.
At December 29, 2022, the weighted average interest rate for the Credit Facility was 6.3%. The terms of the Credit Facility contain covenants that, among other things, require us to restrict investments, indebtedness, acquisitions and certain sales of assets and limit annual cash dividends or distributions, transactions with affiliates, redemptions of capital stock and prepayment of indebtedness (if such prepayment, among other things, is of a subordinate debt). If loan availability under the borrowing base calculation falls below $25.0 million, we will be required to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio, tested on a monthly basis, until loan availability equals or exceeds $25.0 million for three consecutive months. All cash received from customers is required to be applied against the Credit Facility. The Bank Lenders have the option to accelerate and demand immediate repayment of our obligations under the Credit Facility in the event of default on the payments required under the Credit Facility, a change in control in the ownership of the Company,
non-compliance
with the financial covenant or upon the occurrence of other defaults by us under the Credit Facility (including a default under the Mortgage Facility). As of December 29, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and we currently expect to be in compliance with the financial covenant in the Credit Facility for the foreseeable future. At December 29, 2022, we had $90.5 million of available credit under the Credit Facility. If this entire amount were borrowed at December 29, 2022, we would still be in compliance with all restrictive covenants under the Credit Facility.
Mortgage Facility
The Mortgage Facility matures on March 1, 2023, and the remaining balance of $0.9 million will be paid in full during our fiscal 2023 third quarter. On March 1, 2018 the interest rate on the Mortgage Facility was fixed at 4.25% per annum. Monthly principal payments on the Mortgage Facility in the amount of $0.3 million commenced on June 1, 2008.
Selma Property
In September 2006, we sold our Selma, Texas properties (the “Selma Properties”) to two related party partnerships for $14.3 million and are leasing them back. The selling price was determined by an independent appraiser to be the fair market value which also approximated our carrying value. The lease for the Selma Properties has a
ten-year
term at a fair market value rent with three five-year renewal options. In September 2015, we exercised two of the five-year renewal options which extended the lease term to September 2026. The lease extension also reduced the monthly lease payment on the Selma Properties, beginning in September 2016, to reflect then current market conditions. At the end of each five-year renewal option, the base monthly lease amounts are reassessed, and the monthly payments increased to $114 beginning in September 2021. One five-year renewal option remains. Also, we have an option to purchase the Selma Properties from the owner at 95% (100% in certain circumstances) of the then fair market value, but not less than the original $14.3 million purchase price. The provisions of the arrangement are not eligible for sale-leaseback accounting and the $14.3 million was recorded as a debt obligation. No gain or loss was recorded on the Selma Properties transaction. As of December 29, 2022, $8.1 million of the debt obligation was outstanding.
