in 33 states, with financing provided by institutional lenders. The Company also maintained a full underwriting and servicing platform
for its portfolio. Notwithstanding the discontinuance of our initial focus on consumer loans and leases post Lehman and during the 2008
financial crisis, in 2007, the Company introduced a new initiative, Municipal Financing ( www.spartamunicipal.com ), which has financed
over 100 jurisdictions to date. Sparta’s Municipal Finance program is available to all nonprofit organizations, institutions, and
entities. All nonprofit organizations which adhere to I.R.S. guidelines, including 501 (c) 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible.
Both public nonprofits, also known as public charities supported with publicly collected funds, and private nonprofits, also known as
private foundations backed by an individual or business entity, qualify for the program.
Consumers,
retailers, municipals, nonprofits, auction houses, banks, and insurance companies scrutinize title history reports for the vital information
needed and factored into crucial business decisions affecting the bottom line. Vehicle History Reports are a staple of Sparta’s
E-Commerce Technology subsidiary iMobile Solutions, Inc. Whether a vehicle is intended for business or recreational use, Sparta’s
Vehicle History Reports are highly regarded for accuracy and completeness. They have been sold across all 50 states and in 62 countries
worldwide. They provide a trusted layer of assurance to vehicle buyers and are available on our websites as well as on various dealership
websites. They include Cyclechex (Motorcycle History Reports at
www.cyclechex.com ), RVchex (Recreational Vehicle History Reports
at
www.rvchex.com ), and Truckchex (Heavy Duty Truck History Reports at
www.truckchex.com ).
The
Company’s E-Commerce and Mobile Technology subsidiary name change to iMobile Solutions, Inc., from Specialty Reports, Inc., in
2016, signifies its ever-broadening service offerings in the evolving technology landscape. With iMobile App ( www.imobileapp.com ),
the Company provides mobile technology services, including web and mobile application creation, development, and management for a wide
range of businesses to increase revenue, build brand recognition, and improve customer engagement. Our ever-broadening business base
of mobile applications includes vehicle dealerships and racetracks, private clubs and country clubs, schools and entertainment venues,
restaurants, grocery stores, and various other merchant types. ( www.imobileapp.com/app-gallery ). The Company also designs, launches,
maintains, and hosts websites for businesses incorporating SEO (search engine optimization), social media marketing, and online reviews
to improve their presence online.

Company management recognized the substantial business
opportunity in the rapidly expanding hemp-CBD (cannabidiol) market in the United States. Sparta created its subsidiary, New World Health
Brands, Inc., in April 2019, on the heels of the Agriculture Improvement Act (also known as the Farm Bill), signed into law last December
20, 2018. Consequently, regulators removed hemp (CBD) from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. During 2019-2020, we sourced,
developed, and tested 5 CBD product categories totaling 31 products. We procured premium, domestic-grade, full-spectrum, broad-spectrum,
and THC-free hemp, created product packaging and labeling, and implemented fulfillment to launch an online Business-to-Consumer (“B
to C”) website:
www.newworldhealthcbd.com
on December 21, 2019.
Sparta’s
response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 quickly took shape with thorough investigations into evolving customer trends
in health and wellness. As a result, we expanded New World Health Brands and developed a new product line of natural dietary supplements.
In August 2020, we launched an online B to C website:
www.newworldhealthbrands.com , featuring high-quality nutritional supplements,
including vitamins and minerals, such as Zinc, Magnesium, Boron, Iodine, Beetroot Extract, Selenium, Vitamin B Complex, Vitamin C and
PQQ. All health and wellness offerings are exclusively sourced and manufactured in the United States and adhere to strict U.S. standards
and guidelines to ensure the safety and quality of our products. Sparta’s commitment to high standards and transparency is tantamount
to being a trusted brand.
Sparta’s
subsidiary, Sparta Crypto, Inc., www.SpartaCrypto.com, was established on September 25, 2020, and is in the process of completing a proprietary
state-of-the-art platform designed to connect users of widely adopted digital currencies with sellers of various goods and services.
The platform has not launched and the Company can make no assurances that the described plan will reach implementation. In addition,
the Company has completed and tested a cryptocurrency payment gateway called SpartaPayIQ,
www.SpartaPayIQ.com , which is functional
and was formally announced on March 3, 2022.
Agoge Global USA, Inc. was formed as a subsidiary
of Sparta Crypto, Inc. in December 2022 and entered in to a Joint Venture Agreement with WeDev Group to facilitate cross-border transactions
between importers and exporters of goods from the U.S. and Brazil. In addition, Agoge Global USA provides business intermediary services
to global importers and exporters of goods and services. These services include, but are not limited to, industry introductions, tax compliance
assistance, import and export documentation assistance, reselling services in other jurisdictions, and facilitation of cross-border transactions.

Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2023, and for the nine months ended January 31,
2023, and 2022 have been prepared by the Company according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including
Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and
adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present the operating results for the respective periods fairly.
Certain information and footnote disclosures usually present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted under such rules and regulations. The Company believes that the
disclosures provided are adequate to make the information presented accurate.
These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
and explanatory notes for the year ended April 30, 2022, as disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-K for that year as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on August 15, 2022. The results of operations for the nine months ended January 31, 2022, are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or the full year ending April 30, 2023.
The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2022, contained herein has been derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements as of April 30, 2022, but does not include all disclosures required by the U.S. GAAP.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The third-party ownership of the Company’s subsidiary is accounted
for as noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements. Changes in the noncontrolling interest are reported in the statement
of changes in deficit.
Estimates
These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosures
of revenues and expenses for the said period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue
Recognition
During
the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted A.S.U. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , using the cumulative-effect
method. The new standard requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The adoption did
not impact our consolidated financial statements other than enhancing our disclosures related to our revenue-generating activities.
The
Company acts as a principal in its revenue transactions as it is the primary obligor.

including refundable amounts.

Cash
Equivalents
All
liquid investments with three months or less maturity are cash equivalents for the accompanying financial statements.
Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company has adopted ASC 820,
“Fair Value Measurements
(“ASC 820”) .”
ASC 820 establishes a three-level
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The scale gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs to fair value measurements of certain assets
and Liabilities. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:
●
Level
1 —
Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities,
derivative contracts traded in an active exchange market, and certain highly liquid securities actively traded in over-the-counter
markets.
●
Level
2 —
Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in
active markets.
●
Level
3 —
Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value measurements. Level
3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies,
or similar techniques based on significant unobservable inputs, as well as management judgments or estimates that are significant
to the valuation.
This
hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data when available and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining
fair value. Observable inputs may not always be available for some products or in certain market conditions.
Income
Taxes
We
utilize ASC 740, “ Income Taxes ,” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized
for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at year-end based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income.
The
Company recognizes the impact of a
position in the financial statements only if that position is more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Our practice recognizes interest or penalties related
to income tax matters in income tax expense.
Stock-Based
Compensation
We
account for our stock-based compensation under ASC 718 “ Compensation–Stock Compensation ” using the fair value-based
method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award. It is recognized over the
service period, usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for accounting transactions in which an entity exchanges
its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods
or services based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments, or the issuance of those equity instruments may settle
that.
We
use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and the Black-Scholes model to measure options’ fair
value. The stock-based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or at which the performance of the services
is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods.
10
Inventories
The
Company’s inventories represent finished goods, consisting of available products. They are accounted for using the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method and valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory consists of finished goods for the Company’s New
World Health business.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Minor additions and renewals are expensed in the year incurred. Significant additions and renewals
are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of significant depreciable assets are as follows:
SCHEDULE
OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Leasehold improvements
3 years
Furniture
and fixtures
7 years
Website
costs
3 years
Computer
Equipment
5 years
Concentrations
of Credit Risk
Financial
instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash
equivalents, and receivables. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with high-credit quality institutions. At times,
such investments may be more than the FDIC insurance limit.
Net
Loss Per Share
The
Company uses ASC 260-10, “ Earnings Per Share ” for calculating the basic and diluted loss per share. The Company computes
basic loss per share by dividing net loss and net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of net loss per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.
As
of January 31, 2023, and April 30, 2022, approximately 32,350,243 potential shares (including 23,433,438 and 8,916,805 shares to be issued
on the balance sheet), respectively, were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would
reduce the net loss per share.
Derivative
Liabilities
The
Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of January 31, 2023, and April 30, 2022, which consist
of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Company’s common stock. It determined that such derivatives meet the criteria
for liability classification under ASC 815.
ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and
account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and
risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported
in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered
a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument
is deemed conventional, as described.
11
Convertible
Instruments
The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with professional standards
for “ Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities .”
ASC
815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity’s control and could or require net cash
settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability. The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when
it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional
standards when “ Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features ,” as those professional
standards pertain to “Certain Convertible Instruments.” Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible
notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based on the differences between the fair value of the
underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. The Company
also records, when necessary, deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon
the differences between the underlying common stock’s fair value at the note transaction’s commitment date and the effective
conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their
earliest redemption date.
Reclassifications
Certain
reclassifications have been made to conform with prior periods’ data to the current presentation. These reclassifications did not
affect reported losses.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements-
In
February 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02
(Topic 842) “ Leases .” Topic 842 supersedes
the lease requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (A.S.C.) Topic 840, “ Leases .” Under Topic 842, lessees
are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue
to be classified as either finance or operating. The Company adopted Topic 842 effective May 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective
method and elected not to recognize lease terms of 12 months or less. Adopting this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.
Standard-setting
organizations and various regulatory agencies are currently studying multiple proposed or potential accounting standards. Due to the
tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, we have yet to determine whether implementation of such proposed standards
would be material to our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures as included in the footnotes to the financial statements.
NOTE
B – GOING CONCERN MATTERS
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. As shown in the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses and generated negative cash flows from operating
activities since inception. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $69,448,432 and $73,984,686 respectively. A working capital deficit for the period ended January 31, 2023 and year ended April 30, 2022
(total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) of $13,454,848 and $19,344,764 respectively. The Company’s cash balance and revenues generated are
insufficient. They cannot cover our operating expenses for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Report. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from
the issuance of these financial statements.
12
The
Company’s existence depends on management’s ability to develop profitable operations. Management is devoting substantially
all its efforts to growing its business and raising capital, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts will be successful.
The management’s actions are not guaranteed to result in profitable operations or resolve liquidity problems. The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.
The
Company’s management actively pursues additional equity financing through discussions with investment bankers and private investors.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its effort to secure additional equity financing.
NOTE
C – NOTES PAYABLE AND DERIVATIVES
The
Company has numerous outstanding notes payable to various parties. The notes bear interest at rates of 5% - 20% per year and are summarized

The
balance of accrued interest of the above notes as of January 31, 2023, and April 30, 2022, were $ 1,656,450 and $2,680,787, respectively,
a significant decrease of $1,024,337 primarily due to several convertible notes having expired and being written off.
Certain
notes payable contain variable conversion rates, and the conversion features are classified as derivative liabilities. The conversion
prices are based on the market price of the Company’s common stock, at discounts of 30% - 48% to market value.
The
Company’s derivative financial instruments are embedded derivatives related to the outstanding short-term Convertible Notes Payable.
These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features indexed to the Company’s common stock. The accounting treatment
of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the derivatives and related items at their fair values as of the
inception date of the Convertible Notes Payable and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. In addition, under the provisions
of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging; Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (“ASC 815-40”),
as a result of entering into the Convertible Notes Payable, the Company is required to classify all other non-employee stock options
and warrants as derivative liabilities and mark them to market at each reporting date. Any change in fair value, including modifications
of terms, will be recorded as non-operating, non-cash income, or expense at each reporting date. If the fair value of the derivatives
is higher at the subsequent balance sheet date, the Company will record a non-operating, non-cash charge. If the fair value of the products
is lower at the subsequent balance sheet date, the Company will record non-operating, non-cash income. These Notes are subject to a six-year
Statute of Limitations in which to bring any potential claims.

The
change in fair value of the derivative liabilities on January 31, 2023, was calculated with the following average assumptions using a

NOTE
F – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The
Company follows the guidelines established according to ASC 820, which established a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure
about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e.,
an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes the following three levels of inputs that may
be used:
Level
1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.
Level
2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.
Level
3: Unobservable inputs when there is little or no market data available, thereby requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.
The
table below summarizes the fair values of financial liabilities as of January 31, 2023:

of January 31, 2023, we have not been named as parties to any further legal proceedings except those disclosed prior and updated below.
From time to time, we may become involved in other legal proceedings, which sometimes arise due to the very nature of and in the ordinary
course of this business.
By
way of background, the Company had received notices dated April 1, 2016, May 13, 2016, and July 22, 2016, from two lenders claiming defaults
relating to conversion requests of $8,365.00 in principal plus interest, attorney fees, and $5,000.00 in principal plus interest also
seeking stock conversions aside from the stated principal and interest concerning notes in the total amounts of $55,125.00 and $27,500.00,
respectively, which the Company has declined to process and believes it has valid, meritorious defenses in that regard. The Company believes
these claims are contingent and unliquidated and disputes the same. While there can be no assurances that the Company would prevail in
any potential litigation concerning allegations brought against the Company, these potential liabilities have been recorded in the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements.
For
the above claims, on September 22, 2016, a motion for summary judgment instead of complaint was filed in the Supreme Court in the
State of New York: County of Kings against the Company by a lender for the amount of $102,170.82
in principal and stock conversion interest, plus fees and costs. Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment instead of complaint
was denied on May 5, 2017. On August 22, 2018, Plaintiff brought a second motion seeking summary judgment on the liability issue,
again denied by the Court on March 14, 2019. The most recent appearance in this matter had been scheduled for March 13, 2020, at
which time the Court marked the case “adjourned without a date” due to the restrictions imposed on the Courts arising
from the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, no further Court appearances have been scheduled in this matter. However, most notably, a
favorable decision from the New York State Court of Appeals regarding the same types of transactions has since been determined to be
criminally usurious and, therefore, unenforceable management believes. These were the very same defenses raised on behalf of the Company.
On
October 26, 2018, a second lender commenced an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York: New York County alleging damages
from unpaid principal arising from a promissory note dated February 26, 2015, in the amount of $50,000.00 plus damages including interest
and stock conversions, costs and fees. The Company disputes the enforceability of such claims for similar reasons, as stated above, based
on the Court of Appeals ruling regarding the unenforceable nature of such allegations demanding usurious interest rates. On November
9, 2022 the court rendered a decision on the cross motions for summary judgment in favor of the Company granting full dismissal of all
causes of action and awarded costs in favor of the Company. The time within which for plaintiff to appeal the decision has since expired.
NOTE
J – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The
Company had evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure as of March 21, 2023 when the financial statements were
available to be issued. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved management’s recommendation to discontinue the
canabidiol (CBD) line of business effective March 31, 2023. No other matters were identified affecting the accompanying financial
statements and related disclosures.

condensed consolidated financial statements and their explanatory notes included as part of this quarterly Report and (2) our annual
audited consolidated financial statements and explanatory notes for the year ended April 30, 2022, as disclosed in our annual Report
on Form 10-K for that year as filed with the S.E.C.
“Forward-Looking”
Information
This
Report on Form 10-Q contains various statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder which represent our expectations and beliefs, including, but not limited to statements
concerning the Company’s business and financial plans and prospects and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions,
future events, or performances are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. The words “believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” and other similar expressions can, but do not always, identify
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statement was made. We base these forward-looking statements on our
current expectations and projections about future events, our assumptions, and our knowledge of facts when the statements are made. These
statements, by their nature, involve substantial risks and uncertainties, sure of which are beyond our control, and actual results may
differ materially depending on various important factors. Risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial performance to differ
materially from our goals, plans, expectations, and projections expressed in forward-looking statements include those outlined in our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“S.E.C.”), including Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report of
Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Company does not
undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements
are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. It would be best to consider any forward-looking statements in light of
this explanation, and we caution you about relying on them.
General
Overview
Sparta
Commercial Services, Inc. (“Sparta,” “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation
with headquarters in New York City,
www.spartacommercial.com . We are a multi-disciplined parent corporation operating across three
business sectors – Financial Services, E-Commerce & Mobile Technology, and Health and Wellness ( www.spartacommercial.com ).
Sparta’s
roots are in the Powersports industry. The Company provided retail installment loans and leases through authorized motorcycle dealerships
in 33 states, with financing provided by institutional lenders. The Company also maintained a full underwriting and servicing platform
for its portfolio. Notwithstanding the discontinuance of our initial focus on consumer loans and leases post Lehman and during the 2008
financial crisis, in 2007, the Company introduced a new initiative, Municipal Financing ( www.spartamunicipal.com ), which has financed
over 100 jurisdictions to date. Sparta’s Municipal Finance program is available to all nonprofit organizations, institutions, and
entities. All nonprofit organizations which adhere to I.R.S. guidelines, including 501 (c) 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible.
Both public nonprofits, also known as public charities supported with publicly collected funds, and private nonprofits, also known as
private foundations backed by an individual or business entity, qualify for the program.
17
Consumers,
retailers, municipals, nonprofits, auction houses, banks, and insurance companies scrutinize title history reports for the vital information
needed and factored into crucial business decisions affecting the bottom line. Vehicle History Reports are a staple of Sparta’s
E-Commerce Technology subsidiary iMobile Solutions, Inc. Whether a vehicle is intended for business or recreational use, Sparta’s
Vehicle History Reports are highly regarded for accuracy and completeness. They have been sold across all 50 states and in 62 countries
worldwide. They provide a trusted layer of assurance to vehicle buyers and are available on our websites as well as on various dealership
websites. They include Cyclechex (Motorcycle History Reports at www.cyclechex.com), RVchex (Recreational Vehicle History Reports at
www.rvchex.com ),
and Truckchex (Heavy Duty Truck History Reports at
www.truckchex.com ).
The
Company’s E-Commerce and Mobile Technology subsidiary name change to iMobile Solutions, Inc., from Specialty Reports, Inc., in
2016, signifies its ever-broadening service offerings in the evolving technology landscape. With iMobile App ( www.imobileapp.com ),
the Company provides mobile technology services, including web and mobile application creation, development, and management for a wide
range of businesses to increase revenue, build brand recognition, and improve customer engagement. Our ever-broadening business base
of mobile applications includes vehicle dealerships and racetracks, private clubs and country clubs, schools and entertainment venues,
restaurants, grocery stores, and various other merchant types. ( www.imobileapp.com/app-gallery ). The Company also designs, launches,
maintains, and hosts websites for businesses incorporating SEO (search engine optimization), social media marketing, and online reviews
to improve their presence online.
We
provide specific, tailored action plans for our clients’ websites that include services such as eCommerce, CRM (Customer Relationship
Management) development, and integration. This custom software helps businesses communicate with customers and can also be used for employees
to communicate internally. The CRM software can be web-based, integrated with a mobile app, or both. We work with clients to understand
their unique needs and incorporate the features and requirements that are most important to them and will facilitate their business growth
and success. Correspondingly, the Company designs and builds custom kitchen ordering software for independent grocery stores, delicatessens,
and other food service businesses. The software can be designed in various ways, including mobile devices and in-store ordering. The
kitchen ordering software is enabled with payment integration, text messaging notification, wireless printing, and other features. iMobile
Solutions, Inc. provides a turn-key solution for businesses looking to simplify or streamline their kitchen ordering process. Additionally,
we offer text messaging services, which supplement business marketing strategies to gain and retain brand loyalty among its clients,
customers, and investors. Our text messaging platform allows clients to manage, schedule, and analyze text message performance quickly.
Sparta
created its subsidiary, New World Health Brands, Inc., in April 2019, on the heels of the Agriculture Improvement Act (also known as
the Farm Bill), signed into law last December 20, 2018. Consequently, hemp (CBD) was removed from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances
Act. Company management recognized the substantial business opportunity in the rapidly expanding hemp-CBD (cannabidiol) market in the
United States. During 2019-2020, we sourced, developed, and tested 5 CBD product categories totaling 31 products. We procured premium,
domestic-grade, full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and THC-free hemp, created product packaging and labeling, and implemented fulfillment
to launch an online Business-to-Consumer website:
www.newworldhealthcbd.com
on December 21, 2019.
18
Sparta’s
response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 quickly took shape with thorough investigations into evolving customer trends
in health and wellness. As a result, we expanded New World Health Brands and developed a new product line of natural dietary supplements.
In August 2020, we launched an online B to C website:
www.newworldhealthbrands.com , featuring high-quality nutritional supplements,
including vitamins and minerals, such as Zinc, Magnesium, Boron, Iodine, Beetroot Extract, Selenium, Vitamin B Complex, Vitamin C and
PQQ. To ensure the safety and quality of our products, all health and wellness offerings are exclusively sourced and manufactured in
the United States and adhere to strict U.S. standards and guidelines. Sparta’s commitment to high standards and transparency is
tantamount to being a trusted brand.
Sparta’s subsidiary, Sparta Crypto, Inc., www.SpartaCrypto.com,
was established on September 25, 2020, and is in the process of completing a proprietary state-of-the-art platform designed to connect
users of widely adopted digital currencies with sellers of various goods and services. The platform has not launched and the Company can
make no assurances that the described plan will reach implementation. In addition, the Company has completed and tested a cryptocurrency
payment gateway called SpartaPayIQ,
www.SpartaPayIQ.com , which is functional and was formally announced on March 3, 2022.
Agoge Global USA, Inc. was formed as a subsidiary
of Sparta Crypto, Inc. in December 2022 and entered in to a Joint Venture Agreement with WeDev Group to facilitate cross-border transactions
between importers and exporters of goods from the U.S. and Brazil. In addition, Agoge Global USA provides business intermediary services
to global importers and exporters of goods and services. These services include, but are not limited to, industry introductions, tax
compliance assistance, import and export documentation assistance, reselling services in other jurisdictions, and facilitation of cross-border
transactions.
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
Comparison
of the nine Months Ended January 31, 2023, and 2023
For
the nine months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, we have generated limited sales revenues, incurred significant expenses, and sustained
substantial operating losses.
Revenues
Revenues
totaled $189,042 during the nine months ending January 31, 2023, compared to $187,103 during the nine months ending January 31, 2022.
Revenues from information technology and sales of New World Health Products remain on the same level for both periods.
Cost
of Revenue
The
revenue consists of costs and fees paid to third parties to construct and maintain mobile apps and payments for subscription services
related to vehicle history reports and the cost of goods purchased for New World Health Brand products. The cost of revenue was $31,987
during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $32,551 during the nine months ended January 31, 2022. This $562, or a 2%
decline, was due to the cost of New World Health Brands’ product line inventory purchases being slightly lower than the previous
period.
Operating
Expenses
Operating
expenses were $1,239,451 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $847,017 during the nine months ended January 31,
2022, an increase of $392,434 or 46%, primarily due to increased legal and professional fees and stock-based compensation in the
current period. General office expenses increased by $62,268 was due mainly to software development cost for the new business venture
in Sparta Crypto $41,183
Expenses

Other
(income) expense
Other
income is comprised primarily of writing off some convertible notes of $625,064, which were expired and no longer an obligation for the
company and offset by gain in valuation in fair value of our derivative liabilities of $5,044,879. In the previous year, there was no
debt forgiveness, and a loss on the change in fair value of our derivative liabilities was $5,911,356. The significant change in value
of derivative liabilities primarily due to lower value of stock prices and the write off of the expired convertible notes.
Net
income (loss)
Our
net income attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, was $4,536,254 compared to a net loss of $6,836,851
for the nine months ended January 31, 2022, primarily due to the change in valuation of derivative liabilities $5,044,878 for this period
as compared to nine months ending January 31, 2022, we have a loss in valuation in fair value of derivative liabilities of $5,990,400.
LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As
of January 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $69,448,432, a decreased of $3,105,912 compared to the fiscal year-end April 30,
2022, primarily due to the recognition of other income posted during the nine months ending January 31, 2023, as explained above.
The
net cash flow used by operations was $1,047,550 for the nine months ending January 31, 2023. This deficit results primarily from our net
income of $4,546,048 offset by a net gain in fair value valuation of derivative liabilities of $5,044,878, write-off of promissory notes
of $936,600 and increased accounts payable and accrued expense decreased by $78,215.
We
met our cash requirements during the period through proceeds from the issuance of stock for a total of $135,000 and a bank overdraft
of $13,895. We also have converted a net total of $623,930 of Promissory notes to equity.
We
anticipate minimal research and development expenditures or expect the sale or acquisition of any significant property, plant, or
equipment during the next twelve months. On January 31, 2023, we had five full-time employees, three part-time employees, and one
intern. If we fully implement our business plan, our employment base may increase during the next twelve months. As we continue to
expand, we will incur additional costs for personnel. This potential increase in personnel is dependent upon our generating
increased revenues and obtaining sources of financing. We are still determining if we will successfully raise the necessary funds or
generate revenues sufficient to fund the potential increase in the number of employees. A union does not represent our
employees.
While
we have raised capital to meet our working capital and financing needs in the past, additional financing is required to meet our current
and potential future cash flow deficits from operations.
20
We
continue to seek additional financing, whether in the form of senior debt, subordinated debt, or equity. We currently have no commitments
for financing that are not at the investor’s election. There is no guarantee that we will successfully raise funds required to
support our operations.
We
will need approximately $1,000,000 in addition to our normal operating cash flow to conduct operations during the next twelve months.
However, there can be no assurance that additional private or public financing, including debt or equity financing, will be available
as needed or, if available, on terms favorable to us. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders. Such additional
equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges that are senior to those of our existing common or preferred stock. Furthermore,
if available, debt financing will require the payment of interest. However, it may involve restrictive covenants limiting our operating
flexibility if we cannot generate sufficient liquidity from operations or raise enough capital resources on acceptable terms. In that
case, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. We must adjust
our planned operations and development on a more limited scale.
The
effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant. Our operations are located in North America, and no seasonal
aspects would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
GOING
CONCERN ISSUES
The
Company’s historical losses and the lack of revenues raise substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. We cannot assure that our business operations will develop and provide us with significant cash to continue operations.
If we cannot build our business, we have to discontinue operations or cease to exist, which would be detrimental to the value of the
Company’s common stock.
To
improve the Company’s liquidity, the Company’s management is actively pursuing additional financing through discussions with
investment bankers, financial institutions, and private investors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its
effort to secure additional financing.
We
continue to experience net operating losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to develop profitable
operations. We are devoting all our efforts to growing our business and raising capital. Our net operating losses increase the difficulty
in meeting such goals, and there can be no assurance that such methods will prove successful.
The
primary issues management will focus on in the immediate future include: seeking additional credit facilities from institutional lenders,
institutional investors for debt or equity investments in our Company, short-term interim debt financing: and private placements of debt
and equity securities with accredited investors.
To
address these issues, we have engaged a financial advisory firm to advise and assist us in negotiating and raising capital.
INFLATION
The
impact of inflation on the costs of the Company and the ability to pass on cost increases to its customers over time is dependent upon
market conditions. The Company is not aware of any inflationary pressures that have had any significant impact on the Company’s
operations over the past quarter, and the Company does not anticipate that inflationary factors will have a substantial effect on future
operations.
21
OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The
Company does not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements or participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting
treatment.
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. While several significant
accounting policies affect our financial statements, the following critical accounting policy involves the most complex, difficult, and
subjective estimates and judgments.
Revenue
Recognition
During
the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the cumulative-effect
method. The new standard requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The adoption did
not impact our consolidated financial statements other than the enhancement of our disclosures related to our revenue-generating activities.
The
Company acts as a principal in its revenue transactions as it is the primary obligor.
Revenues
from mobile app products and New World Health Brands products are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenues from History Reports are
generally recognized upon delivery/download. Prepayments received from customers before delivery (if any) are recognized as deferred
revenue and recognized upon delivery. The Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due before our performance,
including refundable amounts.
Information
Technology:
The
Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria have been met:
●
Persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists.
●
No
significant Company obligations remain.
●
Collection
of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
●
The
fees are fixed or determinable.

Prepayments received from customers before delivery (if any) are recognized as deferred revenue and recognized upon delivery.
New
World Health Brands:
Revenues

22
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification Topic 718
(“ASC 718-10”), which
records compensation expense on a straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period of three to five years.
ASC
718-10 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using an option-pricing model. The
value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in
the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company is using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as its method of
valuation for share-based awards. The Company’s determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant
using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding several highly complex
and subjective variables. These variables include but are not limited to the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the
awards term and other market variables, such as the risk-free interest rate.
Inventories
Inventory
comprises finished goods for the Company’s New World Health Brands business. The Company’s inventories represent finished
goods, consisting of products available for sale. They are accounted for using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and valued at the
lower cost or net realizable value.
Convertible
Instruments
The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with professional standards
for “ Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ” (“ASC 815-40”).
ASC
815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity’s control and could or require net cash
settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability. The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when
it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional
standards when “ Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features ,” as those professional
standards pertain to “ Certain Convertible Instruments .” Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts
to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based on the differences between the
fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded
in the note. The Company also records, when necessary, deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred
shares based upon the differences between the underlying common stock’s fair value at the note transaction’s commitment date
and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related
debt to their earliest redemption date.
Derivative
Liabilities
ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and
account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and
risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported
in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered
a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument
is deemed conventional, as described.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023. Based
on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls,
the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2022, using the criteria established
in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on
a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
that is less severe than a material weakness yet necessary enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the Company’s
financial reporting. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2022, we determined
that control deficiencies existed that constituted material weaknesses, as described below:
●
lack of documented policies and procedures;
●
we have no audit committee;
●
there is a risk of management override, given that our officers have a high degree of involvement in our day-to-day operations;
●
there is no effective separation of duties, which includes monitoring controls, between the members of management.
24
Due
to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. As a result,
we have been unable to improve our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ending April 30, 2022. However, to the
extent possible, we will implement procedures to ensure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets, and the recording
of transactions will be performed by separate individuals. Management is currently evaluating the steps to address these material weaknesses.
Accordingly,
these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls.
As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
In
light of these significant deficiencies, we performed additional analyses and procedures to conclude that our consolidated financial
statements for the year ended April 30, 2022, included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, were fairly stated in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our significant deficiency, our consolidated financial statements for the nine months
ended January 31, 2023, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit a smaller reporting company to provide only management’s
report in its annual report.
PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
As
of January 31, 2023, we have not been named as parties to any further legal proceedings except those disclosed prior and updated below.
From time to time, we may become involved in other legal proceedings, which sometimes arise due to the very nature of and in the ordinary
course of this business.
By
way of background, the Company had received notices dated April 1, 2016, May 13, 2016, and July 22, 2016, from two lenders claiming defaults
relating to conversion requests of $8,365.00 in principal plus interest, attorney fees, and $5,000.00 in principal plus interest also
seeking stock conversions aside from the stated principal and interest concerning notes in the total amounts of $55,125.00 and $27,500.00,
respectively, which the Company has declined to process and believes it has valid, meritorious defenses in that regard. The Company believes
these claims are contingent and unliquidated and disputes the same. While there can be no assurances that the Company would prevail in
any potential litigation concerning allegations brought against the Company, these potential liabilities have been recorded in the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements.
Concerning
the above claims, on September 22, 2016, a motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint was filed in the Supreme Court in the
State of New York: County of Kings against the Company by a lender for the amount of $102,170.82 in principal and stock conversion
interest, plus fees and costs. Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint was denied on May 5, 2017. On
August 22, 2018, Plaintiff brought a second motion seeking summary judgment on the liability issue, again denied by the Court on
March 14, 2019. The most recent appearance in this matter had been scheduled for March 13, 2020, at which time the Court marked the
case “adjourned without a date” due to the restrictions imposed on the Courts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. To
date, no further Court appearances have been scheduled in this matter. However, most notably, a favorable decision from the New York
State Court of Appeals regarding the same types of transactions has since been determined to be criminally usurious and, therefore,
unenforceable management believes. These were the very same defenses raised on behalf of the Company.

On
October 26, 2018, a second lender commenced an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York: New York County alleging damages
from unpaid principal arising from a promissory note dated February 26, 2015, in the amount of $50,000.00 plus damages including interest
and stock conversions, costs and fees. The Company disputes the enforceability of such claims for similar reasons, as stated above, based
on the Court of Appeals ruling regarding the unenforceable nature of such claims demanding usurious interest rates. On November 9, 2022
the court rendered a decision on the cross motions for summary judgment in favor of the Company granting full dismissal of all causes
of action and awarded costs in favor of the Company. The time within which for plaintiff to appeal the decision has since expired.
