Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022   NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2009, and its year-end is June 30. The Company’s principle executive office address is 999 N Northlake Way Ste 203, Seattle, Washington 98103-3442.   The Company had previously acquired mineral properties located in the Thunder Bay mining district, Province of Ontario, Canada but never determined whether these properties contain reserves that are economically recoverable. As of June 30, 2015, the Company ceased our exploration operations in the Thunder Bay mining district due to a lack of funds. As of September 30, 2018, the Company ceased pursing all mining exploration.   The Company acquired the Within / Without Granola (“WWG”) brand on July 15, 2021 form Paleo Scavenger, LLC for $ 10,000 . During June 2022, the Company restarted the manufacturing process for the Within / Without Granola products. The Company generated the first sales since inception during August 2022. The Company is currently selling the original and maple flavors granola products on Shopify. In addition, the Company is in the process of qualifying to sell its products on Amazon.   NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) for interim financial information applicable for a going concern, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of the business, and in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Certain information and disclosures included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.   In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented.   The results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. These unaudited financial statements and related footnotes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2022.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company provides estimates for its common stock valuations and valuation allowances for deferred taxes.   Cash Flow Reporting   The Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022.   The Company maintains its cash balance at one financial institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.     8 Table of Contents   Accounts Receivable   Accounts receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on historical collection data and current franchisee information. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. At December 31, 2022, no allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary. The accounts receivable balance was $ 848
and $- 0 - at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.   Inventory   Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (FIFO: first-in, first-out) or market. The cost of inventory includes the cost of raw materials and freight. During June 2022 the Company purchased its first inventory of the original and maple flavored products for $ 16,449 . At June 30, 2022, it was determined the fair value of the inventory was overstated and the Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 8,225
at June 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company’s inventory was $ 2,541
and $ 8,224 , respectively.   Basic Earnings (loss) per Share   The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,
Earnings per Share.
ASC 260 specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock.   Basic net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.   Share Based Compensation   The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 718 and No. 505. The Company issues restricted stock to employees and consultants for their services. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the date of grant. These shares are considered fully vested and the fair market value is recognized as expense in the period granted. The Company recognized consulting expenses and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital related to stock issued for services. For agreements requiring future services, the consulting expense is to be recognized ratably over the requisite service period. Stock based compensation amounted to $ 525
and $ 560
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 1,330
and $ 980
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Fair Value Measurements   In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820 which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of ASC 820 were effective January 1, 2008.   As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observations of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).   The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:   Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives, marketable securities and listed equities.   Level 2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, options and collars.   Level 3 – Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.   The Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be adjusted on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with ASC 825-10 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.     9 Table of Contents   Income Taxes   The Company’s policy is to provide for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) legislation reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to
21.0 % and is effective June 22, 2018 for the Company. We did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carryforward period.   The Company intends to file income tax returns in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction and various state tax jurisdictions. The tax years for 2010 to 2018 remain open for examination by federal and/or state tax jurisdictions. The Company is currently not under examination by any other tax jurisdictions for any tax year.   Going Concern   These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $ 19,241,768
at December 31, 2022 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.   There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through any type of offering.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards   There have been no new accounting pronouncements during the year ended December 31, 2022 that we believe would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.   NOTE 3 ACQUISITIION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   On July 15, 2021, the Company acquired the assets of Paleo Scavenger, LLC (Paleo) for $ 10,000 . Paleo owns the Within / Without Granola (“WWG”) brand. The purchase price includes the WWG trademarks, brands, books, records, intellectual property, commercial sales channel, customer lists and manufacturing rights. WWG ceased operations in early 2021. The Company restated operation in June 2022 and reported the first sale of the granola products during August 2022.   The purchase price has been allocated to the net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values as follows:   WWG Trademark     1,000   Commercial Sales Channel     2,000   Customer List     5,000   Other Intellectual Property     2,000             Total   $ 10,000     The fair value of the Intangible assets: commercial sales channel, customer list and other intangible assets was calculated using the net present value of the projected gross profit to be generated over the next 36 months beginning on July 15, 2021 with quarterly amortization of $ 750 . The WWG Trademark was deemed to have an indefinite life and will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis. Amortization expense amounted to $ 750
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and $ 1,500
and $ 1,375
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the accompanying statements of operations.   Proforma information has not been presented as it has been deemed immaterial.     10 Table of Contents   NOTE 4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   On February 1, 2015, the Company entered into a
24 -month consulting agreement extension with William Drury, an Officer of the Company and WICAWIBE LLC. Prior to subsequent termination, the agreement was to expire on January 31, 2017 and the monthly fee was $ 15,000 . On September 28, 2016, Mr. Drury resigned as President and Treasurer of the Company. On September 29, 2016, a settlement agreement between Mr. Drury and the Company was signed which provides a payment of $ 50,000
in cash and $ 50,000
in the Company’s common stock to release the Company from all possible claims of accrued salary, independent contractor fees, expense and cost owed to Mr. Drury and terminate the consulting agreement which was scheduled to expire on
January 31, 2017 . On October 2, 2016, Mr. Drury resigned as director and the Company accepted his resignation and ratified the settlement agreement dated September 29, 2016. According to the settlement agreement, $ 46,500
was paid directly to Mr. Drury on October 5, 2016 and the remaining $ 3,500  paid directly to an attorney for the legal fees related to the settlement agreement. The shares of the Company’s common stock are issuable to Mr. Drury in increments of
3,571
shares. Mr. Drury will continue to be issued 3,571 until he is able to garner $ 50,000
by selling the shares in the over-the-counter market or an exchange (as defined under the securities act of 1933, as amended). On October 24, 2016, the Company issued
14,286
shares of the Company’s common stock to Mr. Drury to partially settle the $ 50,000
common stock obligation. Those shares had a fair value of $ 3,200
at the date of issuance. This liability represents an unconditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares for a fixed monetary amount. The fair value of the shares issued to Mr. Drury but not yet sold are netted against the liability in the balance sheet. Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of the shares issued but not sold are recognized as an adjustment to the net liability and other income/expense until such time as the shares are sold. Mr. Drury has not sold these shares as of December 31, 2022. The Company recognized other income (expense) due to the marking of these shares to fair value subsequent to issuance of recognized $- 0 - and ($ 2,668 ) for three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 15
and ($ 129 ) for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the accompanying statements of operations.   Since September 2016, the Company’s President, Amber Finney, advanced the Company $ 165,666
as a related party loan. The proceeds for these loans were used for working capital. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there are related party loans totaling $ 165,666
and $ 154,216 , respectively. These advances are unsecured, due on demand and carry no interest or collateral.   The officers of the Company could become involved in other business activities as they become available. This could create a conflict between the Company and the other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such a conflict should one arise.   NOTE 5 EQUITY TRANSACTIONS   On September 19, 2016, the shareholders of Company approved an increase to the number of authorized shares from
256,000,000
shares to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and added
25,000,000

During this period, the Company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events.     11 Table of Contents   ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial statements of Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information and the June 30, 2022 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Form 10-K (File No. 000-54838; the “Form 10-K”), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2022. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute “forward-looking” statements.   OVERVIEW   The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2009 and has established a fiscal year end of June 30.   Going Concern   To date the Company has little operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. The Company has incurred a loss since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $19,241,768 at December 31, 2022 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.    The Company plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through this or any other offerings. The Company is optimistic about the Within / Without Granola (“WWG”) brand will generate cash in the next year.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Financial Notes.   PLAN OF OPERATION   Our plan of operation for the following twelve months is as follows:   On July 15, 2021, we acquired the assets of Paleo Scavenger, LLC for $10,000. Paleo owns the Within / Without Granola (“WWG”) brand. The purchase price includes the WWG trademarks, brands, books, records, intellectual property, commercial sales channel, customer lists and manufacturing rights. Early in 2021, WWG ceased operations and we restarted the manufacturing process in June 2022.   We generated our first sales since inception during August 2022. We are currently selling our original and maple flavored granola products on Shopify. In addition, we are in the process of qualifying to sell our products on Amazon.   We must raise at least $100,000 to commence our plan of operation, described above, and fund our ongoing operational expenses. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue our operations. Management believes that if we are successful in raising $100,000, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, if such financing is not available, we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.   If we are unsuccessful in raising at least $100,000 through a private placement, we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new, development stage business to obtain. Therefore, the Company is highly dependent upon the success of an anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with little in the way of operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. If and when these funds are obtained, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing, we would be required to cease business operations and as a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment.   Results of Operations for the Three months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021   Overview.
Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. is a Nevada corporation, originally formed on September 19, 2009. We are attempting to restart the Within / Without Granola (“WWG”) brand acquired on July 15, 2021.
