Reservoir Media, Inc. (formerly known as Roth CH Acquisition II Co. (“ ROCC ”)), a Delaware corporation (the “ Company ”), is an independent music company based in New York City, New York and with offices in Los Angeles, Nashville, Toronto, London and Abu Dhabi. On July 28, 2021 (the “ Closing Date ”), ROCC consummated the acquisition of Reservoir Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ RHI ”), pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of April 14, 2021 (the “ Merger Agreement ”), by and among ROCC, Roth CH II Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ROCC (“ Merger Sub ”), and RHI. On the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into RHI, with RHI surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ROCC (the “ Business Combination ”). In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, “Roth CH Acquisition II Co.” was renamed “Reservoir Media, Inc.” effective as of the Closing Date. The common stock, $ 0.0001
par value per share, of the Company (the “ Common Stock ”) and warrants are traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“ NASDAQ ”) under the ticker symbols “RSVR” and “RSVRW,” respectively. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with RHI determined to be the accounting acquirer and the Company as the acquired company for accounting purposes. All historical financial information presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements represents the accounts of RHI and its consolidated subsidiaries as if RHI is the predecessor to the Company. See Note 4, “ Business Combination and PIPE Investment ” for additional information with respect to the Business Combination and related transactions. The Company’s activities are organized into
two
operating segments: Music Publishing and Recorded Music. Operations of the Music Publishing segment involve the acquisition of interests in music catalogs from which royalties are earned as well as signing songwriters to exclusive agreements which give the Company an interest in the future delivery of songs. The publishing catalog includes ownership or control rights to more than
140,000
musical compositions that span across historic pieces, motion picture scores and current award-winning hits. Operations of the Recorded Music segment involve the acquisition of sound recording catalogs as well as the discovery and development of recording artists and the marketing, distribution, sale and licensing of the music catalog. The Recorded Music operations are primarily conducted through the Chrysalis Records platform and Tommy Boy Music, LLC (“ Tommy Boy ”), acquired in June 2021, and include the ownership of over
36,000
sound recordings. See Note 6, “ Acquisitions ” for additional information with respect to the Tommy Boy acquisition. COVID-19 Pandemic In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the coronavirus (“ COVID-19 ”) as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. Government-imposed restrictions and general behavioral changes in response to the pandemic adversely affected the Company’s results of operations for the three and nine months ended December  31, 2022 and 2021. This included performance revenue generated from retail, restaurants, bars, gyms and live shows, synchronization revenue, and the release schedule of physical product. Even as government restrictions are lifted and consumer behavior starts to return to pre-pandemic norms, it is unclear for how long and to what extent the Company’s operations will continue to be affected. Although the Company has not made material changes to any estimates or judgments that impact its consolidated financial statements as a result of COVID-19, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Future developments surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect the Company’s operating results, including reductions in revenue and cash flow and could impact the Company’s impairment assessments of accounts receivable or intangible assets, which may be material to our consolidated financial statements. 6
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its majority-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) for interim financial information. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in these condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain information and note disclosures typically included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“ US GAAP ”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. The condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2022, included herein, was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures, including certain notes required by US GAAP on an annual reporting basis. In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. The results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter, the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 or any other period. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining useful lives of intangible assets, intangible asset recoverability and impairment and accrued revenue. Actual results could differ from these estimates. NOTE 3.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ ASU ”) 2016-03, “ Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ” (“ ASU 2016-03 ”), which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current US GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses. Subsequent to ASU 2016-03, the FASB has issued several related ASUs amending the original ASU 2016-03. The updates are intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. For public entities, ASU 2016-03 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that annual reporting period. For the Company, ASU 2016-03 is effective beginning April 1, 2023, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-03 will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 7
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ In April 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “ Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) ” (“ ASU 2020-04 ”), which provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting; particularly as it relates to the risk of cessation of LIBOR. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 apply only to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, “ Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 ” (“ ASU 2022-06 ”) which deferred the sunset date of ASU 2020-04.  Following the issuance of ASU 2022-06, the expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2024, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. As discussed in Note 9 “ Secured Line of Credit ” the Senior Credit Facility was amended on December 16, 2022, including the modification of the indexed interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR effective on the amendment date.  Additionally, in January 2023, RMM modified its outstanding interest rate swaps to replace the floating rate interest payments received from the counterparty based on LIBOR to floating rate interest payments received from the counterparty based on SOFR, with corresponding adjustments to the fixed rates paid by RMM.  Consequently, ASU 2020-04 will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Recently Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “ Leases (Topic 842) ” (“ ASU 2016-02 ”), which established a new ASC Topic 842, “ Leases ” (“ ASC 842 ”) that introduced a right-of-use (“ ROU ”) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of income. The Company adopted the new standard beginning April 1, 2022 (the “ effective date ”), using a modified retrospective transition approach with application as of the effective date as the date of initial application without restating comparative period financial statements. The new guidance also provides several practical expedients and policies that companies may elect. The Company elected the package of practical expedients under which it did not reassess the classification of its existing leases, reevaluate whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases or reassess initial direct costs under the new guidance. Rather, the Company retained the conclusions reached for these items under ASC Topic 840,
Leases . Additionally, the Company elected a practical expedient to not separate non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, from lease components. The Company did not elect the practical expedient that permits a reassessment of lease terms for existing leases. Upon its transition to the new guidance, the Company recognized approximately $ 2.1
million of operating lease liabilities and corresponding ROU assets. As the rates implicit in the Company’s leases are not readily determinable, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the effective date to determine the present value of lease payments. This rate is based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on the amount or timing of the Company’s cash flows or liquidity. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “ Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ” (“ ASU 2019-12 ”). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on April 1, 2022 and this adoption did not have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements or the Company’s disclosures. ​ 8
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ NOTE 4. BUSINESS COMBINATION AND PIPE INVESTMENT As discussed in Note 1, “ Description of Business ,” on the Closing Date, the Company consummated the Business Combination pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with US GAAP, primarily because former shareholders of RHI continue to control the Company upon closing of the Business Combination. Under this method of accounting, the Company is treated as the “acquired” company for accounting purposes and the Business Combination is treated as the equivalent of RHI issuing stock for the net assets of the Company, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of the Company are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or intangible assets recorded. In addition, all historical financial information presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements represents the accounts of RHI and its consolidated subsidiaries as if RHI is the predecessor to the Company.
Immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, each share of Series A preferred stock, par value $ 0.00001
per share, of RHI (the “ RHI Preferred Stock ”) that was issued and outstanding was automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock, par value $ 0.00001
per share, of RHI (the “ RHI Common Stock ”) at the then-effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant RHI’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “ RHI Preferred Stock Conversion ”). Additionally, each share of RHI Common Stock (including the RHI Common Stock resulting from the RHI Preferred Stock Conversion) that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination was canceled and converted into the right to receive
196.06562028646
(the “ Exchange Ratio ”) shares of Common Stock. Furthermore, each option to acquire a share of RHI Common Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination became fully vested in accordance with the original terms of the awards and was converted into an option to purchase shares of Common Stock (each option, an “ RMI Exchanged Option ”), with the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the options and exercise price of each RMI Exchanged Option adjusted commensurately with the Exchange Ratio. In connection with the Business Combination, ROCC entered into subscription agreements with certain accredited investors (the “ PIPE Investors ”), pursuant to which ROCC issued
15,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share, of ROCC (the “ ROCC Common Stock ”) at a purchase price of $ 10.00
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $ 150.0
million (the “ PIPE Investment ”). ROCC consummated the PIPE Investment immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. Approximately $ 20,900,000
of transaction fees and expenses were incurred in connection with the closing of the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment, which have been accounted for as a reduction in proceeds. A portion of the proceeds from the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment was used to pay transaction fees and expenses, and approximately $ 81,300,000
was used to retire the Tommy Boy Related Party Notes (as defined below) and related accrued interest, repay the secured loan outstanding in an amount of $ 18,250,000
and make a payment totaling $ 36,750,000
on the secured line of credit in connection with a refinancing of the Previous Credit Facilities. See Note 9, “ Secured Line of Credit ” for additional information with respect to the Company’s financing arrangements.
On the Closing Date, the Company also amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to adjust the number of its authorized shares of capital stock to
750,000,000
shares of Common Stock and
75,000,000
shares of preferred stock. ​ 9
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ NOTE 5. REVENUE RECOGNITION For the Company’s operating segments, Music Publishing and Recorded Music, the Company accounts for a contract when it has legally enforceable rights and obligations and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company identifies the performance obligations and determines the transaction price associated with the contract. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of the promised services or goods is transferred to the Company’s customers, and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company is contractually due in exchange for those services or goods. Certain of the Company’s arrangements include licenses of intellectual property with consideration in the form of sales- and usage-based royalties. Royalty revenue is recognized when the subsequent sale or usage occurs using the best estimates available of the amounts that will be received by the Company. The Company recognized revenue of $ 3,478,970
and $ 1,210,132
from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods is impacted by an updated estimate of Music Publishing royalties based on the Company’s current estimate of effects arising from the July 2022 ruling by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board (the “ CRB ”) to affirm increases to the statutory royalty rate structure for mechanical royalties in the U.S. for the period 2018 to 2022.  For much of the period between 2018 and 2022, most digital service providers have accounted and submitted payment to the Company using the applicable 2017 rate while the remand process took place. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company’s revenue consisted of the following categories during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended December 31,  ​ Nine Months Ended December 31,  ​      2022      2021      2022      2021 Revenue by Type ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Digital ​ $

During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company completed such acquisitions totaling $ 36,264,222
and $ 159,003,542 , respectively, inclusive of deferred acquisition payments. The Company did not complete any individually significant acquisition transactions during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. On June 2, 2021, the Company acquired U.S. based record label and music publishing company Tommy Boy for approximately $ 100
million, which was the most significant acquisition transaction during the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Two
members of the Company’s board of directors (the “ Board ”) were also members of Tommy Boy’s board of managers and had an equity interest in both companies. The acquisition of Tommy Boy was accounted for as an asset acquisition as a result of the significant concentration of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a recorded music catalog intangible asset (weighted average useful life of
30 years ). ​ 11

7.50 :1.00 (net of up to $ 20,000,000
of certain cash balances) as of the end of each fiscal quarter, (vi) reduce the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant to
1.10 :1.00 and (vii) modify the consolidated senior debt to library value ratio financial covenant to
0.450 , subject to certain adjustments. In connection with the Second Amendment, RMM recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $ 914,000
that reflects the write-off of a portion of unamortized previous debt issuance costs and capitalized approximately $ 3,500,000
in new debt issuance costs. RMM is required to pay an unused fee in respect of unused commitments under the Senior Credit Facility, if any, at a rate of
0.25 % per annum. Substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the Company, RHI, RMM and the other subsidiary guarantors are pledged as collateral to secure the obligations of RMM under the RMM Credit Agreement. The RMM Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting the ability of the Company, RHI, RMM and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt or liens, merge or consolidate with others, make investments, make cash dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock, dispose of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates or enter into certain restrictive agreements. In addition, the Company, on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries, must comply with financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than
1.10 :1.00 for each four fiscal quarter period, and (ii) a consolidated senior debt to library value ratio of
0.45 :1.00, subject to certain adjustments. If RMM does not comply with the covenants in the RMM Credit Agreement, the lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility also includes an “accordion feature” that permits RMM to seek additional commitments in an amount not to exceed $ 150,000,000
that would increase the Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, the Senior Credit Facility had a borrowing capacity of $ 450,000,000 , with remaining borrowing availability of $ 151,171,591 . Interest Rate Swaps At December 31, 2022, RMM had the following interest rate swaps outstanding, under which it pays a fixed rate and receives a floating interest payment from the counterparty based on LIBOR with reference to notional amounts adjusted to match the original scheduled principal repayments pursuant to the indenture agreement: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Notional       ​      ​ ​ ​ Amount at  ​ Pay  ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31,  ​ Fixed  ​ ​ Effective Date ​ 2022 ​ Rate ​ Maturity March 10, 2022 ​ $

​ In January 2023, RMM modified these outstanding interest rate swaps to replace the floating rate interest payments received from the counterparty based on LIBOR to floating rate interest payments received from the counterparty based on SOFR, with corresponding adjustments to the fixed rates paid by RMM.  The change in the reference rate in these interest rate swaps from LIBOR to SOFR did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 13
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ On March 10, 2022, two previous interest rate swaps expired with original notional amounts of $ 40,228,152
and $ 59,325,388 . Through the expiration date of these previous interest rate swaps, RMM paid fixed rates of
2.812 % and
2.972 %, respectively, to the counterparty and received a floating interest payment from the counterparty based on LIBOR with reference to notional amounts adjusted to match the original scheduled principal repayments pursuant to the indenture agreement. NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 3,529,984

and $ 1,407,989 , respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company changed its estimate of the applicable tax rate used to measure its international deferred tax liabilities in the United Kingdom resulting in a significant increase in its effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. The increase of the estimate of the applicable future tax rate from
19 % to
25 % used to measure the international deferred tax liabilities in the United Kingdom resulted in incremental tax expense of $ 3,658,643
during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 due to the increase in the value of deferred tax liabilities. ​ ​ NOTE 11.

4.66 % per year and were payable upon the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination and December 21, 2021. The Tommy Boy Related Party Notes and accrued interest were paid on the Closing Date. See Note 4, “ Business Combination and PIPE Investment ” for additional information with respect to the consummation of the Business Combination. ​ NOTE 13. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY The condensed consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity reflect the reverse capitalization as of the Closing Date. Because RHI was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse capitalization with ROCC, all periods prior to the Closing Date reflect the balances and activity of RHI. The consolidated balances, share activity and per share amounts in these condensed consolidated statements of equity were retroactively adjusted, where applicable, using the Exchange Ratio. See Note 1, “ Description of Business ” and Note 4, “ Business Combination and PIPE Investment ” for additional information. 14
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ RHI Preferred Stock Prior to the Business Combination, RHI had
16,175,406
shares of RHI Preferred Stock outstanding. The RHI Preferred Stock was convertible into an equal number of shares of RHI Common Stock at the option of the preferred shareholder and was mandatorily converted into an equal number of shares of RHI Common Stock upon a qualified public offering of RHI Common Stock. Immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination, each share of RHI Preferred Stock that was issued and outstanding was automatically converted into a number of shares of RHI Common Stock pursuant to the RHI Preferred Stock Conversion. See Note 4, “ Business Combination and PIPE Investment ” for additional information with respect to the RHI Preferred Stock Conversion. While outstanding, the RHI Preferred Stock participated in dividends declared on common shares, if any, on the basis as if the shares of RHI Preferred Stock were converted into shares of RHI Common Stock. The Company did not declare any dividends subsequent to the issuance of RHI Preferred Stock through the RHI Preferred Stock Conversion. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had
no
shares of RHI Preferred Stock outstanding. Warrants As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s outstanding warrants included
5,750,000
publicly-traded warrants (the “ Public Warrants ”), which were issued during ROCC’s initial public offering on December 15, 2020, and
137,500
warrants sold in a private placement to ROCC’s sponsor (the “ Private Warrants ” and together with the Public Warrants, the “ Warrants ”), which were assumed by the Company in connection with the Business Combination and exchanged into warrants for shares of Common Stock. Each whole Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase
one
whole share of Common Stock at a price of $ 11.50
per share, provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a registered holder may exercise its Warrants only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. The Warrants will expire
five years
after the completion of the Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants in whole, but not in part, at a price of $ 0.01
per warrant upon a minimum of
30 days ’ prior written notice of redemption, if and only if the last sale price of Common Stock equals or exceeds $ 18.00
per share for any
20 -trading days within a
30 -trading day period ending
three
business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the registered holders. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrant exercise. The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Company evaluated the Warrants under ASC Topic 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
(“ ASC 480 ”) and ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging
(“ ASC 815 ”), and in accordance with its accounting policies, concluded they meet the criteria to be equity classified as they were determined to be indexed in the Company’s stock and meet the requirements for equity classification. ​ 15

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 2021 Incentive Plan On July 28, 2021, in connection with the Business Combination, the Company adopted the Reservoir Media, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “ 2021 Incentive Plan ”), which became effective on such date. In addition, pursuant to terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Business Combination, options previously granted under the Reservoir Holdings, Inc. 2019 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “ Previous RHI 2019 Incentive Plan ”) to purchase shares of RHI Common Stock were converted into options to purchase
1,494,848
shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2021 Incentive Plan. As of the effective date of the 2021 Incentive Plan, no further stock awards have been or will be granted under the Previous RHI 2019 Incentive Plan, and the Previous RHI 2019 Incentive Plan is no longer in effect. Share-based compensation expense totaled $ 791,187
($ 609,829 , net of taxes) and $ 1,208,685
($ 931,705 , net of taxes) during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Share-based compensation expense totaled $ 2,408,677

Share-based compensation expense is classified as “Administration expenses” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted restricted stock units (“ RSUs ”) to satisfy previous obligations to issue a variable number of equity awards based on a fixed monetary amount. Prior to the issuance of these RSUs, the Company classified these awards as liabilities. Upon issuance of the RSU’s the awards became equity-classified as they no longer met the criteria to be liability-classified and a liability of $ 1,106,429
was reclassified from accounts payable and accrued liabilities to additional paid-in capital. 16

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company is exposed to the following risks related to its financial instruments: (a) Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the possibility that the Company’s debtors may be unable to fulfill their financial obligations. Revenues earned from publishing and distribution companies are concentrated in the music and entertainment industry. The Company monitors its exposure to credit risk on a regular basis. 17
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ (b) Interest Rate Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its secured line of credit. As described in Note 9, “ Secured Line of Credit, ” the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to partially reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its Credit Facilities. The fair value of the outstanding interest rate swaps was a $ 8,315,009
asset as of December 31, 2022 and a $ 3,991,802
asset as of March 31, 2022. Fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, which are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. The change in the unrealized fair value of the swaps during the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $ 179,573
was recorded as a loss on changes in fair value of derivative instruments. The change in the unrealized fair value of the swaps during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $ 4,323,207
was recorded as a gain on changes in fair value of derivative instruments. The change in the unrealized fair value of the swaps during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 of $ 1,663,743
and $ 2,888,961 , respectively, was recorded as a gain on changes in fair value of derivative instruments. (c) Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk in fluctuations of currency rates on its revenue from royalties, writers’ fees and its subsidiaries’ operations. (d) Financial Instruments Financial instruments not described elsewhere include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and borrowings under its secured line of credit. The carrying values of these instruments as of December 31, 2022 do not differ materially from their respective fair values due to the immediate or short-term duration of these items or their bearing market-related rates of interest. NOTE 17. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS (a) Leases The Company leases its business premises under operating leases which have expiration dates between 2022 – 2033. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. Beginning April 1, 2022, the Company recognizes on the balance sheet a lease liability for its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and a corresponding ROU asset representing its right to use the underlying asset over the period of use based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term as of the lease commencement date in accordance with ASC 842.
Certain leases contain fixed rent escalations and/or renewal options. None of the Company’s operating leases include variable lease payments. Subsequent amortization of the ROU asset and accretion of the lease liability for an operating lease is recognized as a single lease cost, on a straight-line basis, over the lease term. Reductions of the ROU asset and the change in the lease liability are included in changes in Other assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company obtained right-of-use assets in exchange for new operating lease obligations totaling $ 5,789,681
and $ 6,146,064 , respectively, including a right-of-use asset totaling approximately $ 5.8
million in exchange for a new operating lease obligation for its new headquarter office facility consisting of
12,470
square feet of leased office space at 200 Varick Street, Suite 801A, New York, NY (the “ New HQ Lease ”). The total commitment under the New HQ Lease is approximately $ 8.4
million, which is payable monthly with escalating rental payments over a
130 -month lease term. 18
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ (b) Litigation The Company is subject to claims and contingencies in the normal course of business. To the extent the Company cannot predict the outcome of the claims and contingencies or estimate the amount of any loss that may result,
no
provision for any contingent liabilities has been made in the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that losses resulting from these matters, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. All such matters which the Company concludes are probable to result in a loss and for which management can reasonably estimate the amount of such loss have been accrued for within these condensed consolidated financial statements. NOTE 18. SEGMENT REPORTING The Company’s business is organized in
two
reportable segments: Music Publishing and Recorded Music. The Company identified its Chief Executive Officer as its Chief Operating Decision Maker (“ CODM ”). The Company’s CODM evaluates financial performance of its segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating income before depreciation and amortization (“ OIBDA ”). The accounting policies of the Company’s business segments are consistent with the Company’s policies for the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not have sales between segments. The following tables present total revenue and reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income by segment for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 ​ ​ Music  ​ Recorded  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Publishing      Music      Other      Consolidated Total revenue ​ $

24,446,258 (a) During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the Company revised the methodology it uses to allocate corporate general and administrative expenses to its operating segments to better align usage of corporate resources allocated to the Company segments. The updated allocation methodology had no impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. This change was applied retrospectively, and segment OIBDA for all comparative periods has been updated to reflect this change. ​ NOTE 19. CORRECTION OF PRIOR PERIOD ERRORS As previously disclosed in Note 19 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the Company identified prior period accounting errors that the Company has concluded are not material to the Company’s previously reported consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
Based on management’s evaluation of the accounting errors in consideration of the SEC Staff’s Accounting Bulletins Nos. 99 (“ SAB 99 ”) and 108 (“ SAB 108 ”) and interpretations therewith, the Company concluded the errors are not material, on an individual or aggregate basis, to the Company’s previously reported annual and interim consolidated financial statements affected by the errors, which includes the Company’s previously reported unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 (the “ previously reported financial statements ”).  However, the Company further concluded the accounting errors cannot be corrected as an out-of-period adjustment in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022, because to do so would cause a material misstatement in those financial statements.  Accordingly, the Company referred to the guidance prescribed by SAB 108 which specifies that the errors must be corrected the next time the previously reported financial statements are filed.  Therefore, the Company corrected the accounting errors in all of the Company’s previously reported annual and interim consolidated financial statements impacted by the errors, which includes the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. 20
Table of Contents RESERVOIR MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Unaudited) ​ The following is a description of the accounting errors and their impact on the Company’s previously reported financial statements: The Company identified certain accounting errors that originated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 related to the recognition of royalty revenue associated with royalties generated from the pre-acquisition usage of intellectual property rights that the Company acquired in certain of its music catalog acquisitions for which the Company was entitled to collect pre-acquisition royalties from the sellers for a specified period prior to the closing date of these acquisitions. The Company’s historical accounting practice with respect to pre-acquisition royalties was to recognize revenue upon closing of the acquisitions. Upon further review, the Company concluded that the pre-acquisition royalties should have been accounted for as reduction of the purchase price of the acquired music catalogs, as prescribed by ASC 805-50,

(“ ASC 805-50 ”) rather than recognized as revenue under ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ ASC 606 ”).
As part of its review, the Company further concluded that certain royalty revenue generated from pre-acquisition usage that remained uncollected at closing, as well as the related royalties due to certain artists or songwriters associated with each of the acquired music catalogs, should have been recognized as accounts receivable and royalties payable, respectively, on the closing date of the acquired music catalog based on the Company’s best estimate of the uncollected royalties due to the Company and payables due to the artists or songwriters on the closing date. The Company’s historical accounting practice associated with these uncollected royalties and royalties payable was to recognize the uncollected royalties as revenue under ASC 606 as they were collected after the closing date, and to recognize cost of revenue as the royalties due to the artists or songwriters when the related royalty revenue was collected. The Company also concluded that the acquired accounts receivable and royalties payable assumed on the date of closing should have been included in the purchase price allocation of the Company’s acquired music catalogs, as prescribed by ASC 805-50. The financial tables below present the impact of correcting the accounting errors on the Company’s previously reported financial statements.

Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of Reservoir Media, Inc.’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Reservoir Media, Inc.’s condensed consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “ Quarterly Report ”). Certain statements contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “ we ,” “ us ,” “ our, ” the “ Company ” and “ Reservoir ” refer collectively to Reservoir Media, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. As disclosed in Note 19, “ Correction of Prior Period Errors ” to our consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, have been revised to give effect to the correction of certain accounting errors identified during the financial reporting process as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. As a result, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth below has been revised to give effect to the correction of these errors. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange Act ”), that are not historical facts, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report including, without limitation, statements in this “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” regarding the Company’s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “goal,” “intend,” “continue,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “shall,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “estimate,” “seek” and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management’s current expectations, projections and beliefs based on information currently available. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about the Company that may cause its actual business, financial condition, results of operations, performance and/or achievements to be materially different from any future business, financial condition, results of operations, performance and/or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described under “ Risk Factors ” and “ Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements ” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “ Annual Report ”) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on June 21, 2022 and the Company’s other filings with the SEC. The Company’s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC’s website at
www.sec.gov . Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Introduction We are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our business operations through Reservoir Media Management, Inc. (“ RMM ”) and RMM’s subsidiaries. Our activities are generally organized into two operating segments: Music Publishing and Recorded Music. Operations of the Music Publishing segment involve the acquisition of interests in music catalogs from which royalties are earned as well as signing songwriters to exclusive agreements, which gives us an interest in the future delivery of songs. Operations of the Recorded Music segment involve the acquisition of sound recording catalogs as well as the discovery and development of recording artists and the marketing, distribution, sale and licensing of the music catalogs. Business Overview
We are an independent music company operating in music publishing and recorded music. We represent over 140,000 copyrights in our publishing business and over 36,000 master recordings in our recorded music business. Both of our business areas are populated with hit songs dating back to the early 1900s representing an array of artists across genre and geography. Consistent with how we classify and operate our business, the Company is organized in two operating and reportable segments: Music Publishing and Recorded Music. A brief description of each segment’s operations is presented below. 23
Table of Contents Music Publishing Segment Music Publishing is an intellectual property business focused on generating revenue from uses of the musical composition itself. In return for promoting, placing, marketing and administering the creative output of a songwriter or engaging in those activities for other rightsholders, our Music Publishing business garners a share of the revenues generated from use of the musical compositions.
The operations of our Music Publishing business are conducted principally through RMM, our global music publishing company headquartered in New York City, with operations in multiple countries through various subsidiaries, affiliates and non-affiliated licensees and sub-publishers. We own or control rights to more than 140,000 musical compositions, including numerous pop hits, American standards, folk songs and motion picture and theatrical compositions. Assembled over many years, our current award-winning active songwriters exceed 100, while the catalog includes over 5,000 clients representing a diverse range of genres, including pop, rock, jazz, classical, country, R&B, hip-hop, rap, reggae, Latin, folk, blues, symphonic, soul, Broadway, techno, alternative and gospel. Music Publishing revenues are derived from five main sources: ● Digital ––the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to musical compositions embodied in recordings distributed in streaming services, download services and other digital music services; ● Performance ––the rightsholder receives revenues if the musical composition is performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio and cable and in retail locations ( e.g. , bars and restaurants), live performance at a concert or other venue ( e.g. , arena concerts and nightclubs), and performance of music in staged theatrical productions; ● Synchronization ––the rightsholder receives revenues for the right to use the musical composition in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games; ● Mechanical ––the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to musical compositions embodied in recordings sold in any machine-readable format or configuration such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs; and ● Other ––the rightsholder receives revenues for use in sheet music and other uses. The principal costs associated with our Music Publishing business are as follows: ● Writer Royalties and Other Publishing Costs ––the artist and repertoire (“ A&R ”) costs associated with (i) paying royalties to songwriters, co-publishers and other copyright holders in connection with income generated from the uses of their works and (ii) signing and developing songwriters; and ● Administration Expenses ––the costs associated with general overhead, and other administrative expenses, as well as selling and marketing. Recorded Music Segment Our Recorded Music business consists of three primary areas of sound recording ownership. First is the active marketing, promotion, distribution, sale and licensing of newly created frontline sound recordings from Current Artists that we own and control. This is a new area of focus for us and does not yet produce significant revenue. The second is the active marketing, promotion, distribution, sale and license of previously recorded and subsequently acquired Catalog recordings. The third is acquisition of full or partial interests in existing record labels, sound recording catalogs or income rights to a royalty stream associated with an established recording artist or producer contract in connection with existing sound recordings. Acquisition of these income participation interests are typically in connection with recordings that are owned, controlled, and marketed by other record labels. 24
Table of Contents Our Current Artist and Catalog recorded music businesses are both primarily handled by our Chrysalis Records label based in London and our Tommy Boy record label based in New York City. In the United States, we also manage some select Catalog recorded music under our Philly Groove Records and Reservoir Records labels. We also own income participation interests in recordings by The Isley Brothers, The Commodores, Wisin and Yandel, Alabama and Travis Tritt, and an interest in the Loud Records catalog containing recordings by the Wu-Tang Clan. Our core Catalog includes recordings under the Chrysalis Records label by artists such as Sinéad O’Connor, The Specials, Generation X and The Waterboys, and De La Soul, as well as recordings under the Tommy Boy record label by artists such as House of Pain, Naughty By Nature, and Queen Latifah. Our Current Artist and Catalog recorded music distribution is handled by a network of distribution partners. Chrysalis Records current artist releases are distributed through PIAS while our Chrysalis Records and Tommy Boy catalogs are distributed via our membership with MERLIN, AMPED, Proper and other partners. Through our distribution network, our music is being sold in physical retail outlets as well as in physical form to online physical retailers, such as amazon.com, and distributed in digital form to an expanding universe of digital partners, including streaming services such as Amazon, Apple, Deezer, SoundCloud, Spotify, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and YouTube, radio services such as iHeart Radio and SiriusXM, and download services. We also license music digitally to fitness platforms such as Apple Fitness+, Equinox, Hydrow and Peloton and social media outlets, such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snap. Recorded Music revenues are derived from four main sources: ● Digital ––the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to streaming and download services; ● Physical ––the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to sales of physical products such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs; ● Neighboring Rights ––the rightsholder also receives royalties if sound recordings are performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio, and cable, and in public spaces such as shops, workplaces, restaurants, bars and clubs; and ● Synchronization ––the rightsholder receives royalties or fees for the right to use sound recordings in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games. The principal costs associated with our Recorded Music business are as follows: ● Artist Royalties and Other Recorded Costs ––the A&R costs associated with (i) paying royalties to recording artists, producers, songwriters, other copyright holders and trade unions, (ii) signing and developing recording artists and (iii) creating master recordings in the studio; and product costs to manufacture, package and distribute products to wholesale and retail distribution outlets; and ● Administration Expenses ––the costs associated with general overhead and other administrative expenses as well as the costs associated with the promotion and marketing of recording artists and music, including costs to produce music videos for promotional purposes and artist tour support. Business Combination On July 28, 2021 (the “ Closing Date ”), we consummated a business combination (the “ Business Combination ”) between Roth CH Acquisition II Co. (“ ROCC ”) and Reservoir Holdings, Inc. (“ RHI ”). On the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into RHI, with RHI surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ROCC (the “ Business Combination ”). In connection with the Business Combination, “Roth CH Acquisition II Co.” was renamed “Reservoir Media, Inc.”  Our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “ Common
Stock ”) and warrants are traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“ NASDAQ ”) under the ticker symbols “RSVR” and “RSVRW,” respectively. 25
Table of Contents The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse capitalization. Under this method of accounting, ROCC was treated as the “acquired” company for accounting purposes, and the Business Combination was accounted as the equivalent of RHI issuing stock for the net assets of ROCC, accompanied by a recapitalization. RHI is deemed to be the accounting predecessor of the combined business and the successor SEC registrant, meaning that RHI’s financial statements for periods prior to the closing date are disclosed in periodic reports filed with the SEC. See Note 4, “ Business Combination and PIPE Investment ” to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the Business Combination and related transactions. COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in 2020 has disrupted physical and manufacturing supply chains and required the closures of physical retailers. Additionally, stay-at-home orders, limited indoor and outdoor gatherings and other restrictions have negatively affected our business in other ways, such as, making it impossible to hold live concert tours, delaying the release of new recordings and disrupting the production and release of motion pictures and television programs. However, the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated growth of other revenue streams such as fitness and interactive gaming (including augmented reality and virtual reality). Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Comparability Throughout our history, we have constantly acquired new assets and subsidiaries and signed new writers and more recently new recording artists. These investing activities have had the largest impact on our growth over time. We have also invested in our operations to create a platform for the Music Publishing and Recorded Music segments to scale and grow. We did not complete any individually significant acquisition transactions during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.  On June 2, 2021, we acquired, through a membership interest purchase agreement, Tommy Boy Music, LLC (" Tommy Boy "), a 40-year-old record label, which included a diverse catalog of primarily recorded music rights and some music publishing rights. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”). However, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures to assist readers in understanding our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures either exclude or include amounts that are not reflected in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, we have provided the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, a reconciliation to GAAP measures and a discussion of the reasons why management believes this information is useful to it and may be useful to investors. 26

Music Publishing revenues represented 67% and 69% of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Recorded Music revenues represented 25% and 29% of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.  Other revenue represented 7% and 2% of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. U.S. and international revenues represented 59% and 41%, respectively of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022. U.S. and international revenues each represented 50% of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The shift in geographic mix toward the U.S. is primarily the result of an increase in U.S. mechanical revenue as well as strong U.S. performance of the Recorded Music catalogs. 28
Table of Contents Total digital revenues increased by $3,133 thousand, or 24%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Total digital revenues represented 53% and 50% of consolidated revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Music Publishing revenues increased by $2,466 thousand, or 14%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase in Music Publishing revenue was mainly driven by strong organic growth on streaming platforms, as well as acquisitions of catalogs and revenue from the existing catalog, which led to increases in digital revenue, synchronization revenue and performance revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other revenues reflecting the nonrecurrence of revenues recognized in the prior year from Dubai Expo. On a geographic basis, U.S. Music Publishing revenues represented 56% of total Music Publishing revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 49% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. International Music Publishing revenues represented 44% of total Music Publishing revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 51% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Digital revenue increased by $748 thousand, or 17%, primarily due to recent acquisitions of various Recorded Music catalogs and the continued growth at music streaming services.  The $150 thousand decrease in physical revenue is related to lower revenue on artist royalty associated with physical sales from third-party record labels.  Synchronization revenue decreased by $793 thousand as a result of fewer licenses being placed in the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The $249 thousand increase in neighboring rights revenue was primarily due to recent acquisitions of various Recorded Music catalogs. On a geographic basis, U.S. Recorded Music revenues represented 55% of total Recorded Music revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 48% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. International Recorded Music revenues represented 45% of total Recorded Music revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 52% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This shift in Recorded Music geographic mix was driven primarily by improved strong domestic performance of various owned Recorded Music catalogs, partially offset by an unfavorable impact on Chrysalis revenue from the change in the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 vs. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021
Total revenues increased by $14,758 thousand, or 20%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, driven by an 17% increase in Music Publishing revenue, a 22% increase in Recorded Music revenue and a 165% increase in Other revenue related to the Company’s artist management business, reflecting strong touring and merchandise revenue in a post-COVID environment.

U.S. and international revenues represented 52% and 48%, respectively of total revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The shift in mix between Music Publishing and Recorded Music and the shift in geographic mix are both primarily attributable to the Tommy Boy Acquisition.  Additionally, the shift in geographic mix is partly the result of an updated estimate of U.S. mechanical royalties related to the recent CRB ruling and an unfavorable impact on Chrysalis revenue from the change in the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Total digital revenues increased by $10,044 thousand, or 26%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021.

The increase in income tax expense and effective tax rate during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was driven by incremental tax expense of $3,659 thousand due to the increase in the value of deferred tax liabilities arising from a change in estimate of the applicable tax rate used to measure our international deferred tax liabilities in the United Kingdom. Net (Loss) Income
Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 vs. Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Net loss was $4,066 thousand during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of $1,410 thousand during the three months ended December 31, 2021. This change was driven primarily by a $3,135 increase in income tax expense, a $1,843 thousand decrease in gain (loss) on fair value of swaps, a $1,599 thousand increase in interest expense and a $914 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by a $1,910 thousand increase in operating income. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 vs. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021 Net income decreased to $436 thousand during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $4,275 thousand during the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The $3,838 thousand decrease in net income was driven primarily by a $3,810 thousand increase in income tax expense, a $2,572 thousand increase in interest expense, and $914 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by a $1,813 thousand increase in operating income and a $1,434 thousand increase in gain on fair value of swaps. 34
Table of Contents Non-GAAP Reconciliations
We use certain financial information, such as OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, which means they have not been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reservoir’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations, measure its performance and make strategic decisions. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding our results of operations and trends in the same manner as our management and in evaluating our financial measures as compared to the financial measures of other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by our management about which items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Using such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation to analyze our business would have material limitations because the calculations are based on the subjective determination of our management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances. In addition, although other companies in our industry may report measures titled OIBDA, OIBDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA, or similar measures, such non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from how we calculate such non-GAAP financial measures, which reduces their overall usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered alongside other financial performance measures and other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of OIBDA to operating income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income are provided below. We consider operating income before non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and non-cash amortization of intangible assets (“ OIBDA ”) to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses and believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors because it removes the significant impact of amortization from our results of operations and represents our measure of segment income. However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses and other non-operating income. Accordingly, OIBDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income, net income attributable to us and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definition of OIBDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. OIBDA Margin is defined as OIBDA as a percentage of revenue. EBITDA is defined as earnings (net income or loss) before net interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and non-cash amortization of intangible assets and is used by management to measure operating performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude items or expenses such as, among others, (1) any non-cash charges (including any impairment charges and loss on early extinguishment of debt), (2) any net gain or loss on foreign exchange, (3) any net gain or loss resulting from interest rate swaps, (4) equity-based compensation expense and (5) certain unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. However, certain limitations on the use of Adjusted EBITDA include, among others, (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business, (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA measure adds back certain non-cash, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. 35

Additionally, Other OIBDA related to the Company’s artist management business increased by $337 thousand during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, driven by strong touring and merchandise revenue.  Expressed as a percentage of revenue, OIBDA Margin increased to 34% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 30% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of improved operating leverage. Music Publishing OIBDA increased by $1,193 thousand, or 26%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Expressed as a percentage of revenue, Music Publishing OIBDA Margin increased to 29% in the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 26% in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increases in Music Publishing OIBDA and OIBDA Margin reflect the operating leverage of the segment. 36
Table of Contents Recorded Music OIBDA increased by $971 thousand, or 36% during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Expressed as a percentage of revenue, Recorded Music OIBDA Margin increased to 48% during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 36% in the three months ended December 31, 2021. These increases reflect improved operating leverage on the Recorded Music platform as a result of growth and a decrease in physical revenue, which carries a higher cost of revenue than other revenue types. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 vs. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021 Consolidated OIBDA increased by $4,333 thousand, or 18%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, driven by a 57% increase in Recorded Music OIBDA.  Additionally, Other OIBDA related to the Company’s artist management business increased by $272 thousand during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, driven by strong touring and merchandise revenue. Expressed as a percentage of revenue, OIBDA Margin decreased to 33% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from 34% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of increased administration expenses associated with operating as a public company, an increase in share-based compensation expense and increased costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by revenue growth. Music Publishing OIBDA decreased by $105 thousand, or 1%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Expressed as a percentage of revenue, Music Publishing OIBDA Margin decreased to 27% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from 32% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decreases in Music Publishing OIBDA and OIBDA Margin reflect increases in administration expenses associated with operating as a public company and higher writers’ royalties, primarily due to an updated estimate of mechanical royalties related to the recent CRB ruling, partially offset by revenue growth. Recorded Music OIBDA increased by $4,167 thousand, or 57% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Expressed as a percentage of revenue, Recorded Music OIBDA Margin increased to 48% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from 37% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021. These increases reflect the acquisition of Tommy Boy, improved operating leverage on the Recorded Music platform as a result of growth and a decrease in physical revenue, which carries a higher cost of revenue that other revenue types, partially offset by increases in administration expenses associated with operating as a public company.

Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 vs. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5,316 thousand, or 21%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, driven primarily by an increase in revenue, partially offset by increases in cost of revenue and administration expenses, including administration expenses associated with operating as a public company. Expressed as a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 36% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, which is the net result of improved operating leverage offset by nine months of public company costs in the current year with only five months of public company costs in the prior year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, we had $292,158 thousand of debt (net of $6,670 thousand of deferred financing costs) and $17,023 thousand of cash and cash equivalents. We used a portion of the proceeds from the Business Combination and PIPE Investment to repay $80,600 thousand of debt (amounts to related parties) associated with the Tommy Boy acquisition and $55,000 thousand of debt under the Senior Credit Facility. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our historical cash flows (in thousands). ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the Nine Months Ended ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ ​ ​ ​      2022      2021      $ Change Cash provided by (used in): ​ ​    ​ ​    ​ ​    Operating activities ​ $

The primary drivers of the $13,352 thousand increase in cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 were a decrease in cash used for working capital, primarily used for royalty advances (net of recoupments), and an increase in earnings, net of non-cash expenses. 38
Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $45,410 thousand for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $158,580 thousand for the nine months ended December, 2021. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to decreased acquisitions of music catalogs compared to 2021, which included the acquisition of Tommy Boy on June 2, 2021 for approximately $100 million. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $19,231 thousand for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $152,534 thousand for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily reflects the Business Combination and PIPE Investment that occurred in the prior year period. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our subsidiaries’ operations, available cash and cash equivalents and funds available for drawing under our Senior Credit Facility (as described below). These sources of liquidity are needed to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities we may elect to make in the future. We believe that our primary sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next twelve months. Existing Debt as of December 31, 2022
As of December 31, 2022, our outstanding debt consisted of $298,828 thousand borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, remaining borrowing availability under the Senior Credit Facility was $151,172 thousand. We use cash generated from operations to service outstanding debt, consisting primarily of interest payments through maturity, and we expect to continue to refinance and extend maturity on the Senior Credit Facility for the foreseeable future. Debt Capital Structure Since 2014, RMM has been the borrower under a revolving credit and term loan agreement (the “ Prior Credit Facility ”) with SunTrust Bank (Truist Bank) as the administrative agent and lead arranger. The Prior Credit Facility has been amended and restated a number of times since 2014, generally leading to extensions of maturity dates and increases in the facility size. On July 28, 2021, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, RMM amended and restated the Prior Credit Facility by entering the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “ RMM Credit Agreement ”), providing RMM with a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate amount of $248,750 thousand.  On December 7, 2021, RMM entered into an amendment (the “ First Amendment ”) to the RMM Credit Agreement. The First Amendment amended the RMM Credit Agreement to increase RMM’s senior secured revolving credit facility from $248,750 thousand to an aggregate amount of $350,000 thousand (the “ Senior Credit Facility ”).
39
Table of Contents On December 16, 2022, RMM entered into an amendment (the “ Second Amendment ”) to the RMM Credit Agreement.  The Second Amendment amended the RMM Credit Agreement to (i) increase RMM’s senior secured revolving credit facility from $350,000 thousand to $450,000 thousand, (ii) increase the incremental borrowing available under the facility’s accordion feature from $50,000 thousand to $150,000 thousand , (iii) extend the maturity date of the loans advanced under the RMM Credit Agreement from October 16, 2024 to December 16, 2027, (iv) modify the interest rate to be equal to either the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 1.00% or the sum of a SOFR rate plus a margin of 2.00%, in each case subject to a 0.25% increase based on a consolidated net senior debt to library value ratio, (v) remove the existing total leverage ratio financial covenant of no greater than 7.50:1.00 (net of up to $20,000 thousand of certain cash balances) as of the end of each fiscal quarter, (vi) reduce the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant to 1.10:1.00 and (vii) modify the consolidated senior debt to library value ratio financial covenant to 0.450, subject to certain adjustments. In connection with the Second Amendment, RMM recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $914 thousand that reflects the write-off of a portion of unamortized previous debt issuance costs and capitalized approximately $3,500 thousand in new debt issuance costs.  RMM is also required to pay an unused fee in respect of unused commitments under the Senior Credit Facility, if any, at a rate of 0.25% per annum. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to take opportunistic steps to extend our maturity dates and reduce related interest expense. From time to time, we may incur additional indebtedness for, among other things, working capital, repurchasing, redeeming or tendering for existing indebtedness and acquisitions or other strategic transactions.
Certain terms of the Senior Credit Facility are described below. Guarantees and Security The obligations under the Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by us, RHI and subsidiaries of RMM. Substantially all of our, RHI’s, RMM’s and other subsidiary guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets are pledged as collateral to secure the obligations of RMM under the Senior Credit Facility, including accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, deposit accounts, securities accounts, commodities accounts, inventory and certain intercompany debt owing to us or our subsidiaries. Covenants, Representations and Warranties The Senior Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants contained in the Senior Credit Facility limit the ability our, RHI’s, RMM’s and certain of its subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur debt or liens, merge or consolidate with others, make investments, make cash dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock, dispose of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates or enter into certain restrictive agreements. Events of Default The Senior Credit Facility includes customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal when due, nonpayment of interest or other amounts, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, violation of covenants, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain ERISA events and certain material judgments, in each case, subject to customary thresholds, notice and grace period provisions. 40
Table of Contents Covenant Compliance The Senior Credit Facility contains financial covenants that requires us, on a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries, to maintain, (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00 for each four fiscal quarter period, and (iii) a consolidated senior debt to library value ratio of no greater than 0.45:1.00, subject to certain adjustments.
Non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated senior debt to library value ratio could result in the lenders, subject to customary cure rights, requiring the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.2x and a consolidated senior debt to library value ratio less than 30.3%, we were in compliance with both of the financial covenants under the Senior Credit Facility. Interest Rate Swaps At December 31, 2022, RMM had the following interest rate swaps outstanding, under which it pays a fixed rate and receives a floating interest payment from the counterparty based on LIBOR with reference to notional amounts adjusted to match the original scheduled principal repayments pursuant to the indenture agreement: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Notional ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​  Amount at  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ Pay Fixed ​ ​ Effective Date       2022       Rate    Maturity March 10, 2022 ​ $

87,860
1.492 %   September 2024 December 31, 2021 ​ $
53,765
1.042 %   September 2024 ​ In January 2023, RMM modified these outstanding interest rate swaps to replace the floating rate interest payments received from the counterparty based on LIBOR to floating rate interest payments received from the counterparty based on SOFR, with corresponding adjustments to the fixed rates paid by RMM.  The change in the reference rate in these interest rate swaps from LIBOR to SOFR did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On March 10, 2022, two previous interest rate swaps expired with original notional amounts of $40,228 thousand and $59,325 thousand. Those interest rate swaps were replaced by two new swaps with original notional amounts of $88,090 thousand and $8,875 thousand which add to a third interest rate swap with an original notional amount of $53,030 thousand.  All three current interest rate swaps mature on September 30, 2024, and RMM pays fixed rates of 1.492%, 1.602% and 1.042%, respectively, to the counterparty and received a floating interest payment from the counterparty based on LIBOR with reference to notional amounts adjusted to match the original scheduled principal repayments pursuant to the indenture agreement. Dividends Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by covenants in the Senior Credit Facility. We did not pay any dividends to stockholders during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. 41
Table of Contents Summary Management believes that funds generated from our operations, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. However, our ability to continue to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other industry-specific factors such as the ability to control music piracy and the continued transition from physical to digital formats in the recorded music and music publishing industries. It could also be affected by the severity and duration of natural or man-made disasters, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We and our affiliates continue to evaluate opportunities to, from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to pay dividends or prepay outstanding debt or repurchase or retire our outstanding debt. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings or equity raises. In addition, from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity, and other factors, we may seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facility with existing cash and/or with funds provided from additional borrowings. Contractual and Other Obligations As of December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, in our contractual obligations since March 31, 2022. See “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual and Other Obligations ” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 21, 2022 for information regarding our contractual obligations. Critical Accounting Policies As of December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies since March 31, 2022. See “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies ” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 21, 2022 for information regarding our critical accounting policies. We believe that our accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. The future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position are unclear. However, we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3, “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements”

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item 3, “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk .” ​ ​ 42
Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified in the Annual Report. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our previously identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting relate to (i) an ineffective control environment due to improper segregation of duties and a lack of qualified personnel to address certain complex accounting transactions, and (ii) an ineffective risk assessment process resulting in improper design of control activities to address certain risks of material misstatement. These material weaknesses resulted in immaterial misstatements in our previously reported consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, and 2021, and unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for each of the quarterly and fiscal year-to-date periods ended December 31, 2020, and 2021, related to the accounting for the acquisition of certain music catalogs, which were corrected prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We continue to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above by hiring additional qualified accounting personnel and further evolving our accounting processes. We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and we have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls and Procedures Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all cases of error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. ​ 43
Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We may, from time to time, become involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, claims, lawsuits and/or other actions incidental to the conduct of our business. Some of these legal and administrative proceedings, claims, lawsuits and/or other actions may be material and involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties and could result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. We recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherently uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes in the Company’s risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A to the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022. The risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, could materially affect our business, financial condition or results. ​ ​ Item 2.
