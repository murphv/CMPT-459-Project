GLOSSARY
The following terms are frequently used in the text of this report and have the meanings indicated below.
“Used Core” — An automobile part which has previously been used in the operation of a vehicle. Generally, the Used Core is an original equipment (“OE”) automobile part installed by the vehicle manufacturer and
subsequently removed for replacement. Used Cores contain salvageable parts, which are an important raw material in the remanufacturing process. We obtain most Used Cores by providing credits to our customers for Used Cores returned to us under
our core exchange programs. Our customers receive these Used Cores from consumers who deliver a Used Core to obtain credit from our customers upon the purchase of a newly remanufactured automobile part. When sufficient Used Cores are not
available from our customers, we purchase Used Cores from core brokers, who are in the business of buying and selling Used Cores. The Used Cores purchased from core brokers or returned to us by our customers under the core exchange programs, and
which have been physically received by us, are part of our raw material and work-in-process inventory. Used Cores returned by consumers to our customers but not yet returned to us are classified as contract assets until we physically receive
these Used Cores.
“Remanufactured Core” — The Used Core underlying an automobile part that has gone through the remanufacturing process and through that process has become part of a newly remanufactured automobile part. The
remanufacturing process takes a Used Core, breaks it down into its component parts, replaces those components that cannot be reused and reassembles the salvageable components of the Used Core and additional new components into a remanufactured
automobile part. Remanufactured Cores held for sale at our customer locations are included in long-term contract assets. The
Remanufactured Core portion of stock adjustment returns are classified as contract assets until we physically
receive them.

1. Company Background and Organization
Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, or “MPA”) is a leading supplier of automotive aftermarket non-discretionary replacement
parts, and test solutions and diagnostic equipment. These replacement parts are primarily sold to automotive retail chain stores and warehouse distributors throughout North America and to major automobile manufacturers for both their aftermarket
programs and warranty replacement programs (“OES”). The Company’s test solutions and diagnostic equipment primarily serves the global automotive component and powertrain testing market. The Company’s products include (i) rotating electrical products
such as alternators and starters, (ii) wheel hub assemblies and bearings, (iii) brake-related products, which include brake calipers, brake boosters, brake rotors, brake pads, and brake master cylinders, and (iv) other products, which include (a)

systems for alternators and starters, belt starter generators, bench-top testers, and specialized test services for electric vehicle inverters.
Pursuant to the guidance provided under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for segment reporting, the
Company has identified its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), reviewed the documents used by the CODM, and understands how such documents are used by the CODM to make financial and operating decisions. The Company has determined through this
review process that its business comprises
three
separate operating segments. The operating segments meet all the criteria to be
aggregated and are presented as such.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the U.S. and global economies – creating uncertainty regarding the potential effects on the supply chain
disruptions, rate of inflation, increasing interest rates, and customer demand. The extent to which these may impact the Company will depend on numerous factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Company
may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business because of an economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.

7. Debt
The Company is party to a $ 268,620,000
senior
secured financing, (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, consisting of (i) a $ 238,620,000
revolving loan facility, subject to borrowing base restrictions, a $ 24,000,000
sublimit for borrowings by Canadian borrowers, and a $ 20,000,000
sublimit for letters of credit (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a $ 30,000,000
term loan facility (the “Term Loans”). The loans under the Credit Facility mature on
May 28, 2026 . The Credit Facility currently permits the payment of up to $ 29,043,000
of dividends and share repurchases for fiscal year 2023, subject to pro forma compliance with financial covenants. In connection with the Credit Facility, the lenders have a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company.
The Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of $ 937,500 . The Credit Facility bears interest at rates equal
to either SOFR (as defined below) plus a margin of
2.25 %,
2.50 % or
2.75 % or a reference rate plus a margin of
1.25 %,
1.50 % or
1.75 %, in each case depending on the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. There is also a facility fee of
0.375 % to
0.50 %, depending on the senior
leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. The interest rate on the Company’s Term Loans and Revolving Facility was
6.98 % and
7.16 % respectively, at December 31, 2022, and
2.99 % and
3.13 % respectively, at March 31, 2022.
The Credit Facility, among other things, requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants including a maximum senior leverage
ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the Credit Facility places limits on the Company’s ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in
asset sales, redeem, or repurchase capital stock, alter the business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries, transact with affiliates, prepay, redeem, or purchase subordinated debt, and amend or otherwise alter debt agreements.
On November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Fourth Amendment”). The Fourth Amendment,
among other things, (i) modified the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, (ii) modified the total leverage ratio financial covenant for the fiscal quarter ending
September 30, 2022, (iii) modified the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”, and (iv) replaced LIBOR as the benchmark rate with a replacement benchmark based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) effective beginning November 3, 2022.
The modifications to the financial covenants were effective as of September 30, 2022.

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2022, the Company identified certain defaults with respect to
the Credit Facility, which arose from non-compliance with certain financial covenants. On February 3, 2023, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Fifth Amendment”). The Fifth Amendment, among other things, (i)
waived certain existing defaults and events of default arising from non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and senior leverage ratio financial covenants as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, (ii) modified the
fixed charge coverage ratio and senior leverage ratio financial covenants for the quarters ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, (iii) modified the definitions of “Applicable Margin” and “Consolidated EBITDA”, and (iv) added a new minimum
undrawn availability financial covenant.

9. Leases
The Company leases various facilities in North America and Asia under operating leases expiring through August 2033. The Company has material nonfunctional currency leases that could have a material impact on the Company’s
condensed consolidated statements of operations. As required for other monetary liabilities, lessees remeasure foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities using the exchange rate at each reporting date, but the lease assets are nonmonetary
assets measured at historical rates and are not affected by subsequent changes in the exchange rates. In connection with the remeasurement of these leases, the Company recorded a gain of $ 3,129,000
and a loss of $ 985,000
during the three months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021,
respectively . During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded gains of $ 2,108,000
and $ 64,000 , respectively, in connection with the remeasurement of
these leases. These amounts are included in “foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Basic
net
income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing net
income
(loss)
by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net
income
(loss)
per share includes the effect, if any, from the potential exercise or conversion of securities, such as stock options, which would result in the issuance of incremental shares of common stock to the extent
such impact is not anti-dilutive.

for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 9,296,000 , or an
effective tax rate of
62.1 %, and income tax expense of $ 4,786,000 , or an effective tax rate of
38.4 %, for the nine months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Effective tax rates are based on current annual projections and any changes in future periods could result in an effective tax rate that is materially different from the current estimate. The effective tax
rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily impacted by (i) specific jurisdictions that the Company does not expect to recognize the benefit of losses, (ii) foreign income taxed at rates that are different from the
federal statutory rate, and (iii) non-deductible executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m).
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state, and foreign jurisdictions with varying
statutes of limitations. At December 31, 2022, the Company is not under examination in any jurisdiction, and remain subject to examination from the years ended March 31, 2017. The Company believes no significant changes in the unrecognized tax
benefits will occur within the next 12 months.
13. Financial Risk Management and Derivatives
Purchases and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which are primarily related to the Company’s overseas facilities, expose the
Company to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies. The Company’s primary risk exposure is from fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso and to a lesser extent the Chinese
yuan. To mitigate these risks, the Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for these foreign currencies. The extent to which forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used, is modified
periodically in response to the Company’s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of anticipated requirements.
The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in
currency speculation. The use of derivative financial instruments allows the Company to reduce its exposure to the risk that the eventual cash outflow resulting from funding the expenses of the foreign operations will be materially affected by
changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company designates forward foreign currency exchange contracts for forecasted expenditure
requirements to fund foreign operations.
The Company had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with a U.S. dollar
equivalent notional value of
$ 47,369,000
and
$ 44,968,000
at December 31 ,   2022
and March
31,   2022,
respectively. These contracts generally have a term of
one year
or less, at rates agreed at the inception of the contracts. The counterparty to this derivative transaction is a major financial institution with investment grade credit
rating; however, the Company is exposed to credit risk with this institution. The credit risk is limited to the potential unrealized gains (which offset currency fluctuations adverse to the Company) in any such contract should this counterparty
fail to perform as contracted. Any changes in the fair values of forward foreign currency exchange contracts are included in “foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts” in the condensed consolidated statements of
operations.

Short-term Investments and Deferred Compensation
The Company’s short-term investments,
which fund its deferred compensation liabilities, consist of investments in mutual funds. These investments are classified as Level
1
as the shares of these mutual funds trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable the Company to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
The forward foreign currency exchange
contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers (See Note
13) .
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the revolving loan, term loan and other long-term liabilities approximate their fair value based on the variable nature of interest rates and
current rates for instruments with similar characteristics.

the target performance level as deemed probable at quarter-end.
Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”)
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted
126,028
and
84,593
PSUs (at target
performance levels), respectively,
which typically cliff vest after
three-years
subject to continued employment. These awards
are contingent and granted separately for each of the following metrics: adjusted EBITDA, net sales, and relative total shareholder return (“TSR”). Compensation cost is determined at the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period to the extent the conditions are deemed probable. The number of shares earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from
0 % to
150 % of the target number of PSUs granted. PSUs are not
considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company.
19
Table of Contents
Adjusted EBITDA and net sales are considered performance conditions. The Company will reassess the probability of achieving each performance condition
separately each reporting period. TSR is considered a market condition because it measures the Company’s return against the performance of the Russell 3000, excluding companies classified as financials and real estate, over a given period of
time. Compensation cost related to the TSR award will not be adjusted even if the market condition is not met.
The Company calculated the fair value of the PSUs for each component individually. The fair value of PSUs subject to performance conditions is equal to
the closing stock price on the grant date. The fair value of PSUs subject to the market condition is determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model.

16. Commitments and Contingencies
Warranty Returns
The Company allows its customers to return goods that their consumers have returned to them, whether or not the returned item is defective (“warranty
returns”). The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty returns based on a historical analysis of the level of this type of return as a percentage of unit sales. Amounts charged to expense for these warranty returns are considered in
arriving at the Company’s net sales.

The Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims. In addition, government agencies and self-regulatory organizations have the ability to conduct
periodic examinations of and administrative proceedings regarding the Company’s business. Following an audit in fiscal 2019, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that it believed that the Company owed additional duties of approximately $ 17
million from 2011 through mid-2018 relating to products that it imported from Mexico. The Company does not believe that this amount is correct and
believes that it has numerous defenses and intends to dispute this amount vigorously. The Company cannot assure that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will agree or that it will not need to accrue or pay additional amounts in the future.
17. Share Repurchases
In August 2018, the Company’s board of directors approved an increase in its share repurchase program
from $ 20,000,000
to $ 37,000,000
of its common stock. During the three
and nine mont hs ended December 31, 2022, the Company did
no t repurchase any shares of its common
stock. As of December 31, 2022, $ 18,745,000
was utilized and $ 18,255,000
remains available to repurchase shares under the authorized share repurchase program, subject to the limit in the Company’s Credit Facility. The Company retired the
837,007
shares repurchased under this program through December 31, 2022. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any
specific number of shares and shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis presents factors that Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“our,” “we” or “us”) believe are relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of
operations. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with our March 31, 2022 audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on
June 14, 2022.
Disclosure Regarding Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to our future performance that involve risks and uncertainties.
All
statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about our strategic initiatives, operational plans and objectives, expectations for economic conditions and recovery and
future business and financial performance, as well as statements regarding underlying assumptions related thereto.
They include, among others, factors related to the timing and implementation of strategic initiatives, the highly
competitive nature of our industry, demand for our products and services, complexities in our inventory and supply chain, challenges with transforming and growing our business and factors related to the current global COVID-19 pandemic. Except as
required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on those statements. Please refer to
“ Item
1A.
Risk Factors ” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2022, as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC, for a description of these and other
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by the forward-looking statements.
Management Overview
We have a multi-pronged platform for growth within the automotive aftermarket for non-discretionary replacement hard parts and test solutions. In addition, we offer diagnostic equipment applications focused on the fast-evolving electric mobility
markets. Our investments in infrastructure and human resources during the past few years reflects the significant expansion of manufacturing capacity to support multiple product lines and continues to be transformative and scalable. These
investments included (i) a 410,000 square foot distribution center, (ii) two buildings totaling 372,000 square feet for remanufacturing and core sorting of brake calipers, and (iii) the realignment of production at our initial 312,000 square foot
facility in Mexico. New products introduced through our growth strategies include brake pads and rotors, which were formally introduced during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
Pursuant to the guidance provided under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for segment reporting, we have identified our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”),
reviewed the documents used by the CODM, and understand how such documents are used by the CODM to make financial and operating decisions. We have determined through this review process that our business comprises three separate operating segments.
The operating segments meet all the criteria to be aggregated and are presented as such.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the U.S. and global economies – creating uncertainty regarding the potential effects on the supply chain disruptions, rate of inflation, increasing interest rates, and
customer demand. We incurred costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are included in cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, of $396,000 and $764,000 during the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $1,873,000 and $2,573,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Annualized finished goods turnover for the fiscal quarter is calculated by multiplying cost of goods sold for the quarter by 4 and dividing the result by the average between beginning and ending non-core finished goods inventory values
for the fiscal quarter. We believe this provides a useful measure of our ability to turn our inventory into revenues. Our finished goods turnover ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by our investment in inventory
to address disruptions related to the global supply chain and logistics challenges to meet higher anticipated future sales.

Net Sales . Our net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $151,819,000, which represents a decrease of $9,991,000, or 6.2%, from the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $161,810,000.
Sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were impacted by (i) inventory reduction initiatives from one of our largest customers, (ii) changes in the purchasing and return patterns of certain customers, (iii) disruptions with global supply
chain and logistics services, and (iv) general economic conditions including extreme weather.
Gross Profit.
Our gross profit was $20,993,000, or 13.8% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared with $32,575,000, or 20.1% of net sales, for the
three months ended December 31, 2021. Our gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022 reflects (i) higher inflationary costs— including disruptions with the global supply chain, logistics services, higher wages, (ii) lower
absorption of overhead costs as we manage our inventory levels, and (iii) changes in product mix.
Our gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was impacted by (i) additional expenses of $2,370,000 and $3,006,000, respectively, primarily due to certain costs for disruptions in the supply
chain, (ii) amortization of core and finished goods premiums paid to customers related to new business of $3,075,000   and $3,146,000, respectively, and (iii) the non-cash quarterly revaluation of cores that
are part of the finished goods on the customers’ shelves (which are included in contract assets) to the lower of cost or net realizable value, which resulted in a write-down of $863,000 and $846,000, respectively.
Additionally, our gross margin was impacted for the three months ended December 31, 2021 by higher freight costs, net of certain price increases, of approximately $1,338,000.

General and Administrative.
Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $13,599,000, which represents a decrease of $1,006,000, or 6.9%, from the three months
ended December 31, 2021 of $14,605,000. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $1,060,000 of decreased employee incentives and (ii) $1,009,000 of decreased share-based compensation in connection with equity grants made to employees. These decreases
were partially offset by (i) $723,000 of increased severance expense due to headcount reduction and (ii) $375,000 of increased employee-related expense at our offshore locations.
Sales and Marketing . Our sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $5,634,000, which represents a decrease of $640,000, or 10.2%, from the three months ended December
31, 2021 of $6,274,000. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $325,000 of decreased marketing and advertising expenses, (ii) $325,000 of decreased commissions due to lower sales, and (iii) $289,000 of decreased employee-related expenses due to our
cost-cutting measures. These decreases were partially offset by $265,000 for increased trade shows as normal business expenses resumed.
Research and Development . Our research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $2,547,000, which represents a decrease of $88,000, or 3.3%, from the three months ended
December 31, 2021 of $2,635,000. This decrease was primarily due to our cost-cutting measures.
Foreign Exchange Impact of Lease Liabilities and Forward Contracts . Our foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was a non-cash gain
of $4,313,000 compared with a non-cash loss of $385,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to (i) the remeasurement of our foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities, which resulted in a non-cash gain of
$3,129,000 compared with a non-cash loss of $985,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and (ii) the forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which resulted in
non-cash gains of $1,184,000 and $600,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to the changes in their fair values.
Interest Expense
Interest Expense, net.
Our interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $11,471,000, which represents an increase of $7,522,000, or 190.5%, from interest
expense for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $3,949,000. Of this increase in interest expense, approximately 98% resulted from higher interest rates and approximately 73% of this increase resulted from our accounts receivable discount
programs utilized by our customers. Our borrowing and receivable discount programs have interest costs that vary with interest rate movements. In addition, our average borrowing under our credit facility increased during the three months ended
December 31, 2022 as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Provision for Income Taxes
Income Tax . We recorded an income tax benefit of $8,971,000, or an effective tax rate of 112.9%, and income tax expense of $1,588,000, or an effective tax rate of 33.6%, for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Effective tax rates are based on current annual projections and any changes in future periods could result in an effective tax rate that is materially different from the current estimate.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily impacted by (i) foreign income taxed at rates that are different from the federal statutory rate and (ii) non-deductible executive compensation under Internal
Revenue Code Section 162(m).

Annualized finished goods turnover for the fiscal period is calculated by multiplying cost of goods sold for the period by 1.33 and dividing the result by the average between beginning and ending non-core finished goods inventory values
for the fiscal period. We believe this provides a useful measure of our ability to turn our inventory into revenues. Our finished goods turnover ratio for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by our investment in inventory
to address disruptions related to the global supply chain and logistics challenges to meet higher anticipated future sales.

Net Sales . Our net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $488,347,000, which represents an increase of $1,955,000, or 0.4%, from the nine months ended December 31, 2021 of $486,392,000,
which was positively impacted by $13,327,000 in core revenue due to a realignment of inventory at certain customer distribution centers. Excluding the core revenue in the prior year, net sales increased $15,282,000, or 3.2%, for the nine months
ended December 31, 2022, reflecting increasing sales of our growing brake-related product lines. This increase in sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were partially offset by inventory reduction initiatives from one of our largest
customers and disruptions with global supply chain and logistics services.

Gross Profit.
Our gross profit was $77,811,000, or 15.9% of net sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared with $92,097,000, or 18.9% of net sales, for the nine
months ended December 31, 2021. Our gross margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 reflects (i) higher inflationary costs— including disruptions with the global supply chain, logistics services, related higher freight costs, higher
wages, (ii) impact of core revenue in the prior period due to a realignment of inventory at certain customer distribution centers, and (iii) changes in product mix.
Our gross margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was impacted by (i) higher freight costs, net of certain price increases, of $3,290,000, and $7,413,000, respectively, (ii) additional expenses due
to certain costs for disruptions in the supply chain of $5,282,000 and $7,144,000, respectively, (iii) amortization of core and finished goods premiums paid to customers related to new business of $9,183,000   and
$9,013,000, respectively.
In addition, gross margin was impacted by non-cash quarterly revaluation of cores that are part of the finished goods on the customers’ shelves (which are included in contract assets) to the lower of cost or net
realizable value, which resulted in a write-down of $2,704,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, gross margin was impacted by non-cash quarterly revaluation of cores that are part of the finished goods on the customers’ shelves (which are included in contract assets) to
the lower of cost or net realizable value and gain due to realignment of inventory at customer distribution centers, which resulted in a net gain of $1,229,000. Gross margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was further impacted by
transition expenses in connection with the expansion of our brake-related operations in Mexico of $2,744,000.

General and Administrative.
Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $42,079,000, which represents an increase of $523,000, or 1.3%, from the nine months
ended December 31, 2021 of $41,556,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $1,722,000 of increased expense resulting from foreign currency transactions, (ii) $1,071,000 of increased severance expense due to headcount reduction, (iii) $491,000
of increased employee-related expense at our offshore locations, (iv) $436,000 of increased information technology costs in connection with cybersecurity and other productivity tools, (v) $301,000 of increased professional services, (vi) $299,000
of increased employee-related expense, and (vii) $282,000 of increased general insurance expense. These increases were partially offset by (i) $2,129,000 of decreased employee incentives and (ii) $1,936,000 of decreased share-based compensation in
connection with equity grants made to employees.
Sales and Marketing . Our sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $17,242,000, which represents an increase of $80,000, or 0.5%, from the nine months ended December
31, 2021 of $17,162,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $424,000 for increased trade shows as normal business expenses resumed, (ii) $366,000 of increased travel costs as some business travel resumed, and (iii) $93,000 of increased
commissions due to higher sales. These increases were partially offset by $592,000 of decreased marketing and advertising expenses and $139,000 of decreased employee-related expenses due to our cost-cutting measures.

Table of Contents
Research and Development . Our research and development expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $8,330,000, which represents an increase of $699,000, or 9.2%, from the nine months ended
December 31, 2021 of $7,631,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $356,000 of increased employee-related expenses, primarily due to our electric vehicle testing system initiatives, (ii) $271,000 of increased samples for our core library and
other research and development supplies, and (iii) $55,000 of increased outside services primarily due to development projects.
Foreign Exchange Impact of Lease Liabilities and Forward Contracts . Our foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was a non-cash gain
of $2,553,000 compared with a non-cash loss of $1,769,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to (i) the remeasurement of our foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities, which resulted in non-cash gains of
$2,108,000 and $64,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and (ii) the forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which resulted in a non-cash gain of $445,000
compared with a non-cash loss of $1,833,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to the changes in their fair values.
Interest Expense
Interest Expense, net.
Our interest expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $27,675,000, which represents an increase of $16,165,000, or 140.4%, from interest
expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 of $11,510,000. Of this increase in interest expense, approximately 96% resulted from higher interest rates and approximately 76% of this increase resulted from our accounts receivable discount
programs utilized by our customers. Our borrowing and receivable discount programs have interest costs that vary with interest rate movements. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, utilization of our accounts receivable discount programs
and our average borrowing under our credit facility increased.
Provision for Income Taxes
Income Tax . We recorded an income tax benefit of $9,296,000, or an effective tax rate of 62.1%, and income tax expense of $4,786,000, or an effective tax rate of 38.4%, for the
nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Effective tax rates are based on current annual projections and any changes in future periods could result in an effective tax rate that is materially different from the current estimate.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily impacted by (i) specific jurisdictions that we do not expect to recognize the benefit of losses, (ii) foreign income taxed at rates that are different from the
federal statutory rate, and (iii) non-deductible executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
We had working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of $122,892,000 and $110,580,000, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.3:1.0, at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in working
capital reflects our investment in inventory to address disruptions related to the global supply chain and logistics challenges to meet higher anticipated sales.
Our primary source of liquidity was from the use of our receivable discount programs and credit facility during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. In addition, we have access to our existing cash, as well as our available credit facilities
to meet short-term liquidity needs. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, use of receivable discount programs, amounts available under our credit facility, and other sources are sufficient to satisfy our expected future
working capital needs, repayment of the current portion of our term loans, and lease and capital expenditure obligations over the next 12 months.

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2022, we identified certain defaults with respect to the Credit Facility, which arose from non-compliance with certain financial covenants.
On February 3, 2023, we entered into a fifth
amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Fifth Amendment”). The Fifth Amendment, among other things, (i) waived certain existing defaults and events of defaults arising from non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and senior leverage
ratio financial covenants as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, (ii) modified the fixed charge coverage ratio and senior leverage ratio financial covenant levels for the quarters ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, (iii)
modified the definitions of “Applicable Margin” and “Consolidated EBITDA”, and (iv) added a new minimum undrawn availability financial covenant.
Share Repurchase Program
In August 2018, our board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase program from $20,000,000 to $37,000,000 of our common stock. As of December 31, 2022, $18,745,000 was utilized and $18,255,000 remains available to repurchase
shares under the authorized share repurchase program, subject to the limit in our credit facility. We retired the 837,007 shares repurchased under this program through December 31, 2022. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire
any specific number of shares and shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions.

Net cash used in operating activities was $21,428,000 and $22,174,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in our operating activities reflects a more significant build-up of inventory in the prior
year as compared with the current year partially offset by lower net income and lower accounts payable. We continue to manage our working capital to maximize our operating cash flow.
Net cash used in investing activities was $3,855,000 and $5,426,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in our investing activities primarily resulted from decreased capital expenditures due to the
completion of our expansion of
our brake-related operations
in Mexico during the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $14,898,000 and $19,770,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in our financing activities resulted from lower borrowing and higher repayments under our
credit facility during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. In addition, we repurchased 106,486 shares of our common stock for $1,914,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2021.

Capital Resources
Credit Facility
We are party to a $268,620,000 senior secured financing, (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders, and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, consisting of (i) a $238,620,000 revolving
loan facility, subject to borrowing base restrictions, a $24,000,000 sublimit for borrowings by Canadian borrowers, and a $20,000,000 sublimit for letters of credit (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a $30,000,000 term loan facility (the “Term
Loans”). The loans under the Credit Facility mature on May 28, 2026. The Credit Facility currently permits the payment of up to $29,043,000 of dividends and share repurchases for fiscal year 2022, subject to pro forma compliance with financial
covenants. In connection with the Credit Facility, the lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets.
The Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of $937,500. The Credit Facility bears interest at rates equal to either SOFR (as defined below) plus a margin of 2.25%, 2.50% or 2.75% or a reference rate plus a margin of 1.25%, 1.50% or
1.75%, in each case depending on the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. There is also a facility fee of 0.375% to 0.50%, depending on the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. The interest rate on
the Company’s Term Loans and Revolving Facility was 6.98% and 7.16% respectively, at December 31, 2022, and 2.99% and 3.13% respectively, at March 31, 2022.
The Credit Facility, among other things, requires us to maintain certain financial covenants including a maximum senior leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the Credit Facility places
limits on our ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales, redeem, or repurchase capital stock, alter the business conducted by us and our
subsidiaries, transact with affiliates, prepay, redeem, or purchase subordinated debt, and amend or otherwise alter debt agreements.
On November 3, 2022, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Fourth Amendment”). The Fourth Amendment, among other things, (i) modified the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant for the
fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, (ii) modified the total leverage ratio financial covenant for the quarter ending September 30, 2022, (iii) modified the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”, and (iv) replaced LIBOR
as the benchmark rate with a replacement benchmark based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) effective November 3, 2022. The modifications to the financial covenants were effective as of September 30, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, we identified certain defaults with respect to the Credit Facility, which arose from non-compliance with certain financial covenants. On February
3 ,
2023, we entered into the Fifth Amendment, which among other things, (i) waived certain existing defaults and events of defaults arising from non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and senior leverage ratio financial covenants as of
the end of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, (ii) modified the fixed charge coverage ratio and senior leverage ratio financial covenant levels for the quarters ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, (iii) modified the definitions of
“Applicable Margin” and “Consolidated EBITDA”, and (iv) added a new minimum undrawn availability financial covenant.
We had $175,000,000 and $155,000,000 outstanding under the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. In addition, $6,370,000 was outstanding for letters of credit at December 31, 2022. At
December 31, 2022, after certain contractual adjustments, $57,250,000 was available under the Revolving Facility.
Receivable Discount Programs
We use receivable discount programs with certain customers and their respective banks. Under these programs, we have options to sell those customers’ receivables to those banks at a discount to be agreed upon at the time the receivables are
sold. These discount arrangements allow us to accelerate receipt of payment on customers’ receivables. While these arrangements have reduced our working capital needs, there can be no assurance that these programs will continue in the future.
Interest expense resulting from these programs would increase if interest rates rise, if utilization of these discounting arrangements expands, if customers extend their payment to us, or if the discount period is extended to reflect more favorable
payment terms to customers.

Capital Expenditures
Our total capital expenditures, including finance leases and non-cash capital expenditures were $3,632,000 and $5,248,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These capital expenditures primarily include the
purchase of equipment for our current operations. We completed the expansion of our operations in Mexico during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect to incur approximately $1,500,000 of capital expenditures primarily to support our current
operations, including purchases of equipment, during the remainder of fiscal 2023. We fund these expenditures primarily from our working capital and leasing.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and
chief accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
30
Table of Contents
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief accounting officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief accounting officer concluded that MPA’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the three months ended
December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
