In addition, we or others on our behalf may make forward-looking statements from time to time in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or web casts open to the public, in press releases or reports, on our web sites or otherwise. Statements that are not historical are forward-looking and reflect expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations of future events and often can be identified in this report and elsewhere by using words such as "expect," "strive," "outlook," "guidance," "forecast," "goal," "anticipate," "continue," "plan," "estimate," "project," "target," "improve," "believe," "become," "should," "could," "will," "would," "possible," "may," "likely," "intend," "can," "pursue," "potential," "pro forma," variations of such words or the negative thereof, and similar expressions or future dates. Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our future performance, including our anticipated operating results, liquidity requirements and financial condition; the anticipated impacts of current global supply chain disruptions, the inflationary environment, the war between Ukraine and Russia and the related sanctions and geopolitical tensions, tight labor markets and other macroeconomic factors; our business strategies, priorities, goals, and commitments; acquisitions and business initiatives; and the effect of laws, rules, policies, regulations, tax reform, new accounting pronouncements, and outstanding litigation on our business and future performance. Forward-looking statements are only projections and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. The following are some of the factors known to us that could cause our actual results to differ materially from what we have anticipated in our forward-looking statements: • Adverse economic conditions and outlook in the United States and in other countries in which we conduct business, including as a result of the war between Ukraine and Russia and the related sanctions and geopolitical tensions or pandemics and/or epidemics, such as but not limited to: business closures, slowdowns, suspensions or delays of production and commercial activity; slow or negative economic growth rates or recessionary conditions; reduced or negative consumer confidence; reduced consumer spending levels; increased or prolonged high or low unemployment rates and tight labor markets; higher costs, longer lead times and reduced availability of commodities, components, parts, and accessories, including as a result of transportation-related costs, inflation, changing prices, foreign currency fluctuations, tariffs, and/or duties; inflationary or deflationary pressures; slowdowns or reductions in levels of interest in the game of golf or golf course activity, development, renovation, or improvement; golf course closures; reduced governmental or municipal spending; reduced infrastructure spending; reduced levels of home ownership, construction, or sales; home foreclosures; the impact of U.S. federal debt, state debt, and sovereign debt defaults; reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for us or our distributors, dealers, or end-user customers; higher short-term, mortgage, and other interest rates; and general economic and political conditions and expectations; • Continuing disruption, and/or shortages in the availability of and the cost of commodities, components, parts, or accessories used in our products; • Our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance; • Effect that weather conditions or climate change have on demand for our products and operations, including our supply chain; • Changes in our product mix; • Effect of competition;
• Our ability to cost-effectively expand and renovate existing facilities, open and manage new or acquired facilities, move production between manufacturing facilities, and/or any disruption at or near any of our facilities or other operations or those of our suppliers, distribution channel customers, mass retailers, or home centers where our products are sold; • Our ability to retain our executive officers or other key employees, attract and retain other qualified employees or successfully implement executive officer, key employee or other leadership or employee transitions and any failure by us, or our suppliers or distribution channel partners, to hire and/or retain a labor force to enhance existing products and develop and market new products, adequately staff manufacturing operations, perform service or warranty work or other necessary activities, or allow employees to adequately and safely perform their jobs; • Our inability to maintain appropriate inventory levels, including as a result of global supply chain disruptions, and if we underestimate or overestimate demand for our products, and the effect of inventory management decisions of our distribution channel customers;
• Changes in composition of, financial viability of, and the relationships with, our distribution channel customers; • Risks associated with our credit arrangements and ratings and any material change in the availability or terms of, or termination or disruption of, credit offered to our customers, distributors, and dealers; 3 Table of Contents • Risks associated with our international operations, including but not limited to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and compliance with foreign legal and regulatory requirements, the war between Ukraine and Russia and the related sanctions and geopolitical tensions, and other potential conflicts; • Our failure to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the effect of product quality issues, product liability claims, and other litigation to which we are or may be subject; • Risks associated with our acquisitions and alliances, joint ventures, investments, or partnerships and our failure to successfully complete divestitures or other restructuring activities; • Our ability to obtain and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or operate our business without infringing upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others; • Failure of our information systems or information security practices or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to adequately perform and/or protect sensitive or confidential information; • Our ability to achieve our financial projections or other business initiatives in the time periods that we anticipate or at all; • Changes in accounting or tax standards and policies and/or assumptions utilized in determining accounting tax estimates; and • Impact of increased scrutiny on our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and SEC rule making on ESG disclosures. For more information regarding these and other uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from what we have anticipated in our forward-looking statements or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, see our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors;" Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this report; and our subsequent filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements included in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement which speaks only as of the date made and to recognize that forward-looking statements are predictions of future results, which may not occur as anticipated. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks and uncertainties described above, the risks described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this report, and our subsequent SEC filings, as well as others that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate at this time. These risks and uncertainties are not exclusive and further information concerning the company and our businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect our financial results or condition, may emerge from time to time. We make no commitment to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect actual results, events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date any forward-looking statement is made, or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements. We advise you, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our future Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K we file with or furnish to the SEC. 4 Table of Contents PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "company," "TTC," "we," "our," or "us" refer to The Toro Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated from the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting primarily of recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented.
Due to seasonality within the industries in which the company's businesses operate, among other factors, operating results for the three months ended February 3, 2023 cannot be annualized to determine the expected results for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2023. The company’s fiscal year ends on October 31 and quarterly results are reported based on three-month periods that generally end on the Friday closest to the calendar quarter end. For comparative purposes, however, the company’s second and third quarters always include exactly 13 weeks of results so that the quarter end date for these two quarters is not necessarily the Friday closest to the calendar month end.
For further information regarding the company's basis of presentation, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
The policies described in that report are used for preparing the company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures, including disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales promotion and incentive accruals, incentive compensation accruals, income tax accruals, inventory valuation, warranty accruals, allowances for current expected credit losses, pension accruals, self-insurance accruals, legal accruals, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, useful lives for tangible and finite-lived intangible assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination or an asset acquisition, when applicable. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgments at the time they are made and are generally derived from management's understanding and analysis of the relevant and current circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial and other independent external third-party specialist valuations, when applicable. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, including the economic environment. Management adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual amounts could differ significantly from those estimated at the time the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2021-10,
Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance . The update increases the transparency of government assistance including annual disclosure of the types of assistance, an entity’s accounting for the assistance, and the effect of the assistance on an entity’s financial statements. The amended guidance will become effective for the company for the fiscal 2023 annual period. The company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The company believes that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements from the FASB that the company has not noted above will not have a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or do not apply to its operations. 9 Table of Contents 2 Business Combination Intimidator Group On January 13, 2022 ("the closing date"), during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company acquired the privately-held Intimidator Group ("Intimidator") for net aggregate purchase consideration of $ 399.8
million ("the purchase price"). Intimidator primarily designs, manufactures, markets, and sells a commercial-grade line of zero-turn mowers under the Spartan Mowers brand, which are intended to provide innovative turf management solutions to landscape contractors and other customers who require a commercial-grade solution. The acquisition of Intimidator broadened the company's Professional reportable segment and expanded its manufacturing footprint and dealer network. Purchase Accounting The company accounted for the acquisition in accordance with the accounting standards codification guidance for business combinations, whereby the purchase price was allocated to the acquired net tangible and intangible assets of Intimidator based on their fair values as of the closing date. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company completed its valuation of income taxes to finalize the purchase price allocation. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These fair values are based on internal company and independent external third-party valuations: (Dollars in thousands) January 13, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 975   Receivables 6,954   Inventories 34,608   Prepaid expenses and other current assets 513   Property, plant, and equipment 27,447   Right-of-use assets 344   Goodwill 163,731   Other intangible assets: Indefinite-lived trade name 99,100   Finite-lived trade names 3,260   Finite-lived customer-related 80,500   Finite-lived backlog 1,340   Accounts payable ( 8,535 ) Accrued liabilities ( 9,152 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 100 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 244 ) Total fair value of net assets acquired 400,741   Less: cash and cash equivalents acquired ( 975 ) Total purchase price $ 399,766   The goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the expected future cash flows, the value of the workforce, and expected synergies, including customer and dealer growth opportunities, expanding existing product lines, and cost reduction initiatives. Key areas of expected cost synergies include increased purchasing power for commodities, components, parts and accessories, and supply chain consolidation. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Intimidator was recognized within the company's Professional segment. The acquisition was considered an asset purchase for income tax purposes and as a result, the goodwill arising from the transaction is deductible. There were no purchase accounting adjustments recorded in fiscal 2023 that impacted the carrying value of goodwill acquired. Other Intangible Assets Acquired The allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired resulted in the recognition of $ 184.2  million of value for other intangible assets as of the closing date. The fair values of the acquired trade names, customer-related, and backlog intangible assets were determined using the income approach whereby an intangible asset's fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset. The useful lives of the other intangible assets were determined based on the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets adjusted as appropriate for entity-specific factors including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, and/or other factors that may limit the useful life of the respective intangible asset. As of the closing date, the acquired finite-lived intangible assets had a weighted average useful life of
9.5
years. The fair values of the trade names were determined using the relief from royalty method, which
10 Table of Contents is based on the hypothetical royalty stream that would be received if the company were to license the respective trade name and were based on expected future revenues from the respective trade name. The weighted-average useful life of the finite-lived trade name intangible assets was determined to be
9.8
years as of the closing date. The fair values of the customer-related and backlog intangible assets were determined using the excess earnings method and were based on the expected operating cash flows attributable to the respective intangible asset, which were determined by deducting expected economic costs, including operating expenses and contributory asset charges, from the revenue expected to be generated from the respective intangible asset. As of the closing date, the weighted-average useful life of the customer-related and backlog intangible assets were determined to be
9.6
years and
9
months, respectively. 3 Segment Data The company's businesses are organized, managed, and internally grouped into segments based on similarities in products and services. Segment selection is based on the manner in which the company's chief operating decision maker organizes segments for making operating and investment decisions and assessing performance. The company has identified
twelve
operating segments and has aggregated certain of those operating segments into
two
reportable segments: Professional and Residential. The aggregation of the company's segments is based on the segments having the following similarities: economic characteristics, types of products and services, types of production processes, type or class of customers, and method of distribution.

The company recognizes revenue over the term of the contract in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the performance obligations under the separately priced extended warranty and service contracts. For non-refundable customer deposits, the company recognizes revenue as of the point in time in which the performance obligation has been satisfied under the contract with the customer, which typically occurs upon change in control at the time a product is shipped. As of February 3, 2023 and October 31, 2022, $ 27.0
million and $ 28.0
million, respectively, of deferred revenue associated with outstanding separately priced extended warranty contracts, service contracts, and non-refundable customer deposits was reported within accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three months ended February 3, 2023, the company recognized $ 6.2  million of the October 31, 2022 deferred revenue balance within net sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") and average cost methods for certain of the company's inventories. All remaining inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method. As needed, the company records an inventory valuation adjustment for excess, slow-moving, and obsolete inventory that is equal to the excess of the cost of the inventory over the estimated net realizable value or market value for the inventory
14 Table of Contents depending on the inventory costing method. Such inventory valuation adjustment is based on a review and comparison of current inventory levels to planned production, as well as planned and historical sales of the inventory. The inventory valuation adjustment to net realizable value or market value establishes a new cost basis of the inventory that cannot be subsequently reversed. Inventories, net were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 October 31, 2022 Raw materials and work in process $ 498,283   $ 383,285   $ 482,884   Finished goods and service parts 803,027   584,274   738,097   Total FIFO and average cost value 1,301,310   967,559   1,220,981   Less: adjustment to LIFO value 169,872   135,487   169,872   Total inventories, net $ 1,131,438   $ 832,072   $ 1,051,109   8 Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net Property, plant, and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The company generally accounts for depreciation of property, plant, and equipment utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings and leasehold improvements are generally depreciated over
10
to
40
years, machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over
three
to
15
years, tooling is generally depreciated over
three
to
five years , and computer hardware and software and website development costs are generally depreciated over
two
to
five years . Expenditures for major renewals and improvements, which substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets, are capitalized. Costs associated with general maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred within cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings depending on the nature and use of the related asset. Interest is capitalized during the construction period for significant capital projects. Property, plant, and equipment, net was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 October 31, 2022 Land and land improvements $ 61,416   $ 57,924   $ 59,550   Buildings and leasehold improvements 327,731   326,137   324,343   Machinery and equipment 559,793   529,289   557,588   Tooling 226,961   221,646   225,865   Computer hardware and software 105,497   97,629   104,713   Construction in process 169,103   95,448   144,418   Property, plant, and equipment, gross 1,450,501   1,328,073   1,416,477   Less: accumulated depreciation 866,354   820,524   844,816   Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 584,147   $ 507,549   $ 571,661   9 Product Warranty Guarantees The company’s products are warranted to provide assurance that the product will function as expected and to ensure customer confidence in design, workmanship, and overall quality. Standard warranty coverage is generally provided for specified periods of time and on select products’ hours of usage and generally covers parts, labor, and other expenses for non-maintenance repairs. In addition to the standard warranties offered by the company on its products, the company also sells separately priced extended warranty coverage on select products for a prescribed period after the original warranty period expires. For additional information on the contract liabilities associated with the company's separately priced extended warranties, refer to Note 4,
Revenue . At the time of sale, the company recognizes expense and records an accrual by product line for estimated costs in connection with forecasted future warranty claims. The company's estimate of the cost of future warranty claims is based primarily on the estimated number of products under warranty, historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims, the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales, and the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim. The company periodically assesses the adequacy of its warranty accruals based on changes in these factors and records any necessary adjustments if the cost of actual claims experience indicates that adjustments to the company's warranty accrual are necessary. Additionally, from time to time, the company may also establish warranty accruals for its estimate of the costs necessary to settle major rework campaigns on a product-specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the major rework campaign become known and when the costs to satisfactorily address the situation are both probable and estimable. The
15 Table of Contents warranty accrual for the cost of a major rework campaign is primarily based on an estimate of the cost to repair each affected unit and the number of affected units expected to be repaired.
The changes in accrued warranties were as follows:   Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 Beginning balance $ 134,541   $ 116,783   Changes in accrual related to warranties during the period (1) 23,293   15,538   Acquisitions —   1,940   Payments made during the period (1) ( 18,750 ) ( 14,255 ) Changes in accrual related to pre-existing warranties 5,973   ( 146 ) Ending balance $ 145,057   $ 119,860   (1) Presentation of prior period changes in accrued warranties has been conformed to the current year presentation. There was no impact to the balance of accrued warranties in any period. 10 Investment in Joint Venture The company is party to a joint venture with Huntington Distribution Finance, Inc. ("HDF"), a subsidiary of The Huntington National Bank, established as Red Iron Acceptance, LLC ("Red Iron"), the primary purpose of which is to provide customer inventory financing to certain distributors and dealers of certain of the company’s products in the U.S. The company has also entered into a limited inventory repurchase agreement with Red Iron. For additional information regarding the customer financing aspect of the arrangement, as well as the limited inventory purchase agreement, refer to Note 14,
Commitments and Contingencies . The company owns
45
percent of Red Iron and HDF owns
55
percent of Red Iron. The company accounts for its investment in Red Iron under the equity method of accounting. The company and HDF each contributed a specified amount of the estimated cash required to enable Red Iron to purchase the company's floor plan financing receivables and to provide financial support for Red Iron's floor plan financing programs. Red Iron borrows the remaining requisite estimated cash utilizing an $ 800.0  million secured revolving credit facility established under a credit agreement between Red Iron and HDF. The company's total investment in Red Iron as of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022 and October 31, 2022 was $ 45.7
million, $ 24.1
million, and $ 39.3
million, respectively. The company has not guaranteed the outstanding indebtedness of Red Iron. 11 Stock-Based Compensation Compensation costs related to stock-based compensation awards were as follows: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 Stock option awards $ 1,711   $ 1,828   Performance share awards 818   1,621   Restricted stock unit awards 1,609   1,147   Unrestricted common stock awards 1,086   629   Total compensation cost for stock-based compensation awards $ 5,224   $ 5,225   Stock Option Awards Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of grant, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange. Options are generally granted to executive officers, other employees, and non-employee members of the company’s Board of Directors ("Board") on an annual basis in the first quarter of the company’s fiscal year but may also be granted throughout the fiscal year in connection with hiring, mid-year promotions, leadership transition, or retention, as needed and applicable. Options generally vest one-third each year over a
three-year
period and have a
ten-year
term but in certain circumstances, the vesting requirement may be modified such that options granted to certain employees vest in full on the
three-year
anniversary of the date of grant and have a
ten-year
term. Compensation cost equal to the grant date fair value determined under the Black-Scholes valuation method is generally recognized for these awards over the vesting period. Compensation cost recognized for other employees not considered executive officers and non-employee Board members is net of estimated forfeitures, which are determined at the time of grant based on historical forfeiture experience.
16 Table of Contents Stock options granted to executive officers and other employees are subject to accelerated expensing if the option holder meets the retirement definition set forth in the company's stock-based compensation plans. In that case, the fair value of the options is expensed in the fiscal year of grant because generally, if the option holder is employed as of the end of the fiscal year in which the options are granted, such options will not be forfeited but continue to vest according to their schedule following retirement. Similarly, if a non-employee Board member has served on the company's Board for
ten
full fiscal years or more, the awards will not be forfeited but continue to vest according to their schedule following retirement. Therefore, the fair value of the options granted is fully expensed on the date of the grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using various inputs and assumptions under the Black-Scholes valuation method. The expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk-free interest rate, stock price volatility, and dividend yield must be applied. The expected life is the average length of time in which executive officers, other employees, and non-employee Board members are expected to exercise their stock options, which is primarily based on historical exercise experience. The company groups executive officers and non-employee Board members for valuation purposes based on similar historical exercise behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on the daily movement of the company’s common stock over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on the company’s historical cash dividends paid, expected future cash dividends and dividend yield, and expected changes in the company’s stock price. The table below illustrates the weighted-average valuation assumptions used under the Black-Scholes valuation method for options granted in the first three months of the following fiscal periods:   Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Expected life of option in years 6.32 6.19 Expected stock price volatility 25.19 % 23.76 % Risk-free interest rate 3.79 % 1.30 % Expected dividend yield 0.95 % 0.93 % Per share weighted-average fair value at date of grant $ 33.23 $ 22.58 Performance Share Awards The company grants performance share awards to executive officers and other employees under which they are entitled to receive shares of the company’s common stock contingent on the achievement of performance goals of the company, which are generally measured over a
three-year
period. The number of shares of common stock a participant receives can be increased (up to
200
percent of target levels) or reduced (down to
zero ) based on the level of achievement of performance goals and will vest at the end of a
three-year
period. Performance share awards are generally granted on an annual basis in the first quarter of the company’s fiscal year. Compensation cost is recognized for these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the per share fair value, which is equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant, and the probability of achieving each performance goal. The per share weighted-average fair value of performance share awards granted during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $ 112.14
and $ 98.41 , respectively.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards Restricted stock unit awards are generally granted to certain employees who are not executive officers. Occasionally, restricted stock unit awards may be granted, including to executive officers, in connection with hiring, mid-year promotions, leadership transition, or retention. Restricted stock unit awards generally vest one-third each year over a
three-year
period, or vest in full on the
three-year
anniversary of the date of grant. Compensation cost equal to the grant date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized for these awards over the vesting period. The grant date fair value is equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares subject to the restricted stock unit awards and estimated forfeitures are determined on the grant date based on historical forfeiture experience. The per share weighted-average fair value of restricted stock unit awards granted during the first three months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $ 109.78
and $ 99.94 , respectively. Unrestricted Common Stock Awards During the first three months of fiscal 2023 and 2022,
10,329
and
6,453
shares, respectively, of fully vested unrestricted common stock awards were granted to certain Board members as a component of their compensation for their service on the Board and were recorded within selling, general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Additionally, the Company's Board members may elect to convert a portion or all of their calendar year annual retainers otherwise payable in cash into shares of the company's common stock.

("HCFC"), and other third-party financial institutions (collectively, the "financial institutions") which provide inventory financing to certain dealers and distributors of certain of the company's products in the U.S. and internationally. These financing arrangements are structured as an advance in the form of a payment by the financial institutions to the company on behalf of a distributor or dealer with respect to invoices financed by the financial institution. These payments extinguish the obligation of the dealer or distributor to make payment to the company under the terms of the applicable invoice. Under separate agreements between the financial institutions and the dealers and distributors, the financial institutions provide loans to the dealers and distributors for the advances paid by the financial institutions to the company. Under these financing arrangements, down payments are not required, and depending on the finance program for each product line, finance charges are incurred by the company, shared between the company and the distributor and/or the dealer, or paid by the distributor or dealer. The financial institutions retain a security interest in the distributors' and dealers' financed inventories and such inventories are monitored regularly through audits. Financing terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the inventory, which secures the indebtedness, is sold to end-users or when payment otherwise become due under the agreements between the financial institutions and the distributors and dealers, whichever occurs first. Rates are generally indexed to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), or an alternative variable rate, plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer. Rates may also vary based on the product that is financed. The net amount of receivables financed for dealers and distributors under this arrangement with Red Iron for the three months ended February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022 were $ 674.4
million and $ 528.1
million, respectively. The total amount of net receivables outstanding under this arrangement with Red Iron as of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022, and October 31, 2022 were $ 942.0
million, $ 494.6
million and $ 776.1
million, respectively. The total amount of receivables due from Red Iron to the company as of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022, and October 31, 2022 were $ 17.3
million, $ 28.1
million and $ 17.7
million, respectively. The net amount of receivables financed for dealers and distributors under the arrangements with HCFC and the other third-party financial institutions for the three months ended February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022 were $ 111.3
million and $ 106.5
million, respectively. As of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022, and October 31, 2022, $ 166.1
million, $ 220.0
million and $ 220.0
million of receivables financed by HCFC and the other third-party financial institutions were outstanding, respectively. Inventory Repurchase Agreements The company has entered into a limited inventory repurchase agreement with Red Iron and HCFC under which the company has agreed to repurchase certain repossessed products, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $ 7.5
million in a calendar year. Additionally, as a result of the company's floor plan financing agreements with the other third-party financial institutions, the company also entered into inventory repurchase agreements with the other third-party financial institutions. Under such inventory repurchase agreements, the company has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the other third-party financial institutions. As of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022 and October 31, 2022, the company was contingently liable to repurchase up to a maximum amount of $ 79.4
million, $ 172.3
million and $ 80.0
million, respectively, of inventory related to receivables under these inventory repurchase agreements. The company's financial exposure under these inventory repurchase agreements is limited to the difference between the amount paid to Red Iron, HCFC or other third-party financing institutions for repurchases of inventory and the amount received upon subsequent resale of the repossessed product. The company has repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory pursuant to such arrangements for the three months ended February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022. Litigation From time to time, the company is party to litigation in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are generally subject to uncertainties and to outcomes that are not predictable with assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time. Litigation occasionally involves claims for punitive, as well as compensatory, damages arising out of the use of the company’s products. Although the company is self-insured to some extent, the company maintains insurance against certain product liability losses. The company is also subject to litigation and administrative and judicial proceedings with respect to claims involving asbestos and the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment. Some of these claims assert damages and
19 Table of Contents liability for personal injury, remedial investigations or clean-up and other costs and damages. The company is also occasionally involved in commercial disputes, employment or employment-related disputes, and patent litigation cases in which it is asserting or defending against patent infringement claims. To prevent possible infringement of the company’s patents by others, the company periodically reviews competitors’ products. To avoid potential liability with respect to others’ patents, the company reviews certain patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices. The company believes these activities help minimize its risk of being a defendant in patent infringement litigation.
The company records a liability in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for costs related to claims, including future legal costs, settlements, and judgments, where the company has assessed that a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, the company records the most probable estimate of the loss or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. The company discloses a contingent liability even if the liability is not probable or the amount is not estimable, or both, if there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred. In the opinion of management, the amount of liability, if any, with respect to these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not materially affect the company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In situations where the company receives, or expects to receive, a favorable ruling related to a litigation settlement, the company follows the accounting standards codification guidance for gain contingencies. The company does not allow for the recognition of a gain contingency within its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the settlement of the underlying events or contingencies associated with the gain contingency. As a result, the consideration related to a gain contingency is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements during the period in which all underlying events or contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. 15 Leases The company enters into contracts that are, or contain, operating lease agreements for certain property, plant, or equipment assets utilized in the normal course of business, such as buildings for manufacturing facilities, office space, distribution centers, and warehouse facilities; land for product testing sites; machinery and equipment for research and development activities, manufacturing and assembly processes, and administrative tasks; and vehicles for sales, service, marketing, and distribution activities. Contracts that explicitly or implicitly relate to property, plant, and equipment are assessed at inception to determine if the contract is, or contains, a lease. Such contracts for operating lease agreements convey the company's right to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, an identified asset for a defined period of time in exchange for consideration. The lease term begins and is determined upon lease commencement, which is the point in time when the company takes possession of the identified asset, and generally includes all non-cancelable periods. Lease expense for the company's operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded within cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings as dictated by the nature and use of the underlying asset. The company does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, but does recognize expense on a straight-line basis, for short-term operating leases which have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset. Lease payments are determined at lease commencement and generally represent fixed lease payments as defined within the respective lease agreement or, in the case of certain lease agreements, variable lease payments that are measured as of the lease commencement date based on the prevailing index or market rate. Future adjustments to variable lease payments are defined and scheduled within the respective lease agreement and are determined based upon the prevailing market or index rate at the time of the adjustment relative to the market or index rate determined at lease commencement. Certain other lease agreements contain variable lease payments that are determined based upon actual utilization of the identified asset. Such future adjustments to variable lease payments and variable lease payments based upon actual utilization of the identified asset are not included within the determination of lease payments at commencement but rather, are recorded as variable lease expense in the period in which the variable lease cost is incurred. Right-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset throughout the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease agreement. The company accounts for operating lease liabilities at lease commencement and on an ongoing basis as the present value of the minimum remaining lease payments under the respective lease term. Minimum remaining lease payments are generally discounted to present value based the estimated incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable. Right-of-use assets are measured as the amount of the corresponding operating lease liability for the respective operating lease agreement, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, the remaining balance of any lease incentives received, unamortized initial direct costs, and impairment of the operating lease right-of-use asset, as applicable. 20 Table of Contents The following table presents the lease expense incurred on the company’s operating, short-term, and variable leases: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 Operating lease expense $ 6,074   $ 6,165   Short-term lease expense 868   1,415   Variable lease expense 25   —   Total lease expense $ 6,967   $ 7,580   The following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to the company's operating leases: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 Operating cash flows for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 6,170   $ 4,567   Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 1,892   $ 14,881   The following table presents other lease information related to the company's operating leases: February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 October 31, 2022 Weighted-average remaining lease term of operating leases in years 5.8 6.6 6.0 Weighted-average discount rate of operating leases 3.61   % 2.56   % 3.53   % The following table reconciles the total undiscounted future cash flows based on the anticipated future minimum operating lease payments by fiscal year for the company's operating leases to the present value of operating lease liabilities recorded within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 3, 2023: (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 2023 (remaining) $ 13,508   2024 18,455   2025 16,263   2026 10,801   2027 7,524   Thereafter 17,678   Total future minimum operating lease payments 84,229   Less: imputed interest 7,587   Present value of operating lease liabilities $ 76,642   16 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives
The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales to third-party customers, sales and loans to wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, costs associated with foreign plant operations, and purchases from suppliers. The company’s primary currency exchange rate exposures are with the Euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, and the Romanian new leu against the U.S. dollar, as well as the Romanian new leu against the Euro. To reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, the company enters into various derivative instruments to hedge against such risk, authorized under a company policy that places controls on these hedging activities, with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions. The company’s policy does not allow the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The company has also made an accounting policy election to use the portfolio exception with respect to measuring counterparty credit risk for derivative instruments and to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position with each counterparty. The company’s hedging activities primarily involve the use of forward currency contracts to hedge most foreign currency transactions, including forecasted sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. The company uses derivative instruments only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Decisions on whether to use such
21 Table of Contents derivative instruments are primarily based on the amount of exposure to the currency involved and an assessment of the near-term market value for each currency. The company recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedging instrument. Cash Flow Hedging Instruments The company formally documents relationships between cash flow hedging instruments and the related hedged transactions, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking cash flow hedging instruments. This process includes linking all cash flow hedging instruments to the forecasted transactions, such as sales to third-parties and costs associated with foreign plant operations, including purchases from suppliers. At the cash flow hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, the company formally assesses whether the cash flow hedging instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged transactions and whether those cash flow hedging instruments may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Changes in the fair values of the spot rate component of outstanding, highly effective cash flow hedging instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in other comprehensive income within AOCL on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the same period in which the cash flows of the underlying hedged transaction affect net earnings. Changes in the fair values of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized immediately in net earnings under the mark-to-market approach. The classification of gains or losses recognized on cash flow hedging instruments and excluded components within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings is the same as that of the underlying exposure. Results of cash flow hedging instruments, and the related excluded components, of sales and costs associated with foreign plant operations, including purchases from suppliers, are recorded in net sales and cost of sales, respectively. The maximum amount of time the company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted trade sales and purchases is
two years .
When it is determined that a derivative instrument is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a cash flow hedge, the company discontinues cash flow hedge accounting prospectively. The gain or loss on the dedesignated derivative instrument remains in AOCL and is reclassified to net earnings within the same Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings line item as the underlying exposure when the forecasted transaction affects net earnings. When the company discontinues cash flow hedge accounting because it is no longer probable, but it is still reasonably possible that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally expected period or within an additional
two-month
period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument remains in AOCL and is reclassified to net earnings within the same Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings line item as the underlying exposure when the forecasted transaction affects net earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional
two-month
period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were in AOCL are immediately recognized in net earnings within other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In all situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative instrument remains outstanding, the company carries the derivative instrument at its fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value within other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of February 3, 2023, the notional amount outstanding of forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments was $ 288.6
million. Derivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Instruments The company also enters into foreign currency contracts that include forward currency contracts to mitigate the remeasurement of specific assets and liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These contracts are not designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of hedges of recorded balance sheet positions, such as cash, receivables, payables, intercompany notes, and other various contractual claims to pay or receive foreign currencies other than the functional currency, are recognized immediately in other income, net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings together with the transaction gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. 22 Table of Contents The following table presents the fair value and location of the company’s derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 October 31, 2022 Derivative assets:       Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:       Prepaid expenses and other current assets       Forward currency contracts $ 7,757   $ 5,451   $ 27,733   Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Prepaid expenses and other current assets Forward currency contracts 2,852   1,491   5,523   Total derivative assets $ 10,609   $ 6,942   $ 33,256   Derivative liabilities: Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Accrued liabilities Forward currency contracts $ 1,345   $ —   $ —   Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Accrued liabilities Forward currency contracts 127   118   —   Total derivative liabilities $ 1,472   $ 118   $ —   The company entered into an International Swap Dealers Association ("ISDA") Master Agreement with each counterparty that permits the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective contracts. The ISDA Master Agreement is an industry standardized contract that governs all derivative contracts entered into between the company and the respective counterparty. Under these master netting agreements, net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable or receivable for contracts due on the same date or in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions. The company records the fair value of its derivative instruments at the net amount on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the accounting guidance for fair value measurements. The framework defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures. The framework discusses valuation techniques such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flows), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The framework utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 : Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 : Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. Recurring Fair Value Measurements The company's derivative instruments consist of forward currency contracts that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of such forward currency contracts is determined based on observable market transactions of forward currency prices and spot currency rates as of the reporting date. The following tables present, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022, and October 31, 2022, according to the valuation technique utilized to determine their fair values (dollars in thousands):   Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as: February 3, 2023 Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets:         Forward currency contracts $ 10,609   $ —   $ 10,609   $ —   Total assets $ 10,609   $ —   $ 10,609   $ —   Liabilities:         Forward currency contracts $ 1,472   $ —   $ 1,472   $ —   Total liabilities $ 1,472   $ —   $ 1,472   $ —     Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as: January 28, 2022 Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets:         Forward currency contracts $ 6,942   $ —   $ 6,942   $ —   Total assets $ 6,942   $ —   $ 6,942   $ —   Liabilities: Forward currency contracts $ 118   $ —   $ 118   $ —   Total liabilities $ 118   $ —   $ 118   $ —     Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as: October 31, 2022 Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets:         Forward currency contracts $ 33,256   $ —   $ 33,256   $ —   Total assets $ 33,256   $ —   $ 33,256   $ —   Liabilities:         Forward currency contracts $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   Total liabilities $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   25 Table of Contents Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements The company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include long-lived assets, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would generally be recorded at fair value as a result of an impairment charge. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination are also measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the measurement period allowed by the accounting standards codification guidance for business combinations when applicable. Alternatively, under a cost accumulation model, the company measures the fair values of net assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition before allocating the cost of the asset acquisition to the net assets acquired on the basis of their relative fair values. For additional information on the company's business combination and the related non-recurring fair value measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, refer to Note 2,
Business Combination . Other Fair Value Disclosures The carrying values of the company's short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt, when applicable, approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
As of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022, and October 31, 2022, the company's long-term debt included $ 524.1
million, $ 424.1
million, and $ 524.1
million of gross fixed-rate debt that is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations. The gross fair value of such long-term debt is determined using Level 2 inputs by discounting the projected cash flows based on quoted market rates at which similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed. As of February 3, 2023, the estimated gross fair value of long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $ 520.5
million compared to its gross carrying amount of $ 524.1
million. As of January 28, 2022, the estimated gross fair value of long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $ 499.1
million compared to its gross carrying amount of $ 424.1
million. As of October 31, 2022, the estimated gross fair value of long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $ 489.8
million compared to its gross carrying amount of $ 524.1
million. For additional information regarding long-term debt with fixed interest rates, refer to Note 6,
Indebtedness. 18 Subsequent Events The company has evaluated all subsequent events and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Mana gement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "company," "TTC," "we," "our," or "us" refer to The Toro Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. Unless expressly stated otherwise, the comparisons presented in this MD&A refer to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Our MD&A is presented as follows: • Company Overview • Results of Operations • Business Segments • Financial Position • Non-GAAP Financial Measures • Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This discussion contains various "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and we refer readers to the section titled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" located at the beginning of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Throughout this MD&A, we have provided financial and liquidity measures that are not calculated or presented in accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") ("non-GAAP financial measures," "adjusted" before specified financial measures, and "non-GAAP liquidity measures"), as information supplemental and in addition to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide investors with useful supplemental financial information to better understand our core operational performance and cash flows. These non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within this MD&A.

Our remaining activities are presented as "Other" due to their insignificance, as described in greater detail within the section titled "Business Segments"
in this MD&A. Acquisition of Intimidator Group On January 13, 2022 ("the closing date"), during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired the privately-held Intimidator Group ("Intimidator"). Intimidator primarily designs, manufactures, markets, and sells a commercial-grade line of zero-turn mowers under the Spartan Mowers brand, which are intended to provide innovative turf management solutions to landscape contractors and other customers who require a commercial-grade solution. The acquisition of Intimidator broadened our Professional reportable segment and expanded our manufacturing footprint and dealer network. The aggregate purchase consideration was $399.8 million. Subsequent to the closing date, Intimidator's results of operations have been included within our Professional reportable segment in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and had an incremental impact to our
27 Table of Contents Professional reportable segment net sales for the first twelve months post acquisition, or through the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For the three months ended February 3, 2023, Intimidator's results of operations had an incremental impact on our Professional segment net sales of $49.6 million. Intimidator's operations had an immaterial impact on Professional segment earnings for the three months ended February 3, 2023. For additional information regarding the acquisition, refer to Note 2,
Business Combination , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $1,148.8 million, up 23.2 percent compared to $932.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Professional segment net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $880.7 million, an increase of 30.9 percent compared to $672.9 million in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Residential segment net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $264.6 million, an increase of 3.6 percent compared to $255.4 million in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $106.9 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $69.5 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $103.6 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $69.7 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within this MD&A. We continued our history of paying quarterly cash dividends and increased our cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by 13.3 percent to $0.34 per share compared to $0.30 per share paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Field inventory levels were higher as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily driven by increased inventory costs resulting from inventory buildup to offset longer lead times and meet expected future demand, in addition to inflation. Our order backlog represents unfulfilled customer orders at a point in time. Our order backlog (including shipments beyond 12 months) was slightly higher as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 driven by continued strong demand. Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $1,148.8 million, up 23.2 percent compared to $932.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This net sales increase was primarily driven by higher volume, net price realization and the acquisition of Intimidator. Net sales in international markets increased by $50.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The international net sales increase for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was mainly driven by higher volume and net price realization. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in our net sales of approximately $6.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of consolidated net sales:   Three Months Ended February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 Net sales 100.0  % 100.0  % Cost of sales (65.5) (67.8) Gross profit 34.5  32.2  Selling, general and administrative expense (22.6) (22.4) Operating earnings 11.9  9.8  Interest expense (1.2) (0.8) Other income, net 0.7  0.3  Earnings before income taxes 11.4  9.3  Provision for income taxes (2.1) (1.8) Net earnings 9.3  % 7.5  % Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $395.9 million, up 31.8 percent compared to $300.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $396.1 million, up 31.8 percent compared to
28 Table of Contents $300.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Gross margin was 34.5 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 32.2 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 230 basis points. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to net price realization and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher material, freight, and manufacturing costs. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within this MD&A. Selling, General, and Administrative ("SG&A") Expense SG&A expense increased $50.6 million, or 24.3 percent, for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense increased 20 basis points for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter comparison was primarily due to higher warranty costs in certain of our Professional segment businesses, partially offset by net sales leverage. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $7.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This increase was driven by higher average outstanding borrowings under our debt arrangements and higher average interest rates. Other Income, Net Other income, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $6.5 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher income from our Red Iron joint venture and the favorable impact from derivative instruments. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 18.6 percent compared to 20.2 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first quarter was primarily due to higher tax benefits recorded as excess tax deductions for stock compensation in the current-year period compared to the same period of fiscal 2022. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 21.4 percent, compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.9 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Net Earnings Net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $106.9 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $69.5 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 53.0 percent per diluted share . Adjusted
net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $103.6 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $69.7 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 48.5 percent per diluted share. The increase in net earnings per diluted share for the first quarter comparison was primarily due to net price realization, higher Professional segment net sales volume, and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher material, freight, and manufacturing costs . Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP financial measures are included in the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within this MD&A. BUSINESS SEGMENTS We operate in two reportable business segments: Professional and Residential. Segment earnings for our Professional and Residential segments are defined as earnings from operations plus other income, net. Our remaining activities are presented as "Other" due to their insignificance. Operating loss for our Other activities included earnings (loss) from our wholly-owned domestic distribution company, Red Iron joint venture, corporate activities, other income, and interest expense. Corporate activities include general corporate expenditures, such as finance, human resources, legal, information services, public relations, and similar activities, as well as other unallocated corporate assets and liabilities, such as corporate facilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The following tables summarize net sales for our reportable business segments and Other activities:   Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 Dollar Value Change Percentage Change Professional $ 880,660  $ 672,885  $ 207,775  30.9  % Residential 264,615  255,402  9,213  3.6  Other 3,565  4,363  (798) (18.3) Total net sales* $ 1,148,840  $ 932,650  $ 216,190  23.2  % *Includes international net sales of: $ 245,337  $ 194,986  $ 50,351  25.8  % 29 Table of Contents The following tables summarize segment earnings for our reportable business segments and operating (loss) for our Other activities:   Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 Dollar Value Change Percentage Change Professional $ 144,076  $ 93,272  $ 50,804  54.5  % Residential 37,832  31,760  6,072  19.1  Other (50,594) (37,885) (12,709) (33.5) Total segment earnings $ 131,314  $ 87,147  $ 44,167  50.7  % Professional Segment Segment Net Sales Worldwide net sales for our Professional segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 30.9 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was driven primarily by higher shipments of product broadly across the segment, net price realization, and incremental revenue from our acquisition of Intimidator.
Segment Earnings Professional segment earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 54.5 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and Professional segment earnings margin increased to 16.4 percent from 13.9 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in Professional segment earnings margin was primarily due to net price realization, net sales leverage and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher material, freight, and manufacturing costs, and the addition of Intimidator at a lower initial earnings margin than the segment average.
Residential Segment Segment Net Sales Worldwide net sales for our Residential segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 3.6 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in Residential segment net sales for the first quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by net price realization and higher shipments of zero turn riding mowers, partially offset by lower shipments of snow products. Segment Earnings Residential segment earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 19.1 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and Residential segment earnings margin increased to 14.3 percent from 12.4 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in Residential segment earnings margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was largely driven by net price realization and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher material, freight, and manufacturing costs, and higher SG&A expense. Other Activities Other Net Sales Net sales for our Other activities included sales from our wholly-owned domestic distribution company less sales from the Professional and Residential segments to the distribution company. Net sales for our Other activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased by $0.8 million compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. This decrease was due to increased intercompany sales eliminations for sales from our Professional and Residential segments to the wholly-owned domestic distribution company, partially offset by higher sales by the wholly-owned domestic distribution company. Other Operating Loss The operating loss for our Other activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $12.7 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and was primarily due to higher corporate expenses and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher income from our Red Iron joint venture and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 30 Table of Contents FINANCIAL POSITION Working Capital Given the challenging macroeconomic environment that has created supply chain disruption and, more specifically, resulted in challenging conditions for sourcing adequate amounts of certain commodities, components, parts, and accessories, our working capital strategy continues to place primary emphasis on procuring key commodities, components, parts, and accessories when available in an attempt to maintain requisite inventory levels to meet our anticipated production requirements, avoid manufacturing delays, and meet the anticipated continued strong demand for our products, as well as attempting to ensure service parts availability for our customers. Accounts receivable as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $11.0 million, or 3.0 percent, compared to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher International sales, partially offset by lower Residential segment sales volume for certain customers in the last month of the quarter and a lower receivable from our Red Iron joint venture as a result of decreased sales financed under the joint venture near quarter-end. Inventory levels were up $299.4 million, or 36.0 percent, as of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher finished goods, work-in-process, and parts inventory driven by increased costs resulting from inflation and constrained component supply which limited finished product assembly. Accounts payable increased $0.7 million, or 0.2 percent, as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Cash Flow Cash Flows
from Operating Activities Cash used in operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2023 was $68.8 million compared to cash used in operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2022 of $90.0 million. This decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to higher net earnings, partially offset by increased cash consumed within inventory. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the first three months of fiscal 2023 was $22.0 million compared to cash used in investing activities for the first three months of fiscal 2022 of $413.4 million. This decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by cash used to acquire Intimidator in fiscal 2022, partially offset by higher purchases of property, plant, and equipment in the current fiscal year period. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for the first three months of fiscal 2023 was $74.4 million compared to cash provided by financing activities for the first three months of fiscal 2022 of $293.3 million. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities was mainly due to lower net borrowings, partially offset by lower share repurchases, in each case during the current fiscal year period compared to the prior fiscal year period. The net borrowings incurred during the prior fiscal year period were used in part to acquire Intimidator. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of February 3, 2023, we had available liquidity of $670.9 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $174.0 million, of which $75.5 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and availability under our revolving credit facility of $496.9 million. We believe our current liquidity position, including the funds available through existing, and potential future, financing arrangements and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to provide the necessary capital resources for our anticipated working capital needs,
payroll, and other administrative costs,
capital expenditures, lease payments, purchase commitments, contractual obligations, acquisitions, investments, establishment of new facilities, expansion and renovation of existing facilities, financing receivables from customers that are not financed with Red Iron or other third-party financial institutions, contingent consideration payments, debt repayments, interest payments, quarterly cash dividend payments, and common stock repurchases, all as applicable, for at least the next twelve months.

We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreements, indentures, and private placement note purchase agreements. Cash Dividends Our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 that was paid on January 11, 2023. This was an increase of 13.3 percent over our cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We curre ntly expe ct to continue paying our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders for the remainder of fiscal 2023. Share Repurchases During the first three months of fiscal 2023, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock. As of February 3, 2023, 7,526,606 shares remained available for repurchase under our Board authorized repurchase program. We expect to repurchase shares of our common stock throughout the remainder of fiscal 2023, depending on our cash balance, debt repayments, market conditions, our anticipated working capital needs, the price of our common stock, and/or other factors. Customer Financing Arrangements Our customer financing arrangements are described in further detail within our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to our customer financing arrangements during the first three months of fiscal 2023. Inventory Financing We are party to inventory financing arrangements with Red Iron, HCFC, and other third-party financial institutions which provide inventory financing to certain dealers and distributors of certain of our products in the U.S. and internationally. The net amount of receivables financed for dealers and distributors under the arrangement with Red Iron for the three month periods ended February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022 were $674.4 million and $528.1 million, respectively. The total amount of net receivables outstanding under the arrangement with Red Iron as of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022 and October 31, 2022 were $942.0 million, $494.6 million and $776.1 million, respectively. The total amount of receivables due from Red Iron to us as of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022 and October 31, 2022 were $17.3 million, $28.1 million and $17.7 million, respectively. The net amount of receivables financed for dealers and distributors under the arrangements with HCFC and the other third-party financial institutions for the three month periods ended February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022 were $111.3 million and $106.5 million, respectively. The total amount of net receivables outstanding under the arrangements with HCFC and the other third-party financial institutions as of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022, and October 31, 2022 were $166.1 million, $220.0 million, and $220.0 million, respectively. 32 Table of Contents Inventory Repurchase Agreements We have entered into a limited inventory repurchase agreement with Red Iron and HCFC under which we have agreed to repurchase certain repossessed products, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $7.5 million in a calendar year. Additionally, as a result of our financing agreements with the other third-party financial institutions, we have also entered into inventory repurchase agreements with the other third-party financial institutions. Under such inventory repurchase agreements, we have agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the other third-party financial institutions. As of February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022, and October 31, 2022, we were contingently liable to repurchase up to a maximum amount of $79.4 million, $172.3 million, and $80.0 million, respectively, of inventory related to receivables under these inventory repurchase agreements. Our financial exposure under these inventory repurchase agreements is limited to the difference between the amount paid to Red Iron, HCFC or other third-party financing institutions for repurchases of inventory and the amount received upon subsequent resale of the repossessed product. We have repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory pursuant to such arrangements for the three months ended February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022. However, a decline in retail sales or financial difficulties of our distributors or dealers could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase financed product, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We have provided in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the most directly comparable financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions and assessing liquidity because we believe they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our core operational performance and cash flows, as a measure of our liquidity, and provide us with a better understanding of how to allocate resources to both ongoing and prospective business initiatives. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to both our historical operating results and to our competitors' operating results by factoring out potential differences caused by charges and benefits not related to our regular, ongoing business, including, without limitation, certain non-cash, large, and/or unpredictable charges and benefits; acquisitions and dispositions; legal judgments, settlements, or other matters; and tax positions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide investors with useful supplemental financial information to better understand our core operational performance and cash flows. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies. 33 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following table provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial performance measures used in this report to the most directly comparable measures calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the

Acquisition-related costs for the three month period ended February 3, 2023 represent integration costs. Acquisition-related costs for the three month period ended January 28, 2022 represent transaction and integration costs incurred in connection with the acquisition. For additional information regarding the acquisition of Intimidator, refer to Note 2,
Business Combination , within the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 2     The accounting standards codification guidance governing employee stock-based compensation requires that any excess tax deduction for stock-based compensation be immediately recorded within income tax expense. Employee stock-based compensation activity, including the exercise of stock options, can be unpredictable and can significantly impact our net earnings, net earnings per diluted share, and effective tax rate. These amounts represent the discrete tax benefits recorded as excess tax deductions for stock-based compensation during the three month periods ended February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022. 34 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities
less purchases of property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from insurance claim. Free cash flow conversion percentage represents free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. We consider free cash flow and free cash flow conversion percentage to be non-GAAP liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and investors about our ability to convert net earnings into cash resources that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value, fund ongoing and prospective business initiatives, and strengthen our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, after reinvesting in necessary capital expenditures required to maintain and grow our business. The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP free cash flow and free cash flow conversion percentage to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the three month periods ended February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) February 3, 2023 January 28, 2022 Net cash used in operating activities $ (68,849) $ (90,043) Less: Purchases of property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from insurance claim 22,215  11,903  Free cash flow (91,064) (101,946) Net earnings $ 106,860  $ 69,510  Free cash flow conversion percentage (85.2) % (146.7) % CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. Refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", and Part II, Item 8, Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data , within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity costs. We are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. There have been no material changes to the market risk information regarding equity market risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. Refer to Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk", within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 for a complete discussion of our market risk. Refer below for further discussion on foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and commodity cost risk. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales to third-party customers, sales and loans to wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, costs associated with foreign plant operations, and purchases from suppliers. Our primary foreign currency exchange rate exposures are with the Euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, and the Romanian new leu against the U.S. dollar, as well as the Romanian new leu against the Euro. Because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the U.S. and Mexico, a stronger U.S. dollar and Mexican peso generally have a negative impact on our results from operations, while a weaker U.S. dollar and Mexican peso generally have a positive effect. To reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, we enter into various derivative instruments to hedge against such risk, authorized under a company policy that places controls on these hedging activities, with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions. Decisions on whether to use such derivative instruments are primarily based on the amount of exposure to the currency involved and an assessment of the near-term market value for each currency. Our worldwide foreign currency exchange rate exposures are reviewed monthly. The gains and losses on our derivative instruments offset the changes in values of the related underlying exposures. Therefore, changes in the values of our derivative instruments are highly correlated with changes in the market values of underlying hedged items both at inception and over the life of the derivative instrument. For additional information regarding our derivative instruments, see Note 16,
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , in our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 35 Table of Contents The foreign currency exchange contracts in the table below have maturity dates in fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025. All items are non-trading and stated in U.S. dollars. As of February 3, 2023, the average contracted rate, notional amount, fair value, and the gain (loss) at fair value of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows: (Dollars in thousands, except average contracted rate) Average Contracted Rate Notional Amount Fair Value Gain (Loss) at Fair Value Buy U.S. dollar/Sell Australian dollar 0.7123  $ 106,505  $ 105,545  $ (960) Buy U.S. dollar/Sell Canadian dollar 1.2873  40,628  41,763  1,135  Buy U.S. dollar/Sell Euro 1.1341  148,152  150,669  2,517  Buy U.S. dollar/Sell British pound 1.2815  40,430  41,644  1,214  Buy Mexican peso/Sell U.S. dollar 22.1863  $ 42,864  $ 48,095  $ 5,231  Our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars is not hedged. Any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and would not impact net earnings. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate risk relates primarily to fluctuations in variable interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreements, as well as the potential increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates. We generally do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. We have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to interest rate risks on our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations. Our indebtedness as of February 3, 2023 includes $524.1 million of gross fixed-rate long-term debt that is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations, $470.0 million of gross variable rate debt under our term loan credit agreements, and $100.0 million outstanding on our variable rate revolving credit facility. Commodity Cost Risk Most of the commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in our manufacturing process and end-products, or to be sold as standalone end-products, are exposed to commodity cost changes. These changes may be affected by several factors, including, for example, demand; inflation; deflation; changing prices; foreign currency fluctuations; tariffs; duties; trade regulatory actions; industry actions; and changes to international trade policies, agreements, and/or regulation and competitor activity, including antidumping and countervailing duties on certain products imported from foreign countries, such as certain engines imported into the U.S. from China. Our primary cost exposures for commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in our products are with steel, aluminum, petroleum, and natural gas-based resins, linerboard, copper, lead, rubber, engines, transmissions, transaxles, hydraulics, electrification components, and others. Our largest spend categories for commodities, components, parts, and accessories are generally steel, engines, hydraulic components, transmissions, resin, aluminum, and electrification components, all of which we purchase from several suppliers around the world. We generally purchase commodities, components, parts, and accessories based upon market prices that are established with suppliers as part of the purchase process and generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production and estimates of wholesale and retail demand for our products. In any given period, we strategically attempt to mitigate potential unfavorable impact as a result of changes to the cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories that affect our product lines through our productivity initiatives; however, our productivity initiatives may not be as effective as anticipated depending on macroeconomic cost trends for commodities, components, parts, and accessories costs and/or other factors. Our productivity initiatives include, but are not limited to, collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, SKU rationalization, utilizing Lean methods, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, and utilizing tariff exclusions and duty drawback mechanisms, all as appropriate. When appropriate, we may also increase prices on some of our products to offset changes in the cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories. To the extent that commodity and component costs increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers, or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices, and/or our productivity initiatives and/or product price increases are less effective than anticipated and/or do not fully offset cost increases, we may experience a decline in our gross margins. In the first three months of fiscal 2023, the average cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories purchased, including the impact of inflation and tariff costs, was higher compared to the average cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories purchased in the first three months of fiscal 2022. We anticipate that the average cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories purchased, including the impact of inflation and tariff costs, for the remainder of fiscal 2023 will be similar to the average costs experienced during the comparable period of fiscal 2022. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible internal controls. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of such period to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting On January 13, 2022, during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the acquisition of Intimidator. Prior to this acquisition, Intimidator was a privately-held company not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations of the SEC, or other corporate governance requirements to which public companies may be subject. In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the year of acquisition. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we are in the process of incorporating internal controls over significant processes specific to Intimidator that we believe are appropriate and necessary to account for the acquisition and to consolidate and report our financial res ults. We expect to complete our integration activities related to internal control over financial reporting for Intimidator during fiscal 2023. Accordingly, we expect to include Intimidator within our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023. With the exception of internal control related integration activities associated with our
acquisition of Intimidator, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three month period ended February 3, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 37 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are a party to litigation in the ordinary course of business, including claims for punitive, as well as compensatory, damages arising out of the use of our products; litigation and administrative and judicial proceedings with respect to claims involving asbestos and the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment; and commercial disputes, employment and employment-related disputes, and patent litigation cases.
