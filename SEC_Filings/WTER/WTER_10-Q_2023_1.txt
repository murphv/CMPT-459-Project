NOTES TO  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
NOTE 1 -NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business
The Company offers retail consumers bottled alkaline water in 500-milliliter, 700-milliliter, 1-liter, 1.5 -liter, 2,-liter, 3-liter and 1-gallon sizes, all of which is produced through an electrolysis process that uses specialized electronic cells coated with a variety of rare earth minerals to produce 8.8 pH drinking water without the use of any manmade chemicals. The Company also sells a line of Alkaline88® Sports Drinks and hemp-derived CBD bottled water under the brand name "Alkaline88CBD™". Our hemp-derived CBD bottled water is produced and sold in compliance with the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, Public Law 115-334).
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and stated in U.S. dollars, have been prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (a Nevada Corporation) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Alkaline 88, LLC (an Arizona Limited Liability Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Alkaline Water Company Inc. and Alkaline 88, LLC will be collectively referred herein to as the "Company". Any reference herein to "The Alkaline Water Company Inc.", the "Company", "we", "our" or "us" is intended to mean The Alkaline Water Company Inc., including its Alkaline 88, LLC subsidiary indicated above, unless otherwise indicated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be considered cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value. As of the balance sheet date and periodically throughout the period, the Company has maintained balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and periodically evaluates the credit worthiness of the financial institutions and has determined the credit exposure to be negligible. The Company had $ 2,192,867
and $ 1,531,062
in cash at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company generally does not require collateral, and the majority of its trade receivables are unsecured. The carrying amount for accounts receivable approximates fair value.
Accounts receivable consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022:
December 31,
March 31,
2022
2022
Trade receivables

( 640,000
)
( 470,000
)
Net accounts receivable
$
8,774,283
$
7,927,065
Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with clients. Provisions for losses on accounts receivable are determined on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. The accounts receivable balance is pledged as collateral for the Company's revolving financing as disclosed in Note 3.
Inventory
Inventory represents raw materials and finished goods valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the weight average method which approximates first-in first-out method, and with market defined as the lower of replacement cost or realizable value. The inventory balance is pledged as collateral for the Company's revolving financing as disclosed in Note 4.
As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, inventory consisted of the following:
December 31, 2022
March 31, 2022
Raw materials
$

Total inventory
$
8,737,717
$
8,583,664
As of March 31, 2022, the presentation in the table above has been corrected for a transposition error as the amounts for raw materials and finished goods.
Property and Equipment
The Company records all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. Improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line (half-life convention) method over the estimated useful life of the assets, which the Company has determined to be
3 years .
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718. Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and warrants and the closing price of the Company's common stock for common share issuances.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue per ASC 606. The Company recognizes revenue when the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. The Company's primary obligation (the distribution and sale of beverage products) is satisfied upon the delivery of products to the Company's customers, which is also when control is transferred. The Company does not accept returns due to the nature of the product. However, the Company will provide credit to our customers for damaged goods. The Company provides credit to its customers which typically require payment within 30 days. As an incentive to pay early the Company also typically provides a 2% discount if the customer pays within 10 days. The Company estimates the amount of the discount that the customer is likely to take and recognizes it as variable consideration. The amounts are not considered material. After evaluating the revenue disclosure requirements, the Company does not believe that any revenues are required to be disaggregated.
Revenue consists of the gross sales price, less variable consideration, consisting of estimated allowances for which provisions are made at the time of sale, and less certain other discounts, allowances, and rebates that are accounted for as a reduction from gross revenue. Shipping and handling charges that are billed to customers are included as a component of revenue. Costs incurred by the Company for shipping and handling charges are included in selling expenses and amounted to $ 3,021,744
and $ 4,105,279
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively and $ 10,555,978
and $ 11,824,231
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company's retail customers or distributors including, but not limited to the following: (a) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (b) reimbursements given to the Company's distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; and (c) the Company's agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; The Company's promotional allowance programs with its retailers or distributors are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year. The Company's promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with retailers and distributors, and accruals are established at the time of initial product sale for the Company's anticipated liabilities. The Company believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company's historical experience.

Income Taxes
The Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provision. This effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual pre-tax income (loss), permanent tax differences and statutory tax rates. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The differences relate principally to net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequence for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
Basic and diluted earnings or loss per share ("EPS") amounts in the consolidated financial statements are computed in accordance with ASC 260- 10 " Earnings per Share ", which establishes the requirements for presenting EPS. Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.
The Company had
8,679,234
and
4,033,949
shares relating to options and
1,805,000
and
780,009
shares relating to warrants at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively that were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were antidilutive.
Business Segments
The Company operates as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance. As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments including accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable approximate fair value due to the relative short period for maturity of these instruments.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow, market, or foreign-currency risks.
Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company's assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on reliability of the inputs as follows:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not have any financial instruments that are measured on a recurring basis as Level 1, 2 or 3.
Correction of Previously Issued Financial Statements
The accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2021 have been corrected for the following: an adjustment to reclassify Sales and marketing expenses of $ 2,010,352
for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and $ 4,795,278
for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 as a reduction of Revenue as such amounts were related to consideration payable to a customer which the Company subsequently  determined was not for distinct goods or services received. The Company assessed the materiality of the misstatement quantitatively and qualitatively and has concluded that the correction of the classification error is immaterial to the consolidated financials taken as a whole.
As a result of the correction, total Revenue decreased from $ 15,110,400
to $ 13,100,048
for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and from $ 44,479,743
to $ 39,684,465
for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 with a corresponding decrease of Gross Profit from $ 4,982,256
to $ 2,971,904
for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and from $ 14,949,173
to $ 10,153,895
for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The correction had no impact on Total operating loss or Net loss for either the three or nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Standards Required to be Adopted in Future Years.
The Company has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through December 31, 2022 and believes that none of them will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since its inception, the Company has been engaged substantially in developing its business plan and building its initial customer and distribution base for its products. As a result, the Company incurred accumulated net losses from Inception (June 19, 2012) through the period ended December 31, 2022 of ($ 129,410,274 ). In addition, the Company's development activities since inception have been financially sustained through debt and equity financing. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the of the date that the financial statements are issued.
The Company's cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company's daily operations. Management plans to raise additional funds by way of a private or ongoing public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy and its ability to generate sufficient revenue and to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Should the Company fail to raise additional capital, it may be compelled to reduce the scope of its planned future business activities.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to further implement its business plan, to generate sufficient revenue and to raise additional funds by way of public and/or private offerings.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company  be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 4 - REVOLVING FINANCING
On February 1, 2017, we entered into a credit and security agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with SCM Specialty Finance Opportunities Fund, L.P. ("SCM" or "Lender"), which subsequently changed its name to CNH Finance Fund I, L.P.
The Credit Agreement provides our company with a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"), the proceeds of which are to be used to repay existing indebtedness of our company, transaction fees incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement and for the working capital needs of our company.
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, SCM has agreed to make cash advances to our company in an aggregate principal at any one time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of (i) $10 million (the "Revolving Loan Commitment Amount") and (ii) the Borrowing Base (defined to mean, as of any date of determination, 85% of net eligible billed receivables plus 65% of eligible unbilled receivables, minus certain reserves).
The advanced under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2022 was $ 6,391,316 .
The Credit Agreement expires on July 3, 2023, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
The principal amount of the Revolving Facility outstanding bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal at all times to the rate of interest announced, from time to time, within Wells Fargo Bank at its principal office in San Francisco as its "prime rate," plus (ii) 3.25%, payable monthly in arrears. The interest rate as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 was 9.5% and 8.0%, respectively.
To secure the payment and performance of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, we granted to SCM a continuing security interest in all of our assets and agreed to a lockbox account arrangement in respect of certain eligible receivables.
The Company agreed to pay to SCM monthly an unused line fee in amount equal to
0.083 % per month of the difference derived by subtracting (i) the average daily outstanding balance under the Revolving Facility during the preceding month, from (ii) the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount. The unused line fee will be payable monthly in arrears. We also agreed to pay SCM as additional interest a monthly collateral management fee equal to
0.35 % per month calculated on the basis of the average daily balance under the Revolving Facility outstanding during the preceding month. The collateral management fee will be payable monthly in arrears. Upon a termination of the Revolving Facility, we agreed to pay SCM a termination fee in an amount equal to
1 % of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount if the termination occurs before July 3, 2023. We must also pay certain fees in the event that receivables are not properly deposited in the appropriate lockbox account.
The interest rate will be increased by
5 % in the event of a default under the Credit Agreement. Events of default under the Credit Agreement, some of which are subject to certain cure periods, include a failure to pay obligations when due, the making of a material misrepresentation to SCM, the rendering of certain judgments or decrees against our company and the commencement of a proceeding for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator or conservator or filing of a petition seeking reorganization or liquidation or similar relief.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and various affirmative and negative covenants including the right of first refusal to provide financing for our company and the financial and loan covenants, such as the loan turnover rate, minimum EBITDA, fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum liquidity requirements.
NOTE 5 - STOCKHOLDER EQUITY

The preferred stock may be divided into and issued in series, with such designations, rights, qualifications, preferences, limitations and terms as fixed and determined by our board of directors.
Series S Convertible Preferred Stock
On May 12, 2021, The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Endorsement Agreement (the "Endorsement Agreement"), with ABG-Shaq, LLC ("ABG-Shaq"), an entity affiliated with Shaquille O'Neal, for the personal services of Mr. O'Neal. Pursuant to the Endorsement Agreement, the Company received the right and license to use Mr. O'Neal's name, nickname, initials, autograph, voice, video or film portrayals, photograph, likeness and certain other intellectual property rights, in each case, solely as approved by ABG-Shaq, in connection with the advertising, promotion and sale of the Company's branded products. Mr. O'Neal will also provide brand ambassador services related to appearances, social media and public relations matters. The Endorsement Agreement also includes customary exclusivity, termination, and indemnification clauses.
As consideration for the rights and services granted under the Endorsement Agreement, the Company agreed to pay to ABG-Shaq aggregate cash payments of $ 3
million over the three years of the Endorsement Agreement. The Company will also pay expenses related to the marketing and personal services provided by Mr. O'Neal. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has paid $ 1,750,000
under this agreement. The Company will be paying $ 250,000
in each quarter in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.
In addition, the Company agreed to grant
6,681,090
shares of Series S Preferred Stock to ABG, each vested share of which is convertible into one share of the Company's common stock. The shares of Series S Preferred Stock will vest as to 1/3 on May 12, 2021, May 1, 2022, and May 1, 2023, respectively. The term of the Endorsement Agreement is three years, commencing on May 1, 2021 and terminating on May 1, 2024 (the " Term"). The Series S Preferred Stock was value at $ 6,681,090
based on the Company's closing stock price of $ 1.00
per share on May 12, 2021. The Company valued each annual vested Series S Preferred Stock in the amount of $ 2,227,030 , is being expensed over twelve months, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the expense relating to the Series S Preferred Stock was $ 556,758
and $ 1,670,273 , respectively.

for the year ended March 31,2023. In the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, the Company anticipates recognizing an expense in the amount of $ 3,227,030
and $ 185,586
respectively.
Series E Convertible Preferred Stock
On November 23, 2022, we entered into private placement subscription agreements, whereby we issued an aggregate of
1,100,000
shares of our Series E Preferred Stock ("Series E Preferred Stock") at a deemed price of $ 1.00
per share of Series E Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $ 1,100,000 . Pursuant to the subscription agreements, in consideration for the subscribers' execution and delivery of the subscription agreements, we also issued an aggregate of
880,000
shares of our common stock (the "Commitment Shares") at a deemed price of $ 0.25
per Commitment Share.
Holders of the Series E Preferred Stock (the "Holders") are entitled to receive dividends at the rate per share (as a percentage of the stated value per share) of
6 % per annum, payable on each anniversary date of the original issue date of shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by applicable Holders in a number of shares of our common stock per share of the Series E Preferred Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the dollar amount of such dividend payment by applicable market price. As of December 31, 2022 the company has a dividend payable of $ 5,500 .  A stated value of each share of the Series E Preferred Stock is $ 1.00 . Any accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock being converted will be paid in our common stock upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock. If we pay a dividend on our common stock while the shares of the Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Holders will be entitled to receive a dividend per share of Series E Preferred Stock equal to the dividend per share of our common stock. Such dividend will be payable on the same terms and conditions as the payment of the dividend on our common stock.
Each share of Series E Preferred Stock will be convertible, at any time after the date that is twelve months from the original issue date, at our option, into that number of units (each, a "Unit") determined by dividing the stated value of such share of Series E Preferred Stock by $ 0.25
(the "Conversion Price"). Each Unit will consist of one share of our common stock and one-half of one common stock purchase warrant with each whole common stock purchase warrant entitling the holder thereof to acquire one additional share of our common stock at an exercise price equal of 125% of the Conversion Price for a period of three years following the conversion date.
The Company identified the conversion into a Unit (one share of preferred stock and one-half warrant) as an embedded beneficial conversion feature (ASC 470), thus the Company valued (using Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and warrants) each component of the Unit.  The Warrant was valued at in the aggregate $ 211,470
and the Common Stock was valued at $ 888,530 .  Accordingly, during the three-months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an aggregate beneficial conversion feature of $ 211,470
upon issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock with a $ 211,470
increase in discount on preferred stock and a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital.  The value of the warrant is being amortized over 1 year (the period from issuance to the earliest allowable conversion date.  As of December 31, 2022, the discount on preferred stock was $ 193,847 .
A Holder may, at its option, at any time and from time to time after January 31, 2023, convert all, but no less than all, of shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such Holder into that number of Units determined by dividing the stated value of such shares of Series E Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price. Each share of the Series E Preferred Stock will automatically convert, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined below), into that number of Units determined by dividing the stated value of such share of Series E Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price.
The conversion right is subject to the beneficial ownership limitation, which will be 4.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock held by the applicable Holder. The Holder may increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitation upon not less than 61 days' prior notice to our company, but in no event will such beneficial ownership exceed 9.99%.
Except with respect to a Fundamental Transaction, as required by law, or as required by the articles of incorporation of our company, the Holders and the holders of our common stock will be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting and to vote as a single class upon any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote, on the following basis: (i) holders of our common stock will have one vote per share of our common stock held by them; and (ii) holders of Series E Preferred Stock will have one vote per share of Series E Preferred Stock held by them. With respect to a Fundamental Transaction, the Holders will be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting and to vote as a separate class and will have one vote per share of Series E Preferred Stock by them. A Fundamental Transaction means (i) any merger or consolidation of our company with or into another entity (but excluding a merger effected solely for the purpose of changing the jurisdiction of the incorporation of our company or changing the name of our company or liquidating, dissolving or winding-up one or more subsidiaries of our company), (ii) any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of our company's assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by our company or another individual or entity) is completed pursuant to which holders of our common stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or (v) one or more related transactions consummating a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another individual or entity or group of individuals or entities whereby such other individual or entity or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (not including any shares of common stock held by the other individual or entity making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other individual or entity making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination).
Common Stock
On March 4, 2022, the Company entered into private placement subscription agreements, whereby it issued unsecured convertible notes (the "Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $ 3.8
million.
The Notes were to mature on September 4, 2022
and accrue interest at
8 % per annum, which interest will be payable on the date of the maturity. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, the holders of the Notes may convert all or any part of the principal amount outstanding under the Notes into units (the "Conversion Units") at a conversion price of $ 0.80
per Conversion Unit. Each Conversion Unit will consist of one share of the Company's common stock and one share purchase warrant. Each share purchase warrant would entitle the holder thereof to acquire one share of the Company's common stock at a price of $1.10 per share until March 4, 2025.
Pursuant to the aforementioned subscription agreements, in consideration for the subscribers' execution and delivery of the subscription agreements, the Company issued an aggregate of
475,000
shares which the Company recognized a debt discount in the amount of $ 345,455
which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized interest expense in connection with the amortization of the debt discount of $ 121,619
and $ 294,346 , respectively.
In addition, the Company recognized a beneficial conversion feature in connection with the warrants in the amount of $ 1,524,750
which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized interest expense in connection with the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature of $ 542,133
and $ 1,304,508 , respectively.
On July 25, 2022, the Company entered into debt settlement agreements the holders of the Notes in which the Company issued
10,459,354
common shares in settlement of the Company's Notes in an aggregate amount of $ 3,869,962
(principal of $ 3,800,000
and accrued and unpaid interest of $ 69,962 ) at settlement price per share of $ 0.37 . The original conversion price per share of the Notes was $ 0.80
per share and the stock price at the date of the debt settlement was $ 0.429
per share. The settlement of the debt at $ 0.37
per share resulted in a non-cash debt settlement expense of $ 2,405,612 .
Upon conversion of the Notes, the holders of the Notes received warrants to purchase
10,459,354
common shares in the Company at $ 1.10
per share. The Company lowered the warrant exercise price from $ 1.10
to $ 0.44
for thirty days. The holders of the Notes exercised all of the warrants, resulting in the Company receiving net proceeds of $ 4,602,116
and the issuance of
10,459,354
shares of its common stock. In connection with this exercise of the warrants, the Company expensed the unamortized amount of the above referenced beneficial conversion feature recognized in connection with the issuance of the warrants.
Share Issuances
Effective as of August 29, 2022, we issued an aggregate of
2,285,714
shares of our common stock upon exercise of our common stock purchase warrants with an exercise price of $ 0.46
per share for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $ 1,051,428 .  These warrants had an original exercise price of $ 1.25
per share.  The Company reduced the exercise price of these warrants from $ 1.25  to $ 0.46  per share for a period of 30 days, commencing on August 9, 2022, in order to entice the holders of these warrant to exercise their warrants.  Klutch Financial Corp., a company wholly owned by Aaron Keay, a director of the Company, exercised their
1,000,000
warrants during the aforementioned period allowed for the exercise price reduction.  The Company received net proceeds of $ 460,000
in connection with the exercise of these
1,000,000  warrants by Klutch Financial Corp.

On November 16, 2022, we granted an award of
2,550,000
shares of our common stock as a "restricted award" under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan to certain directors, officers and employees of the Company. Of these restricted awards:

900,000  shares of our common stock pursuant to our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. Each stock option is exercisable at a price of US$ 0.25  per share until November 16, 2032. All of these stock options vest 50% on each of the first and second anniversary of their grant date.  The Company valued the stock options (using Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and warrants) at an implied price of $ 0.22
or an aggregate value of $ 194,400
which will be expensed over the 2-year vesting period.  The Company recorded an expense of $ 8,100

Forfeiture of Options
During the quarter, there were
948,000
options from 11 holders that were forfeited due to the Company’s reduced headcount. The forfeiture of these options resulted in a reversal of prior stock option expense in the amount of $ 394,044 .  In addition, on November 16, 2022, the Company cancelled a previously issued granted to Mr. Aaron Keay, a director of the Company, of
750,000
stock options.  The Company reversed the prior expense of $ 14,187

NOTE 7 - LEASES
As of October 1, 2020, the company entered into a lease for
9,166
square feet of corporate office and warehouse space from a third party through September 2023 at a rate of $ 10,083
per month for the first twelve months, then at a rate of $ 10,385
for the next 12 months, and $ 10,697
for the final 12 months of the lease. The Company determined this lease was an operating lease under ASC 842 and using an interest rate of
7 %, the Company determined that the ROU for this lease was $ 337,932
and the lease liability for this lease was $ 337,932 , at inception of this lease, respectively. Previously, the Company leased its corporate office space with a size of
3,352
square feet leased from a third party which leased through November 2020 at the current rate of $ 7,891
per month.
As of November 1, 2020, the company entered into a lease for
2,390
square feet of corporate office space from a third party through January 2024 at a rate of $ 5,280
per month for the first twelve months starting January 2021, then at a rate of $ 5,377
for the next 12 months, and $ 5,497
for the final 13 months of the lease. The Company determined this lease was an operating lease under ASC 842 and using an interest rate of
7 %, the Company determined that the ROU for this lease was $ 177,629
and the lease liability for this lease was $ 177,629 , at inception of this lease, respectively.
As of April 1, 2022, the Company entered into a lease for
1,520
square feet of warehouse space from a third party through March 2025 at a rate of $ 1,812
per month for the first twelve months, then at a rate of $ 1,867
per month for the last next twelve months and then at a rate of $ 1,923
for the last twelve months. The Company determined this lease was an operating lease under ASC 842 and using an interest rate of
7 %, the Company determined that the ROU for this lease was $ 60,737
and the lease liability for this lease was $ 60,737 , at inception of this lease, respectively.
At inception the ROU and Lease Liability was calculated based on the net present value of the future lease payments over the term of the lease. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease discount payments as the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the net present value; however, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for our corporate office lease. In this case, the Company estimated its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate it could borrow an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term, with similar collateral as the lease, and in a similar economic environment. The Company estimated its rate using available evidence such as rates imposed by third-party lenders to the Company in recent financings or observable risk-free interest rate and credit spreads for commercial debt of a similar duration, with credit spreads correlating to the Company's estimated creditworthiness.
For operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, the Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the date it takes possession of the leased property. The Company records the straight-line lease expense and any contingent rent, if applicable, in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The corporate office, lease also requires the Company to pay real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs and other occupancy costs which are included in the general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Operating Lease expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 66,563
and $ 188,094 , respectively. Operating lease expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 was $ 92,481
and $ 285,007 , respectively.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This report contains "forward-looking statements." All statements other than statements of historical fact are "forward-looking statements" for purposes of applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objections of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements may include the words "may," "could," "estimate," "intend," "continue," "believe," "expect" or "anticipate" or other similar words. These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward- looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and Canada, we do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. The factors impacting these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: • lack of working capital; • inability to raise additional financing; • the fact that our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require our management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain; • deterioration in general or regional economic conditions; • adverse state or federal legislation or regulation that increases the costs of compliance, or adverse findings by a regulator with respect to existing operations; • inability to efficiently manage our operations; • inability to achieve future sales levels or other operating results; and • the unavailability of funds for capital expenditures. Unless otherwise indicated, all reference to "dollars", "$", "USD" or "US$" are to United States dollars and all reference to "CDN$" are to Canadian dollars. Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars ($ or US$) unless otherwise stated and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all references to "common shares" refer to the common shares in our capital stock. As used in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the terms "we", "us" "our", the "Company" and "Alkaline" refer to The Alkaline Water Company Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alkaline 88, LLC (an Arizona Limited Liability Company), unless otherwise specified. COVID-19 Our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the outbreak of COVID-19. To date, we have managed to operate successfully throughout the pandemic without any material disruptions to our supply chain. Although retailers which carry our products may be considered essential businesses and therefore be allowed to remain operational, they may experience significantly reduced demand. The risk of a pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including retail properties, and could cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory to our customers. Further, such risks could also adversely affect retail customers' financial condition, resulting in reduced spending on our products, which are marketed as premium products. "Shelter-in-place" or other such orders by governmental entities could also disrupt our operations, if our employees or the employees of our sourcing partners who cannot perform their responsibilities from home, are not able to report to work. Risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our co-packing facilities or operations of our sourcing partners. Inflationary Pressure We have seen significant margin contraction as a result of inflationary pressures over the last 12 months. We've taken a number of steps that will allow us to increase our margins in the year ended March 31, 2023. These steps include (1) an approximate 9% across the board price increase (effective across all banners for the entire fiscal 2023); (2) a potential leveling off or small reduction in freight costs due to the geographic distribution of our new co-packers and suppliers; and (3) our buying power allowing us to lock in price breaks on raw materials over the next 12 months. Results of Operations Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Our results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows :     For the three     For the three       months ended     months ended       December 31,     December 31,       2022     2021   Revenue $ 15,874,967   $ 13,100,048   Cost of goods sold   11,947,892     10,128,144   Gross profit $ 3,927,075   $ 2,971,904                 Net Loss $ (3,986,455 ) $ (10,736,033 ) Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold We had revenue from sales of our product for the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $15,874,967 as compared to $ 13,100,048  for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 21% generated by sales of our alkaline water and flavored infused water.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital     At December     At March 31,       31, 2022     2022   Current assets $ 22,225,650   $ 21,157,421   Current liabilities   22,902,412     21,920,686   Working capital $ (676,762 ) $ (763,265 ) Current Assets Current assets as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 primarily relate to $2,192,867 and $1,531,062 in cash, $8,774,283 and $7,927,065 in accounts receivable and $8,737,717 and $8,583,664 in inventory, respectively. Current Liabilities Current liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 primarily relate to $14,109,479 and $10,441,879 in accounts payable which increased due to lower balance on the revolver credit line and continued operating loss, revolving financing of $6,391,316 and $7,043,870, and accrued expenses of $2,225,366 and $2,036,739 respectively. Cash Flows Our cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows:     For the nine     For the nine       months     Months       ended     ended       December     December       31,     31,       2022     2021   Net cash used in operating activities $ (9,919,960 ) $ (25,940,267 ) Net cash used in investing activities   (787,817 )   (493,392 ) Net cash provided by financing activities   11,369,582     20,595,932   Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 661,805   $ (5,837,664 ) Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $9,919,960 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $25,940,267 used in operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of approximately $16 million in net cash used in operating activities is primarily due to approximately $8.7 million decrease of net loss in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 and an increase in accounts payable of approximately $2.9 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $787,817 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $493,329 used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $11,369,582, as compared to $20,595,932 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of approximately $9.2 million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to decrease of approximately $7.7 million of proceeds provided by the exercise of warrants. Cash Requirements Our ability to continue operating as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. We have initiated a cost-reduction strategy, which along with our cash on hand, plus anticipated warrant exercises and debt settlements, our line of credit and the sales agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC is planned to fund our current planned operations and capital needs. However, if our current plans change or are accelerated or we choose to increase our production capacity, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities, including seeking investments from strategic investors. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition – Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; reimbursements given to the Company’s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; the Company’s agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities Promotional allowance - The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures", as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company's reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated our company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management identified the following material weaknesses: (1) we had inadequate segregation of duties over both financial reporting and closing activities, (2) we had inadequate resources in the accounting department, (3) delays in the implementation of a new ERP accounting system which caused the system to not function as intended and as a result led to delays in our financial closing activities.  In response to the material weaknesses discussed above, we are working on implementing a new integrated ERP system and have hired additional accounting personnel in December 2022. Once the ERP system in fully implemented within the next three months, we plan to engage a third-party consultant to develop a comprehensive control framework using the ERP and to document our internal controls based on the implementation of the ERP system. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional improvements as necessary. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
