ORGANIZATION
Parks!
America, Inc. (“Parks!” or the “Company”) owns and operates through wholly owned subsidiaries three regional
theme parks and is in the business of acquiring, developing and operating local and regional theme parks and attractions in the United
States. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc. a Georgia corporation (“Wild Animal –
Georgia”), Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation (“Wild Animal – Missouri”), and Aggieland-Parks, Inc., a
Texas corporation (“Aggieland Wild Animal – Texas”). Wild Animal – Georgia owns and operates the Wild Animal
Safari theme park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the “Georgia Park”). Wild Animal – Missouri owns and operates the Wild
Animal Safari theme park located in Strafford, Missouri (the “Missouri Park”). Aggieland Wild Animal – Texas owns and
operates the Aggieland Wild Animal Safari theme park near Bryan/College Station, Texas (the “Texas Park”). The Company acquired
the Georgia Park on June 13, 2005, the Missouri Park on March 5, 2008, and the Texas Park on April 27, 2020.
The
Company was originally incorporated on
July 30, 1954
as Painted Desert Uranium & Oil Co., Inc. in Washington State. On October 1,
2002, Painted Desert Uranium & Oil Co., Inc. changed its name to Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. and its corporate domicile to the
State of
Nevada . On December 19, 2003, Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. acquired the assets of Great Western Parks LLC pursuant to a Share
Exchange Agreement that resulted in the Company assuming control and changing the corporate name to Great American Family Parks, Inc.
The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which Great Western Parks was considered the acquirer of Royal Pacific
Resources for reporting purposes. On June 11, 2008, the Company changed its name from Great American Family Parks, Inc. to Parks! America,
Inc.
The
Company’s Parks are open year-round, but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March
through early September. Combined third and fourth quarter attendance based net sales were 62.1% and 60.3% of annual attendance based
net sales for the Company’s 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, respectively.
COVID-19
Considerations
In
response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities throughout the United States implemented a variety of containment
measures with the objective of slowing the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns.
The Company implemented several measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on our business and financial position. During the initial
shutdown period, the Company reduced staffing, applied for and received Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans and reduced
discretionary spending. In addition, the Company delayed closing the Texas Park acquisition to renegotiate various terms, primarily focused
on reducing the cash requirements of the acquisition in the subsequent year.
In
early April 2020, the Company’s Georgia and Missouri Parks closed to the public due to shelter-in-place mandates. In addition,
the Company’s Texas Park, was closed to the public for the month prior to its acquisition, due to a shelter-in-place mandate. In
compliance with respective state issued guidelines, each of the Company’s parks reopened in early May 2020. After reopening, attendance
levels increased significantly at each of the Company’s parks for the balance of its 2020 fiscal year, which continued throughout
its 2021 fiscal year in comparison to comparable pre-COVID-19 periods. While attendance based net sales remain higher compared to comparable
pre-COVID-19 periods, the Company experienced a decline in comparable year-over-year attendance based net sales and attendance for the
last 22 weeks of its 2021 fiscal year and for its entire 2022 fiscal year, respectively.
As
the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates, the Company’s future operations are dependent on factors outside of management’s knowledge
or control, including the duration and severity of this pandemic or similar public health risks. Although we have experienced attendance
gains and strong cash flows subsequent to reopening our parks after the initial closures at the beginning of the pandemic, there may
be longer-term negative impacts to the Company’s business, results of operations and cash flows, and financial condition as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative impacts may include changes in customer behavior and preferences, increases in operating expenses
to meet consumer expectations and perceptions, limitations in our ability to recruit and maintain staffing, as well as increasing wages
required to retain and recruit staff. There is also the potential for attendance levels at our parks to moderate or decline as alternative
entertainment venues are now open and consumers have broader travel and entertainment options. There is also the possibility that one,
or a combination of these risk factors, may have a material negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, cash
flows, and financial condition.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation :
The Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 and
for the three months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. The Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The information reflects
all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations
for the periods set forth herein. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year. These unaudited
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.
Principles
of Consolidation :
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries (Wild Animal – Georgia, Wild Animal – Missouri and Aggieland Wild Animal – Texas). All material inter-company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Accounting
Method :
The Company recognizes income and expenses based on the accrual method of accounting.
Estimates
and Assumptions :
Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Those estimates
and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the
reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements.
Fiscal
Year End :
The Company’s fiscal year-end is the Sunday closest to September 30, and its quarterly close dates are also determined
by the Sunday closest to the end of each quarterly reporting period. For the 2023 fiscal year, October 1 will be the closest Sunday,
and for the 2022 fiscal year, October 2 was the closest Sunday. This fiscal calendar aligns the Company’s fiscal periods closely
with the seasonality of its business. The high season typically ends after the Labor Day holiday weekend. The period from October through
early March is geared towards maintenance and preparation for the next busy season, which typically begins at Spring Break and runs through
Labor Day.
Financial
and Concentrations Risk :
The Company does not have any significant concentration or related financial credit risks. The Company
maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits.
Fair
Value :
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants, or an exit price. Inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value may be observable or unobservable,
and valuation techniques used to measure fair value should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels based on the ranks of the quality and reliability of inputs used to determine
the fair values. Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs consist
of quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally
from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant
inputs or value drivers are unobservable. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value
on a recurring basis include our term debt.
Accounts Receivable :
The theme parks are a payment upfront business; therefore, the Company typically carries little or no accounts
receivable. The Company had $ 3,335
and $ 4,405
of accounts receivable as of January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively.
Inventory :
Inventory consists of gift shop items, animal food, and concession and park supplies, and is stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method. The gross profit method is used to determine the change in gift
shop inventory for interim periods. Inventories are reviewed and reconciled annually because inventory levels turn over rapidly. The
Company had inventory of $ 542,147
and $ 541,986
as of January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively.

Revenue
Recognition :
The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC 606,
Revenues from Contracts with Customers . Under
ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the
consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements
that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract
with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocation the
transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance
obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is
entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
Revenues
from park admission fees are recognized at the point in time control transfers to the customer, which is generally when the customer
accepts access to the park and the Company is entitled to payment. Park admission revenues for annual passes and memberships are deferred
and recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis over the term of the pass or membership. Park admission fee revenues from advance online
ticket purchases are deferred until the customers’ visit to the parks. Advance online tickets can generally be used anytime during
the one year period from the date of purchase. Revenues from retail and concession sales are generally recognized upon the concurrent
receipt of payment and delivery of goods to the customer. Sales taxes billed and collected are not included in revenue.
Deferred
revenues from advance online admission tickets, and season passes, and memberships were $ 172,199
and $ 193,912
as of January 1, 2023 and
October 2, 2022, respectively, and is included within Other Current Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The
Company periodically sells surplus animals created from the natural breeding process that occurs within the parks. All animal sales are
reported as a separate revenue line item. Animal sales are recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer, which
is generally determined when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which generally occurs upon delivery of the
animal. Based on the Company’s assessment of control indicators, sales are recognized when animals are delivered to the customer.
The
Company provides disaggregation of revenue based on geography in “ Note 8: Business Segments ”,
as it believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
Advertising
and Marketing Costs :
The Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as incurred. Advertising and marketing expense for
the three months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 totaled $ 205,435
and $ 307,873 , respectively.
Leases :
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and accounts for all leases in accordance with ASC 842,
Leases . If an arrangement contains a lease, the Company performs a classification test to determine if the lease is an operating
lease or a financing lease. Right of use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities
represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets are valued at the initial measurement of
the lease liability, plus any indirect costs or rent prepayments, and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments.
Right of use assets are amortized over the lease term. Lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date of the lease based on
the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the future
lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, unless the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. Lease
terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, unless management believes there is an alternative systematic
basis which better represents the pattern which the Company will consume the economic benefits thereof and is included within general
and administrative expenses. As a practical expedient, the Company does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases
with an original term of one year or less. Any non-lease components are not included within the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability,
are reflected as an expense in the period incurred.
In
October 2021, the Company entered a financing lease for certain property related to a Christmas Lights drive through display at its Missouri
Park. Effective September 27, 2022, the Company terminated this financing lease, acquiring the leased property related to the Christmas
Lights display for $ 85,000
in exchange for a mutual release of obligations under the lease agreement and recognized a lease termination
gain of $ 2,011 . During the three months ended January 2, 2022 the Company recognized right of use asset amortization and interest expense
related to this lease of $ 154,831
and $ 2,011 , respectively.

Stock
Based Compensation :
The Company recognizes stock based compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period associated with the grant. The Company awards shares to its Board of Directors for service on the Board. The shares issued to
the Board are “restricted” and are not to be re-sold unless an exemption is available, such as the exemption afforded by
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company recognizes the expense
based on the fair market value at time of the grant. The Company typically awards its annual Director compensation around the end of
each calendar year.
A
Stock Option and Award Plan (the “Plan”) providing for incentive stock options and performance bonus awards for executives,
employees, and directors was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on February 1, 2005, however, the Plan has not been submitted
to the stockholders for approval. The Plan sets aside five million ( 5,000,000 ) shares for award of stock options, including qualified
incentive stock options and performance stock bonuses. To date,
no
grants or awards have been made pursuant to the Plan and the Company
did not submit the Plan for consideration to the Company’s stockholders at its last meeting of stockholders.
Income
Taxes :
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting basis
and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. Management periodically reviews
the Company’s deferred tax assets to determine whether their value can be realized based on available evidence. A valuation allowance
is established when management believes it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized. Changes in valuation
allowances from period to period are included in the Company’s income tax provision in the period of change.
The
Company follows the guidance in FASB ASC 740 with respect to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. A tax position is recognized
as a benefit only if it is “more-likely-than-not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax
examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely
of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more-likely-than-not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.
The Company has no unrecognized tax benefits under guidance related to tax uncertainties. The Company does not anticipate the unrecognized
tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. Any tax penalties or interest expense will be recognized in income
tax expense.
No
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were accrued as of January 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022.
Basic
and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share :
Basic net income (loss) per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average
number of shares actually outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number of
common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding as if shares had been issued on the exercise any common share rights unless the
exercise becomes anti-dilutive.
Basic
and diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the applicable
weighted average number of common shares outstanding in each period.
Dividend
Policy :
The Company has not yet adopted a policy regarding payment of dividends.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements :
Credit
Losses – Financial Instruments
In
June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic
326) , which changes the impairment model for most financial assets to require measurement and recognition of expected credit losses
for financial assets held, replacing the existing incurred loss model. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2022, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, however,
it is not anticipated to be material.
Except
as noted, the Company does not expect recently issued accounting standards or interpretations to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations, cash flows or financial statement disclosures.

principal amount of $ 1.95
million (the “2021 Term Loan”). The 2021 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of
3.75 % per annum
and is
payable in monthly installments
of approximately $ 26,480 , based on a seven-year amortization period. The 2021 Term Loan has a
maturity date of
June 18, 2028 . The 2021 Term Loan is secured by a security deed on the assets of Wild Animal – Georgia. The Company
paid a total of approximately $ 1,514

The 2020 Term Loan is secured by substantially all the Aggieland Wild Animal – Texas assets, as well as guarantees from the Company
and its subsidiaries. The 2020 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of
5.0 % per annum, has a maturity date of
April 27, 2031 , and required
interest only monthly payments through April 2021. The 2020 Term Loan requires monthly payments of $ 53,213

of the fair value of long-term debt is based upon inquiries of the financial institutions holding the respective loans and is considered
a Level 2 fair value measurement.
The
respective carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of
the short maturity of these instruments.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s
discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (“MD&A”) is a supplement to the accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements and provides additional information on the Company’s businesses, current developments,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”)
and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.
Forward-Looking
Statements
Except
for the historical information contained herein, this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements concerning: our business strategy; liquidity and
capital expenditures; future sources of revenues and anticipated costs and expenses; and trends in industry activity generally. Such
forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words such as “may,” “will,”
“should,” “expect,” “plan,” “could,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “goal,” or “continue”
or similar language
or by discussions of our outlook, plans, goals, strategy or intentions .
Our
actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions
and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, the risks outlined under “ Risk
Factors ” in this Quarterly Report, that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to
be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. For example, assumptions that could cause actual results to vary materially from future results include, but are not limited
to: competition from other parks, weather conditions during our primary tourist season, the price of animal feed and the price of gasoline.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot
guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Additional risks have been added to our business by the near-term
and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of our Parks, including customers perceptions of engaging in the activities
involved in visiting our Parks, our ability to hire and retain employees in light of the issues posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our
ability to maintain sufficient cash to fund operations due to the possible negative impact on our Park revenues associated with potential
future disruptions in demand as a result of the pandemic.
The
forward-looking statements we make in this Quarterly Report are based on management’s current views and assumptions regarding future
events and speak only as of the date of this report.
We assume no obligation to update any of these
forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting these forward-looking
statements, except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Overview
Through
our wholly owned subsidiaries, we own and operate three regional theme parks and are in the business of acquiring, developing and operating
local and regional theme parks and attractions in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc., a Georgia
corporation (“Wild Animal – Georgia”), Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation (“Wild Animal – Missouri”),
and Aggieland-Parks, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Aggieland Wild Animal – Texas”). Wild Animal – Georgia owns
and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the “Georgia Park”). Wild Animal – Missouri
owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park located in Strafford, Missouri (the “Missouri Park”). Aggieland Wild
Animal – Texas owns and operates the Aggieland Wild Animal Safari theme park near Bryan/College Station, Texas (the “Texas
Park”).
Our
parks are open year round, but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March through early
September. Combined third and fourth quarter net sales were 62.1% and 60.3% of annual attendance based net sales for our 2022 and 2021
fiscal years, respectively. Since the acquisition of our Texas Park, the combined third and fourth quarter concentration of our sales
has been reduced.
17
In
response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities throughout the United States implemented a variety of containment
measures with the objective of slowing the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns.
In early April 2020, our Georgia and Missouri Parks closed to the public due to shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, our Texas Park,
was closed to the public for the month prior to its acquisition, due to a shelter-in-place mandate. We implemented several measures to
mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on our business and financial position. During the initial shutdown period, we reduced staffing,
applied for and received Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans and reduced discretionary spending. In addition, we delayed
closing the Texas Park acquisition to renegotiate various terms, primarily focused on reducing the cash requirements of the acquisition
in the subsequent year.
In
compliance with respective state issued guidelines, each of our parks reopened in early May 2020. After reopening, attendance levels
increased significantly at each of our parks for the balance of our 2020 fiscal year, which continued throughout our 2021 fiscal year
in comparison to comparable pre-COVID-19 periods. We experienced a decline in comparable year-over-year attendance based net sales and
attendance for the last 22 weeks of our 2021 fiscal year and for our entire 2022 fiscal year, respectively. While we experienced a comparable
52-week attendance-based sales decline for our 2022 fiscal year compared to the elevated pandemic levels, our overall sales remain at
significantly higher levels when compared to pre-COVID-19 periods. On a combined basis, attendance-based sales of our Georgia and Missouri
Parks for our 2022 fiscal year were up approximately 43.0% compared to the comparable pre-COVID-19 2019 fiscal year, which we believe
illustrates a significant increase in local and regional awareness of each park, a critical development with positive long-term ramifications
for our business. (Note, our Texas Park, acquired on April 27, 2020, originally opened in May 2019; therefore, a full year of sales is
not available for pre-COVID-19 periods).
Although
we have experienced attendance gains and strong cash flows subsequent to the reopening of our parks after the initial closures at the
beginning of the pandemic, there may be longer-term negative impacts to the Company’s business, results of operations and cash
flows, and financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative impacts may include changes in customer behavior
and preferences, increases in operating expenses to meet consumer expectations and perceptions, limitations in our ability to recruit
and maintain staffing, as well as increasing wages required to retain and recruit staff. There is also the potential for attendance levels
at our parks to moderate or decline as alternative entertainment venues are now open and consumers have broader travel and entertainment
options.
We
are committed to leveraging the strong operating model we have established at our Georgia Park at all three of our properties, with a
focus on increasing attendance through enhanced marketing efforts and focused capital investments, as well as continuing to prudently
increase the average revenue generated per guest visit via concession and gift shop revenues. Among our highest priorities over the next
several years is continuing the integration of our Texas Park, continual enhancement of the overall guest experience at each of our parks,
as well as the introduction of new programming and enhanced marketing efforts. As our Texas Park first opened to the public in May 2019,
we believe there remains tremendous potential to increase attendance by increasing the local and regional awareness of this facility
via advertising and promotion. We are pleased with the expanded attendance at our Missouri Park since it reopened in May 2020 and plan
on leveraging the increased exposure of this facility to continue to build on this recent success.
Our
2023 fiscal year capital investment plan remains elevated versus historical levels, however, is lower than the $1.84 million record level
of capital spending during our 2022 fiscal year. Our 2023 fiscal year capital plan targets substantial guest-facing enhancements along
with necessary continued investments in infrastructure, maintenance and plant integrity at all three of our parks, delivering a marketable
attraction at each property. Notable investments include the upgrade of a central node in the Georgia walkabout including multiple animal
enclosures, a new otter exhibit in Missouri, as well as an additional pasture in Texas, which will enable visitors to feed zebras, and
eventually giraffes, directly from their vehicles. Our 2023 fiscal year capital plan also includes investment in fleet vehicles, roadways
and accessing public water in Texas in order to open full-service food and beverage operations. We believe our 2023 fiscal year capital
plan sets the stage for longer-term master planning and optimization at every park. Our plan to open a significant new giraffe exhibit
at our Georgia Park during our 2022 fiscal year experienced delays due to a highly inflationary period for building materials and a challenging
labor market. We remain committed to this showcase attraction and expect to establish a timeline for this project during our 2023 fiscal
year. Our 2023 fiscal year projected capital investment spending will again be fully funded from our existing cash and continues to demonstrate
our commitment to building for long-term, sustainable growth.
Our
long-term business plan also includes expansion via the acquisition of additional local or regional theme parks and attractions. We believe
acquisitions, if any, should not unnecessarily encumber the Company with additional debt that cannot be justified by current operations.
We may also pursue contract management opportunities for themed attractions owned by third parties. By using a combination of equity,
debt and other financing options, we intend to carefully monitor stockholder value in conjunction with the pursuit of growth.
18
Strong
annual operating cash flow over the past several fiscal years has provided us with incremental operating margin, funded significant increases
in capital investment, and provided us with the financial strength to complete the Aggieland Safari acquisition. However, our current
size and operating model leaves us little room for error. Any future capital raised by us is likely to result in dilution to existing
stockholders. It is possible that cash generated by, or available to, us may not be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs
for the near-term.
Results
of Operations for the Three Month Period Ended January 1, 2023 as Compared to Three Month Period Ended January 2, 2022
We
manage our operations on an individual location basis. Discrete financial information is maintained for each park and provided to our
corporate management for review and as a basis for decision-making. The primary performance measures used to allocate resources are Park
earnings before interest and tax expense, and free cash flow. We use this measure of operating profit to gauge segment performance because
we believe this measure is the most indicative of performance trends and the overall earnings potential of each segment.

Net Sales
Our
total net sales for the three month period ended January 1, 2023 were $1.86 million, a decrease of $83,379, compared to the three month
period ended January 2, 2022. Our Parks’ combined attendance based net sales decreased by $124,472 or 6.4%, while animal sales
increased by $41,093.
Our
Georgia Park’s attendance based net sales decreased by $13,099 or 1.0%, to $1.30 million, while animal sales increased by $43,800.
Our Missouri Park’s attendance based net sales decreased by $47,630 or 17.8%, to $219,765, while animal sales decreased by $2,707.
Our Texas Park’s attendance based net sales increased by $63,743 or 17.4%, to $302,473.
For
the three month period ended January 1, 2023, paid attendance at our Georgia, Missouri and Texas Parks decreased by approximately 10.2%,
23.5% and 23.3%, respectively. We believe our attendance levels for the three month period ended January 1, 2023 were unfavorably impacted
by weather conditions during several weekends and key holiday periods.
Segment
Operating Margin
Our
segment income from operations was $69,265 for the three month period ended January 1, 2023, a net increase of $206,809, compared to
a segment loss from operations of $137,544 for the three month period ended January 2, 2022. Our Georgia Park generated segment operating
income of $388,098, a decrease of $10,672, primarily attributable to lower attendance based net sales, as well as higher general operating
expenses, partially offset by higher animal sales and lower advertising expense. Our Missouri Park generated a segment operating loss
of $162,569, a decrease of $243,340, primarily attributable to special events spending in the prior year, as well as lower advertising
and compensation expenses, partially offset by lower attendance based net sales and a gain on asset sales in the prior year. Our Texas
Park generated a segment operating loss of $156,264, an increase of $25,859, primarily attributable to lower attendance based net sales
partially offset by lower advertising expense.
19
Corporate
Expenses
Corporate
spending decreased by $128,904 to $223,702 during the three month period ended January 1, 2023, primarily due to the elimination of executive
bonuses and the timing of director compensation.
Other
Income, Net
Other
income, net increased by $2,707, to $29,613, attributable to higher interest income, partially offset by lower mineral rights royalty
income for our Texas Park.
Interest
Expense
Interest
expense for the three month period ended January 1, 2023 decreased by $10,160, to $58,736, primarily attributable to a reduction in term
loan interest, as well as imputed interest on a right of use asset in the prior year.
Income
Taxes
For
the three month period ended January 1, 2023, we reported a pre-tax loss of $183,560. For the fiscal year ending October 1, 2023 we expect
to generate pre-tax income and to record a tax provision at a blended effective federal and state income tax rate of approximately 27.0%.
Based on a year-to-date blend of federal and State of Georgia pre-tax income, we recorded an income tax benefit of $30,600 for the three
month period ended January 1, 2023.
Net
Income and Income Per Share
For
the three month period ended January 1, 2023, we reported a net loss of $152,960 or $0.00 per basic share and per fully diluted share,
compared to a net loss of $421,940 or $0.01 per basic share and per fully diluted share, for the three month period ended January 2,
2022, resulting in a decrease of $268,980. This decrease in our net loss is attributable to a $243,340 decrease in the segment loss for
our Missouri Park, a $128,904 decrease in Corporate spending, a $10,160 decrease in interest expense, and a $2,707 increase in other
income, partially offset by a $25,859 increase in the segment loss for our Texas Park, a $10,672 decrease in segment income for our Georgia
Park, and a $79,600 decrease in our seasonal income tax benefit.
Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Financial
Condition and Liquidity
Our
primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. Historically, our slow season
starts after Labor Day in September and runs until Spring Break, which typically begins toward the middle to end of March. The first
and second quarters of our fiscal year have historically generated negative cash flow, requiring us to use cash generated from prior
fiscal years, as well as borrowing on a seasonal basis, to fund operations and prepare our Parks for the busy season during the third
and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. As a result of our improved cash position, during our 2022 fiscal year we did not utilize any
seasonal borrowing, nor do we anticipate using any seasonal borrowing during our 2023 fiscal year.
Our
working capital was $4.36 million as of January 1, 2023, compared to $4.67 million as of October 2, 2022. The decrease in working capital
primarily reflects cash used for capital investments and scheduled term loan payments during the three month period ended January 1,
2023.
Total
loan debt, including current maturities, as of January 1, 2023 was $4.78 million compared to $4.96 million as of October 2, 2022. The
decrease in total loan debt is the result of scheduled term loan payments during the three month period ended January 1, 2023.
As
of January 1, 2023, we had equity of $15.20 million and total loan debt of $4.78 million, resulting in a debt to equity ratio of 0.31
to 1.0, compared to 0.32 to 1.0 as of October 2, 2022.
Operating
Activities
Net
cash used in operating activities was $381,220 for the three month period ended January 1, 2023, compared to $172,173 for the three month
period ended January 2, 2022, resulting in an increase of $209,047, primarily due to paying down current liabilities, partially offset
by reduction in our net loss.
20
Investing
Activities
Net
cash used in investing activities was $187,207 for the three month period ended January 1, 2023, compared to $272,667 for the three
month period ended January 2, 2022. Our capital spending for the three month period ended January 1, 2023 was $181,741, compared to $272,667
for the three month period ended January 2, 2022.
Financing
Activities
Net
cash used in financing activities was $181,621 for the three month period ended January 1, 2023, compared to $334,327 for the three month
period ended January 2, 2022, resulting in a decrease of $152,706. During the three months ended January 2, 2022 we made $160,863 of
payments on a financing lease obligation.
Subsequent
Events
On
February 2, 2023, we declared the annual compensation award to seven directors for their service on our Board of Directors.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Parks!
America, Inc. (the “Registrant”) maintains “controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”) in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated thereunder, that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Registrant’s Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Registrant’s management recognized that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, the Registrant’s management was necessarily required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
With
the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Registrant, the Registrant’s management
has evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon the evaluation, the Registrant’s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at a reasonable assurance level.
In
addition, there were no changes in the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Registrant’s fiscal quarter ended January 1, 2023 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On
December 16, 2022, we received notice that on August 10, 2022 a former employee of Aggieland Wild Animal – Texas, filed a Complaint
in the 361 st
District Court of Brazos County, Texas (case no. 22-001839-CV-361), alleging the Company and Aggieland-Parks,
Inc. committed several instances of employment discrimination. The Complaint seeks unspecified economic, compensatory and punitive damages,
as well as attorney’s fees and costs. We are vigorously defending this claim.
On
February 17, 2021, two children of James Meikle, our former President and Chief Operating Officer, filed a Complaint in the Eighth
Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada (case no. A-21-829563-C), alleging we were obligated under Mr. Meikle’s
Employment Agreement to purchase at least $540,000 of life insurance for Mr. Meikle, who passed away on November 28, 2018. The
Complaint was seeking damages of $540,000, as well as interest and expenses. The trial date was set for February 14, 2023. Effective
August 5, 2022, we agreed to pay the plaintiffs $100,000 to settle this Complaint and obtain a full release for any related
complaints. The release was completed on August 26, 2022, we issued payment for the settlement amount on August 31, 2022 and an
order of dismissal was filed on September 19, 2022.
Except
as noted above, we are not a party to any pending legal proceeding, nor are any of our properties the subject of a pending legal proceeding,
that is not in the ordinary course of business or otherwise material to the financial condition of its business. None of our directors,
officers or affiliates is involved in a proceeding adverse to our business or has a material interest adverse to our business.
ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS
You
should read the MD&A together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes, each included elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report, in conjunction with the Parks! America, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.
Some of the information contained in the MD&A or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect
to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review
the “ Risk Factors ” below for a discussion of important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this
report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
Risk
Factors Relating to Our Business:
The
COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health risks and measures taken in response thereto may have a material negative impact on our business,
results of operations and cash flows, and financial condition. The extent of the impact is dependent upon future developments, which
are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
In
March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel strain of a coronavirus, as a pandemic.
The rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in governmental authorities throughout the United States implementing a variety of containment
measures with the objective of slowing the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns.
The COVID-19 pandemic and these containment measures have the potential to have a material impact on the Company’s business.
We
implemented several measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on our business and financial position. During the initial shutdown
period, we reduced staffing, applied for and received Paycheck Protection Program loans and reduced discretionary spending. In addition,
we delayed closing the Texas Park acquisition to renegotiate various terms, primarily focused on reducing the cash requirements of the
acquisition in the subsequent year.
In
early April 2020, our Georgia and Missouri Parks closed to the public due to shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, our Texas Park was
closed to the public for the month prior to its acquisition, due to a shelter-in-place mandate. In compliance with respective state issued
guidelines, each of our parks reopened in early May 2020. After reopening, attendance levels increased significantly at each of our parks
for the balance of its 2020 fiscal year, which continued throughout our 2021 fiscal year in comparison to comparable pre-COVID-19 periods.
While attendance based net sales remain higher compared to pre-COVID-19 periods, we experienced a decline in comparable year-over-year
attendance based net sales and attendance for the last 22 weeks of our 2021 fiscal year and for our entire 2022 fiscal year, respectively.
22
As
the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates, our future operations are dependent on factors outside of our knowledge or control, including the
duration and severity of this pandemic or similar public health risks. While we have experienced attendance gains and strong cash flow
in comparison to periods preceding the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be longer-term negative impacts to our business,
results of operations and cash flows, and financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative impacts may include
changes in customer behavior and preferences, increases in operating expenses to meet consumer expectations and perceptions, limitations
in our ability to recruit and maintain staffing, as well as increasing wages required retain and recruit staff. There is also the potential
for attendance levels at our parks to moderate or decline as alternative entertainment venues are now open and consumers have broader
travel and entertainment options.
The
extent and duration of longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health risks on customer perceptions of our parks
are largely uncertain and dependent upon future developments that cannot be accurately predicted. There is no recent historical precedent
that provides insights into the longer-term impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on consumer behavior. As a result, the ultimate
impact is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent COVID-19 will have on our overall business, results
of operations and cash flows, and financial position. COVID-19 and the resulting economic disruptions have also led to significant volatility
in the capital markets. As a smaller public company, our ability to access cash is already difficult and the impacts of COVID-19 on capital
markets has likely negatively impacted our ability to raise additional capital at a reasonable cost.
General
economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our
business and operating results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence
and spending levels, tax rates, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic)
and natural disasters, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), and credit market conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely
impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors. A general economic slowdown or recession resulting in a decrease in
discretionary spending could adversely affect the frequency with which guests choose to visit our parks and the amount that our guests
spend when they visit. Our ability to source supplies, materials and services at reasonable costs and in a timely manner could be impacted
by adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. For example, our ability to obtain gift shop merchandise had been adversely impacted
by recent supply chain distributions at least in part attributed to collateral impacts from COVID-19. Similarly, our plans to open a
new giraffe exhibit at out Georgia Park experienced delays during our 2022 fiscal year, in large part due to building material price
increases and labor shortages in the construction industry.
Conditions
beyond our control, including natural disasters or extreme weather, could damage our properties and could adversely impact attendance
at our parks and result in decreased revenues.
Natural
disasters, public heath crises, epidemics, pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, terrorist activities, power outages or other
events outside our control could disrupt our operations, impair critical systems, damage our properties or reduce attendance at our parks
or require temporary park closures. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would
have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair or the expense of the interruption to our business. Furthermore, natural disasters
such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes or extreme weather events linked to climate change, may interrupt or impede access to our affected
properties or require evacuations and may cause attendance at our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. For example,
our Texas Park was closed for several weeks, experienced power outages and sustained property damage associated with winter storms in
February 2021. The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
We
cannot predict the frequency, duration or severity of these activities and the effect that they may have on our business, financial condition
or results of operations.
23
The
Theme Park Industry is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively.
The
theme park industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented, rapidly evolving, and subject to technological change and intense marketing
by providers with similar products. One of our competitors for attracting general recreation dollars, Callaway Gardens, is located within
five miles of our Georgia Park. In May 2018, Great Wolf Resorts opened an expansive lodge and indoor waterpark within 10 miles of our
Georgia Park. In September 2017, the founder of Bass Pro Shops opened “Johnny Morris’ Wonders of Wildlife National Museum
and Aquarium”, approximately 12 miles from our Missouri Park in Springfield, Missouri. Branson, Missouri is located just 45 minutes
from our Missouri Park. There are a variety of animal attractions throughout southeastern Texas; the nearest is Franklin Drive Thru Safari,
within a 35-40 minute drive of our Texas Park. Many of our current competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater
market presence as well as greater financial, technical, operational, marketing and other resources and experience than we have. In the
event that a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets we may not be able to compete successfully
in such markets. We believe that competition will continue to increase, potentially placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure
could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce costs commensurate with such price reductions. In addition, the
pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies
to provide the same or similar products offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost
effective products, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
We
face strong competition from numerous entertainment alternatives.
In
addition to competing with other themed and amusement parks, our venues compete with other types of recreational venues and entertainment
alternatives, including but not limited to movies, sports attractions, vacation travel and video games. There can be no assurance that
we will successfully differentiate ourselves from these entertainment alternatives or that consumers will consider our entertainment
offerings to be more appealing than those of our competitors. The increasing availability and quality of technology-based entertainment
has provided families with a wider selection of entertainment alternatives in their homes, including home entertainment units, in-home
and online gaming, as well as on-demand streaming video and related access to various forms of entertainment. In addition, traditional
theme parks have been able to reduce the cost and increase the variety of their attractions by implementing technologies that cannot
be readily incorporated by wild animal attractions such as our Parks.
The
suspension or termination of any of our business licenses may have a negative impact on our business.
We
maintain a variety of business licenses issued by federal, state and local government agencies that are required to be renewed periodically.
We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in renewing all our licenses on a periodic basis. The suspension, termination or expiration
of one or more of these licenses could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profits. In addition, any changes to the
requirements for any of our licenses could affect our ability to maintain the licenses.
Our
insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.
Companies
engaged in the theme park business may be sued for substantial damages in the event of an actual or alleged accident. An accident occurring
at our Parks or at competing parks may reduce attendance, increase insurance premiums, and negatively impact our operating results. Our
properties contain drive-through, safari style animal parks, and there are inherent risks associated with allowing the public to interact
with animals. Although we carry liability insurance to cover this risk, there can be no assurance that our coverage will be adequate
to cover liabilities, or that we will be able to afford or obtain adequate coverage should a catastrophic incident occur.
We
currently have $6.0 million of liability insurance per occurrence, which is capped at $10.0 million in aggregate. We will continue to
use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain policies of liability, fire and casualty insurance sufficient to provide reasonable coverage
for risks arising from accidents, fire, weather, other acts of God, and other potential casualties. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to obtain adequate levels of insurance to protect against suits and judgments in connection with accidents or other disasters
that may occur in our Parks.
24
We
may not identify or complete acquisitions in a timely, cost-effective manner, if at all.
Our
business plan includes expansion via the acquisition of additional local or regional theme parks and attractions. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in acquiring and operating additional local or regional theme parks and attractions. Competition for acquisition
opportunities in the theme park industry is intense as there are a limited number of parks within the United States that could reasonably
qualify as acquisition targets for us. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to: identify acquisition
opportunities; obtain debt and equity financing; and obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy
may be hindered if we are not able to successfully identify acquisition targets or obtain the necessary financing or regulatory approvals,
including but not limited to those arising under federal and state antitrust and environmental laws.
Significant
amounts of additional financing may be necessary for the implementation of our Business Plan.
The
Company may require additional debt and equity financing to pursue its business plan. There can be no assurance that we will be successful
in obtaining additional financing. Lack of additional funding could force us to substantially curtail our expansion plans. Furthermore,
the issuance by the Company of any additional securities would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders and may affect the price
of our common stock.
Our
ownership of real property subjects us to environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures
and liabilities.
We
may be required to incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges to air, water and land;
the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Under these and
other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at
one of our properties. As an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third party for property
damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination. Environmental laws
typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence
of the contaminants. The liability under environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible
and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances
may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to
use our property. We are not currently aware of any material environmental risks regarding our properties. However, we may be required
to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards or to mitigate environmental risks in the future.
We
are dependent upon the services of our Executive Officers, key personnel and consultants.
Our
success is heavily dependent on the continued active participation of our executive officers. Loss of the services of one or more of
these officers could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Further,
our success and achievement of our growth plans depend on our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical
and managerial personnel. Competition for qualified employees among companies in the theme park industry is intense, and the loss of
any such persons, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate any additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion
of the Company’s activities, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. The inability of the Company to attract and
retain the necessary personnel, and consultants and advisors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial
condition or results of operations.
Increased
labor and employee benefit costs may negatively impact our results of operations. We also depend on a seasonal workforce, many of whom
are paid at or near minimum wage.
Labor
is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors,
including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs, as well
as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits. Furthermore, our operations
are dependent in part on a seasonal workforce, many of whom are paid at or near minimum wage. We seek to manage seasonal wages and the
timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place for peak and low seasons; however, we may be unable to recruit
and hire sufficient personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, we cannot guarantee that material increases in the cost of securing
our workforce will not occur in the future. Increased state or federal minimum wage requirements, general wages or an inadequate workforce
could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We anticipate that the recent upward pressures on general wage rates may increase
our salary, wage and benefit expenses in our 2023 fiscal year and beyond, and further legislative changes or competitive wage rates could
continue to increase these expenses in the future.
25
Data
privacy regulation and our ability to comply could harm our business.
We
(or third parties on our behalf) collect, store and use personal information and other customer data we receive through online ticket
sales, marketing, mailing lists, and guest reservations. There are multiple federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and protection
of personal information and data, and these laws and regulations continue to evolve. For example, many states have passed laws requiring
notification to customers when there is a security breach involving their personal data and multiple jurisdictions are considering legislation
that may impose liability if a business fails to properly safeguard personal information of its customers. Maintaining compliance with
applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs. While we believe our cybersecurity measures are adequate,
if we were to experience a data breach, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or costly litigation.
Risk
Factors Relating to Our Common Stock:
Our
Common Stock is subject to the “penny stock” rules of the SEC and the trading market in our Common Stock is limited, which
makes transactions in our Common Stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our Common Stock.
Our
common stock is considered a “penny stock” and the sale of our stock by you will be subject to the “penny stock rules”
of the SEC. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers to take steps before making any penny stock trades in customer accounts. As
a result, the market for our shares could be illiquid and there could be delays in the trading of our stock, which would negatively affect
your ability to sell your shares and could negatively affect the trading price of your shares.
We
do not expect to pay dividends for some time, if at all.
As
of the date of this report, no cash dividends have been paid on our common stock. We expect that any income from operations will be devoted
to our future operations and growth, as well as to service our debt. We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the near future. Any future
determination as to the payment of dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend
on our earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
The provisions of credit agreements, which we may enter into from time to time, may also restrict the declaration of dividends on our
common stock.
