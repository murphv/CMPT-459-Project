NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation Organization and Ownership Structure —
Atkore Inc. (the
“ Company ” ,
“ Atkore ”
or
“ AI ” ) is a leading manufacturer of Electrical products primarily for the non-residential construction and renovation markets and Safety & Infrastructure solutions for the construction and industrial markets.
Atkore was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 4, 2010 under the name Atkore International Group, Inc.
As of December 30, 2022, Atkore was the sole stockholder of Atkore International Holdings Inc. ( “ AIH ” ), which in turn was the sole stockholder of Atkore International Inc. ("AII"). On December 31, 2022, AIH merged into AII, with AII being the surviving entity. Accordingly, Atkore is now the sole stockholder of AII. The Electrical segment manufactures high quality products used in the construction of electrical power systems including conduit, cable, and installation accessories.
This segment serves contractors, in partnership with the electrical wholesale channel. The Safety & Infrastructure segment designs and manufactures solutions including metal framing, mechanical pipe, perimeter security, and cable management for the protection and reliability of critical infrastructure.
These solutions are marketed to contractors, original equipment manufacturers and end users.
Basis of Presentation —
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( “ GAAP ” ). These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Company ’ s accounting policies and on the same basis as those financial statements included in the Company ’ s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“ SEC ” ) on November 18, 2022, and should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Certain information and disclosures normally included in the Company ’ s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.      The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities used in operating the Company ’ s business. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.      These statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that the Company considered necessary to present a fair statement of its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The results reported in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. Fiscal Periods —
The Company has a fiscal year that ends on September 30. The Company ’ s fiscal quarters typically end on the last Friday in December, March and June as it follows a 4-5-4 calendar.      Use of Estimates —
The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and report the associated amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 7 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Atkore has not adopted any accounting standards in the current fiscal year. There are no accounting standards with adoption dates in the next fiscal year that are applicable to the Company. 2. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
The Company’s revenue arrangements primarily consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods which is satisfied at a point in time when title, risks and rewards of ownership, and subsequently control have transferred to the customer.
This generally occurs when the product is shipped to the customer, with an immaterial amount of transactions in which control transfers upon delivery.
The Company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations.
The Company has certain arrangements that require it to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of products to be returned.
The Company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements, and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of sale and to reduce the transaction price.
These arrangements include sales discounts and allowances, volume rebates, and returned goods. The Company records its obligations related to these items within the Customer Liabilities line on the balance sheet.      The Company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of goods sold.
Sales taxes and other usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.
The Company does not evaluate whether the selling price includes a financing interest component for contracts that are less than a year.
The Company also expenses costs incurred to obtain a contract, primarily sales commissions, as all obligations will be settled in less than
one year . The Company typically receives payment
30
to
60
days from the point it has satisfied the related performance obligation.
See Note 16, “Segment Information” for revenue disaggregated by geography and product categories. 3. ACQUISITIONS
From time to time, the Company enters into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to obtain new customers.
Fiscal 2023 On November 7, 2022, Atkore International Inc., acquired the assets of Elite Polymer Solutions (“Elite”), for a purchase price of $ 89,981 . Elite is a manufacturer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) conduit, primarily serving the telecommunications, utility, and transportation markets. As a result of the acquisition, the Company preliminarily recognized $ 30,806
of goodwill, $ 55,260
of identifiable intangible assets, of which $ 55,000
relates to customer relationships with an estimated useful life of
7
years, and $ 3,915
of working capital and other net tangible assets. As of December 30, 2022, the purchase price allocation has not been finalized as the Company is finalizing working capital, inventory, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities and fixed asset fair values. The acquisition in fiscal 2023 was funded using cash-on-hand. The Company incurred approximately $ 839
in acquisition-related expenses for this acquisition, which was recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Net sales and net income of the above acquisition are included in the condensed consolidated financial statement of operations for the post-acquisition period. Due to the immaterial nature of this acquisition,
8 the Company did not include the pro forma results of operations for this acquisition for the current period or the previous interim period.
Fiscal 2022 On August 31, 2022, Atkore International Inc., and Atkore HDPE, LLC, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, acquired the outstanding stock of
two
separate, but related, companies doing business as Cascade Poly Pipe & Conduit (“Cascade”) and Northwest Polymers, for a total purchase price of $ 62,100 , of which $ 52,738
was paid at closing and an additional purchase price payable of $ 9,362
was accrued. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company paid $ 3,111
of the accrued purchase price.
Cascade is a manufacturer specializing in smooth wall HDPE conduit made from recycled materials, primarily serving the telecommunications, utility and datacom markets.
Northwest Polymers is a leading recycler of PVC, HDPE and other plastics and a strategic supply partner to Cascade and other manufacturers. The purchase price allocation has not been finalized as the Company is finalizing working capital, inventory, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities and fixed asset fair values. On June 22, 2022, Atkore International Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of United Poly Systems, LLC (“United Poly”), for a purchase price of $ 227,234 . United Poly is a
manufacturer of high density polyethylene (“HDPE”) pressure pipe and conduit, primarily serving the telecommunications, water infrastructure, renewables and energy markets. The purchase price allocation has not been finalized as the Company is finalizing working capital, inventory, intangible asset, deferred tax asset and liabilities and fixed asset fair values. On May 19, 2022, Allied Tube and Conduit Corporation, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired the assets of Talon Products, LLC (“Talon”), for a purchase price of $ 4,193 .
Included in Talon’s purchase price is a purchase price payable of $ 402 . Talon is a manufacturer of non-metallic, injection molded cable cleats, primarily serving the power distribution markets.
The Company finalized the purchase price allocation of Talon in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. On December 21, 2021, Atkore HDPE, LLC and Allied Tube and Conduit Corporation, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, acquired the assets of Four Star Industries LLC (“Four Star”), for a purchase price of $ 23,195 . Four Star is a manufacturer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) conduit, primarily serving the telecommunications, utility, infrastructure and datacom markets. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation of Four Star in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. On December 20, 2021, Columbia-MBF Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sasco Tubes & Roll Forming Inc. (“Sasco”), for a purchase price of $ 16,184 , of which $ 13,320
was paid at closing and additional purchase price payable of $ 2,864
was accrued. Sasco is a Canadian manufacturer of metal framing and related products serving the electrical, mechanical, construction and solar industries. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation of Sasco in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The acquisitions in fiscal 2022 were funded using cash-on-hand.
The Company incurred approximately $ 3,424
in acquisition-related expenses for these acquisitions, which were recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. 9 The purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values.
The following table summarizes the Level 3 fair values assigned to the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date for fiscal 2022: (in thousands) United Poly Other Total Fair value of consideration transferred:   Cash consideration $ 227,234   $ 93,044   $ 320,278   Purchase price payable —   12,628   12,628   Total consideration transferred $ 227,234   $ 105,672   $ 332,906   Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:   Cash 11,639   126   11,765   Accounts receivable 23,679   9,291   32,970   Inventories 13,455   8,111   21,566   Intangible assets 128,840   54,330   183,170   Fixed assets 13,648   8,533   22,181   Accounts payable ( 11,940 ) ( 5,086 ) ( 17,026 ) Income taxes ( 15,542 ) ( 2,075 ) ( 17,617 ) Other ( 1,742 ) 244   ( 1,498 ) Net assets acquired 162,037   73,474   235,511   Excess purchase price attributed to goodwill acquired $ 65,197   $ 32,198   $ 97,395   The Company estimates $ 31.1  million of the goodwill recognized by the fiscal 2022 acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes, $ 11.7  million that relates to United Poly and $ 19.4  million that relates to Cascade and Northwest Polymer. The Company estimates Goodwill recognized from the acquisitions in fiscal 2022 consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale from integrating this company with existing businesses.
The following table summarizes the fair value of intangible assets as of the acquisition date:   United Poly Other (in thousands) Fair Value Weighted Average Useful Life (Years) Fair Value Weighted Average Useful Life (Years) Customer relationships $ 111,700   11 $ 50,020   9 Other 17,140   8 4,310   8 Total intangible assets $ 128,840   $ 54,330   Net sales and net income of the acquired companies are included in the consolidated statement of operations for the post-acquisition period. Due to the immaterial nature of the acquisitions acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company did not include the pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions for the current period or the previous interim period. 10 4. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company provides pension benefits through a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering eligible U.S. employees. As of September 30, 2017, all defined pension benefit plans were frozen, whereby participants no longer accrue credited service.
The net periodic benefit credit was as follows:  Three months ended (in thousands) Note December 30, 2022 December 24, 2021 Interest cost $ 1,294   $ 739   Expected return on plan assets ( 1,257 ) ( 1,348 ) Amortization of actuarial loss 167   158   Net periodic benefit cost (credit) 5 $ 204   $ ( 451 ) 5. OTHER (INCOME) AND EXPENSE, NET

( 14 ) ( 176 ) Foreign exchange loss (gain) on intercompany loans ( 149 ) 319   Pension-related benefits 204   ( 451 ) Other (income) and expense, net
$ 41   $ ( 308 ) 6. INCOME TAXES     On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law. The IRA contains significant tax law changes, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income, which if applicable for the Company would be effective beginning October 1, 2023, a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases after December 31, 2022, and various tax incentives which include, but are not limited to, credits related to the manufacturing of solar powered energy which will take effect January 1, 2023.
The Company is currently evaluating this legislation and determining what impact it would have to the Company’s financial statements.
For the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 24, 2021, the Company’s effective tax rate attributable to income before income taxes was
21.9 % and
21.8 %, respectively. For the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 24, 2021, the Company’s income tax expense was $ 48,559
and $ 56,975
respectively. The increase in the current period effective tax rate was driven by a decrease in the excess tax benefit associated with stock compensation offset by a decrease in state tax expense.
A valuation allowance has been recorded against certain net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is determined to be more likely than not that these assets will not be fully realized in the foreseeable future. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon whether the Company can generate future taxable income in the appropriate character and jurisdiction to utilize the assets. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods.
11 The Company recognizes the benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns in the provision for income taxes only for those positions that we have determined are more likely than not to be realized upon examination.
We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. During the three months ended December 30, 2022, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 1,671
primarily due to uncertain tax positions in various state jurisdictions. For the three months ended December 30, 2022, the Company made no additional provision for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as the investments are essentially permanent in duration. 7. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company calculates basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method.
Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities as if all of the net earnings for the period had been distributed.
The Company ’ s participating securities consist of share-based payment awards that contain a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends and therefore are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common stockholders.
Basic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing the net earnings allocated to common stock by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding for the period.
Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net earnings allocated to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period, as adjusted for the potential dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: Three months ended (in thousands, except per share data) December 30, 2022 December 24, 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 173,492   $ 204,843   Less: Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities 2,807   3,642   Net income available to common shareholders $ 170,685   $ 201,201   Denominator: Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 40,085   45,980   Effect of dilutive securities: Non-participating employee stock options

AII ’ s availability under the ABL Credit Facility was $ 312,905
as of December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022. 13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company periodically uses forward currency contracts to hedge the effects of foreign exchange relating to intercompany balances denominated in a foreign currency. These derivative instruments are not formally designated as a hedge by the Company.
Short-term forward currency contracts are recorded in either other current assets or other current liabilities and long-term forward currency contracts are recorded in either other long-term assets or other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The fair value gains and losses are included in other (income) and expense, net within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Note 5, “Other (Income) and Expense, net” for further detail.
Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments are recognized in the operating section of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The Company had no active forward currency contracts or other derivative instruments as of December 30, 2022 or September 30, 2022, with the last such contract having expired in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
The following table presents the Company ’ s assets and liabilities measured at fair value: December 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 1 Level 2 Assets Cash equivalents $ 234,940   $ —   $ 291,757   $ —   The Company ’ s remaining financial instruments consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable whose carrying value approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature.
The estimated fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets were as follows: December 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 (in thousands) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Senior Secured Term Loan Facility due May 26, 2028 $ 373,000   $ 373,157   $ 373,000   $ 370,203   Senior Notes due June 2031 400,000   348,388   400,000   318,912   Total Debt $ 773,000   $ 721,545   $ 773,000   $ 689,115   In determining the approximate fair value of its long-term debt, the Company used the trading values among financial institutions, and these values fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of the ABL Credit Facility approximates fair value due to it being a market-linked variable rate debt.
16 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company has obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods. As of December 30, 2022, such obligations were $ 262,500
for the rest of fiscal year 2023 and $ 9,067
for fiscal year 2024 and beyond. These amounts represent open purchase orders for materials used in production. Insurable Liabilities
— The Company maintains policies with various insurance companies for its workers’ compensation, product, property, general, auto, and executive liability risks. The insurance policies that the Company maintains have various retention levels and excess coverage limits. The establishment and update of liabilities for unpaid claims, including claims incurred but not reported, is based on management's estimate as a result of the assessment by the Company's claim administrator of each claim and an independent actuarial valuation of the nature and severity of total claims. The Company utilizes a third-party claims administrator to pay claims, track and evaluate actual claims experience, and ensure consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation. Legal Contingencies
— Historically, a number of lawsuits have been filed against the Company and the Company has also received other claim demand letters alleging that the Company's anti-microbial coated steel sprinkler pipe, which the Company has not manufactured or sold for several years, is incompatible with chlorinated polyvinyl chloride and caused stress cracking in such pipe manufactured by third parties when installed together in the same sprinkler system, which the Company refers to collectively as the “Special Products Claims.” Tyco International Ltd. (“Tyco”), now Johnson Controls, Inc. (“JCI”), has a contractual obligation to indemnify the Company in respect of all remaining and future claims of incompatibility between the Company's antimicrobial coated steel sprinkler pipe and CPVC pipe used in the same sprinkler system.
When Special Products Claims arise, JCI has defended and indemnified the Company as required. As of September 30, 2022, the Company believes that the range of reasonably possible losses for Special Products Claims and other product liabilities is between $ 1,000
and $ 8,000 . At this time, the Company does not expect the outcome of the Special Products Claims proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and the Company believes that its reserves are adequate for all remaining contingencies for Special Products Claims.
In addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time, the Company is subject to a number of disputes, administrative proceedings and other claims arising out of the ordinary conduct of the Company ’ s business. These matters generally relate to disputes arising out of the use or installation of the Company ’ s products, product liability litigation, contract disputes, patent infringement accusations, employment matters, personal injury claims and similar matters. On the basis of information currently available to the Company, it does not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is unpredictable, and the Company could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 15. GUARANTEES
The Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $ 12,095
supporting workers ’
compensation and general liability insurance policies as of December 30, 2022. The Company also had surety bonds primarily related to performance guarantees on supply agreements and construction contracts, and payment of duties and taxes totaling $ 17,548
as of December 30, 2022. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no
17 reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company ’ s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for product performance and contract completion. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company ’ s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 16. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Electrical segment manufactures high quality products used in the construction of electrical power systems including conduit, cable and installation accessories.
This segment serves contractors in partnership with the electrical wholesale channel. The Safety & Infrastructure segment designs and manufactures solutions including metal framing, mechanical pipe, perimeter security and cable management for the protection and reliability of critical infrastructure.
These solutions are marketed to contractors, original equipment manufacturers and end users.
Both segments use Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of profit and loss. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is income (loss) before income taxes, adjusted to exclude unallocated expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, certain legal matters, and other items, such as inventory reserves and adjustments, (gain) loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, insurance recovery related to damages of property, plant and equipment, release of indemnified uncertain tax positions, realized or unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency impacts of intercompany loans and related forward currency derivatives, gain on purchase of business, restructuring costs and transaction costs.
Intersegment transactions primarily consist of product sales at designated transfer prices on an arm ’ s-length basis. Gross profit earned and reported within the segment is eliminated in the Company ’ s consolidated results. Certain manufacturing and distribution expenses are allocated between the segments on a pro rata basis due to the shared nature of activities. Recorded amounts represent a proportional amount of the quantity of product produced for each segment. Certain assets, such as machinery and equipment and facilities, are not allocated to each segment despite serving both segments. These shared assets are reported within the Safety & Infrastructure segment. The Company allocates certain corporate operating expenses that directly benefit our operating segments, such as insurance and information technology, on a basis that reasonably approximates an estimate of the use of these services.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward- looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and included or referenced elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections entitled
“ Forward-Looking Statements ”
and
“ Risk Factors. ” Incremental Market Uncertainties We continue to monitor developments related to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic to assess its impact on our business. Further uncertainty and delays in our end-markets could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products. Some jurisdictions may raise taxes to help cover pandemic-related costs, and disruptions to or adverse conditions in the financial industry could affect our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. Factors that contribute to our ability to adjust to the outbreak include benefiting from mostly localized supply chains and continuing to take actions within our control to minimize the disruptive impacts of the outbreak.
However, there can be no assurance that we will not be materially and adversely impacted in the future.
In addition to the uncertainties brought about by COVID-19, recent events, including central bank interest rate increases, inflation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, are creating additional uncertainty in the global economy, generally, and in the markets we operate in. COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other factors have had and will continue to have adverse effects on global supply chains, which may impact some aspects of our business. Furthermore, we are mindful of the effects that adverse weather can have on our domestic supply chain. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The consolidated results of operations for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 24, 2021 were as follows: Three months ended (in thousands) December 30, 2022 December 24, 2021 Change % Change Net sales $ 833,821  $ 840,801  $ (6,980) (0.8) % Cost of sales 499,468  485,993  13,475  2.8  % Gross profit 334,353  354,808  (20,455) (5.8) % Selling, general and administrative 89,977  78,151  11,826  15.1  % Intangible asset amortization 12,796  8,229  4,567  55.5  % Operating income 231,580  268,428  (36,848) (13.7) % Interest expense, net 9,488  6,918  2,570  37.1  % Other (income) and expense, net

The decrease in net sales is primarily attributed to decreased average selling prices across the Company’s products of $108.3 million and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of $7.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of $61.3 million from companies acquired during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 and increased sales volume of $45.6 million. Average selling prices have declined as the Company continues to see normalization of pricing.
Cost of sales % Change Volume 6.0  % Average input costs (12.3) % Foreign exchange (1.3) % Acquisitions 8.6  % Other 1.8  % Cost of sales 2.8  % Cost of sales increased by $13.5 million, or 2.8%, to $499.5 million for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $486.0 million for the three months ended December 24, 2021.
The increase was primarily due to recent acquisitions during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 of $41.2 million and higher sales volume of $29.0 million. This was partially offset by lower input costs of steel, copper and PVC resin of $59.2 million. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11.8 million, or 15.1%, to $90.0 million for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $78.2 million for the three months ended December 24, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased general spending on business improvement initiatives of $5.7 million, recent acquisitions in fiscal 2022 and 2023 of $5.5 million and $2.1 million spread across a variety of other spend categories, partially offset by lower variable compensation of $1.1 million and by lower transaction costs of $0.4 million,
Intangible asset amortization
Intangible asset amortization expense increased to $12.8 million for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $8.2 million for the three months ended December 24, 2021. Increased amortization expense resulted from additional intangible assets acquired in business combinations in fiscal 2022 and 2023. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net increased by $2.6 million, or 37.1% to $9.5 million for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $6.9 million for the three months ended December 24, 2021.
The increase is primarily due to increased interest rates on our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. 22 Other (income) and expense, net
Other (income) and expense, net decreased to $0.0 million other expense for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $0.3 million other income for the three months ended December 24, 2021.
Income tax expense The Company ’ s income tax rate increased to 21.9% for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to 21.8% for the three months ended December 24, 2021. The increase in the current period effective tax rate was driven by a decrease in the excess tax benefit associated with stock compensation offset by a decrease in state tax expense.
SEGMENT RESULTS The Electrical segment manufactures high quality products used in the construction of electrical power systems including conduit, cable and installation accessories.
This segment serves contractors in partnership with the electrical wholesale channel. The Safety & Infrastructure segment designs and manufactures solutions including metal framing, mechanical pipe, perimeter security and cable management for the protection and reliability of critical infrastructure.
These solutions are marketed to contractors, original equipment manufacturers and end users. Both segments use Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of profit and loss. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is income (loss) before income taxes, adjusted to exclude unallocated expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, certain legal matters, and other items, such as inventory reserves and adjustments, (gain) loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, insurance recovery related to damages of property, plant and equipment, release of indemnified uncertain tax positions, realized or unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency impacts of intercompany loans and related forward currency derivatives, gain on purchase of business, restructuring costs and transaction costs.

The decrease in net sales is primarily attributed to decreased average selling prices of $66.7 million and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of $7.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of $55.2 million from companies acquired during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 and increased sales volume of $17.5 million, primarily in the metal electrical conduit and fittings and electrical cable and flexible conduit product lines.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 30, 2022 decreased by $35.7 million, or 12.8%, to $243.8 million from $279.5 million for the three months ended December 24, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA margins decreased to 38.2% for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to 43.6% for the three months ended December 24, 2021.
The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins was largely due to lower average selling prices over input costs. Safety & Infrastructure Three months ended (in thousands) December 30, 2022 December 24, 2021 Change % Change Net sales $ 195,259  $ 200,510  $ (5,251) (2.6) % Adjusted EBITDA $ 33,404  $ 27,432  $ 5,972  21.8  % Adjusted EBITDA margin 17.1  % 13.7  %           Net sales % Change Volume 13.9  % Average selling prices (20.6) % Acquisitions 3.0  % Other 1.1  % Net sales (2.6) % Net sales decreased by $5.3 million, or 2.6%, for the three months ended December 30, 2022 to $195.3 million compared to $200.5 million for the three months ended December 24, 2021. The decrease is primarily attributed to decreased average selling prices of $41.6 million driven by lower input costs of steel partially offset by higher volumes of $28.1 million, primarily in the construction and metal framing product lines, and increased net sales of $6.1 million from companies acquired during fiscal 2022. Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased by $6.0 million, or 21.8%, to $33.4 million for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to $27.4 million for the three months ended December 24, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 17.1% for the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to 13.7% for the three months ended December 24, 2021.
The Adjusted EBITDA increase is primarily due to average selling prices declining slower than input costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operations and to invest in future growth and create value for stockholders. Our cash and cash equivalents were $307.8 million as of December 30, 2022, of which $62.5 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. Those cash balances at foreign
24 subsidiaries may be subject to withholding or local country taxes if the Company ’ s intention to permanently reinvest such income were to change and cash was repatriated to the United States. In general, we require cash to fund working capital investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt repayment, interest payments, taxes and share repurchases. We have access to the ABL Credit Facility to fund operational needs. As of December 30, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility and $12.1 million of letters of credit issued under the ABL Credit Facility. The borrowing base was estimated to be $325.0 million and approximately $312.9 million was available under the ABL Credit Facility as of December 30, 2022. Outstanding letters of credit count as utilization of the commitments under the ABL Credit Facility and reduce the amount available for borrowings.      The agreements governing the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the ABL Credit Facility (collectively, the "Credit Facilities") contain covenants that limit or restrict AII’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase debt, incur liens, sell assets, make certain payments (including dividends) and enter into transactions with affiliates. AII has been in compliance with the covenants under the agreements for all periods presented. We may from time to time repurchase our debt or take other steps to reduce our debt. These actions may include open market repurchases, negotiated repurchases or opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt, if any, that may be repurchased or refinanced will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our use of cash may fluctuate during the year and from year to year due to differences in demand and changes in economic conditions primarily related to the prices of the commodities we purchase. Capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand and update the production capacity and improve the productivity of our manufacturing operations.
Our ongoing liquidity needs are expected to be funded by cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and, as required, borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. We expect that cash provided from operations and available capacity under the ABL Credit Facility will provide sufficient funds to operate our business, make expected capital expenditures and meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months, including payments of interest and principal on our debt.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Limitations on distributions and dividends by subsidiaries      AI, AII, and AIH are each holding companies, and as such have no independent operations or material assets other than ownership of equity interests in their respective subsidiaries. On December 31, 2022, AIH merged into AII, with AII being the surviving entity. Each company depends on its respective subsidiaries to distribute funds to it so that it may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and dividends to us depends on their operating results, cash requirements and financial and general business conditions, as well as restrictions under the laws of our subsidiaries' jurisdictions. The agreements governing the Credit Facilities significantly restrict the ability of our subsidiaries, including AII, to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets from AII and, in turn, to us. Further, AII's subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the Credit Facilities to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to AII and, in turn, to us. The Senior Secured Term Loan Facility requires AII to meet a certain consolidated coverage ratio on an incurrence basis in connection with additional indebtedness. The ABL Credit Facility contains limits on additional indebtedness based on various conditions for incurring the additional debt. AII has been in compliance with the covenants under the agreements for all periods presented. 25 The table below summarizes cash flow information derived from our statements of cash flows for the periods indicated: Three months ended (in thousands) December 30, 2022 December 24, 2021 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 198,851  $ 97,192  Investing activities (117,187) (45,024) Financing activities (164,831) (129,048)      Operating activities      During the three months ended December 30, 2022, the Company was provided $198.9 million by operating activities compared to $97.2 million during the three months ended December 24, 2021. The $101.7 million increase in cash provided was primarily due to $81.5 million decrease in cash used in working capital primarily due to lower inventory and accounts receivable as well as $47.2 million of tax impacts, partially offset by decreased operating income. Investing activities During the three months ended December 30, 2022, the Company used $117.2 million in investing activities compared to $45.0 million during the three months ended December 24, 2021. Cash used in acquisitions increased in fiscal 2022 by $46.1 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of Elite Polymer in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
The remaining increase in cash used in investing activities was driven by $25.6 million of additional capital expenditures.      Financing Activities      During the three months ended December 30, 2022, the Company used $164.8 million in financing activities compared to $129.0 million used during the three months ended December 24, 2021. The increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to $45.5 million more cash used to repurchase common stock during the three months ended December 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource
28 constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 29 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
