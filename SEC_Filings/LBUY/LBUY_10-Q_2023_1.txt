Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 1 — Description of Business   Description of Business   The Company was founded in 2012 by a group of technology and industry veterans and provides online resources for cannabis deals and specials. Our headquarters is located in Greenwood Village, Colorado.   Our subsidiary, LB Media Group, LLC has evolved and grown as a listing website to a comprehensive marketing technology platform. Our clients, medical and recreational dispensaries in legalized cannabis states, along with cannabis product companies subscribe to our technology platform to assist in new customer acquisition and provide retention tools that include texting/loyalty and order ahead technology.
Basis of Presentation   The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, has been derived from audited financial statements. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements being audited and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial statements. In the opinion of management, such unaudited information includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of this interim information. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Operating results and cash flows for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that can be expected for the entire year. The Company uses the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. The information included in this report should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto.   Going Concern   As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 298,243
in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $ 2,348,295 . We are dependent on funds raised through equity financing. Our cumulative net loss of $ 23,965,065
was funded by debt and equity financing and we reported a net loss from operations of $ 114,578
for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.   Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating profitable operations in the future and / or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management believes that actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan of expansion of products, geographical locations we sell our services and deeper market penetration will generate additional revenues and eventually positive cash flow and provide opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate additional revenues and our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.     7 Table of Contents       Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles of Consolidation   The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, LB Media. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
For a detailed discussion about the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2 — “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s June 30, 2022 Form 10-K. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were no significant changes made to the Company’s significant accounting policies   Use of Estimates   Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Examples of estimates include loss contingencies; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Reclassifications   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.   Earnings (Loss) per Share   Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted loss per share is computed similarly to basic loss per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities are exercised. Dilutive instruments had no effect on the calculation of earnings or loss per share during the six months ended December 31, 2022. For the six months ended December 31, 2021 warrants of
29,119,898 , stock options vested as of the end of the period of
7,471,867 , Convertible Debt into
13,776,244
shares and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
116,525,995
shares of common stock would have been included in the fully diluted weighted average calculation.   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326),
which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The pronouncement will be effective for public business entities that are SEC filers in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The effect of the adoption of this pronouncement to the Company was immaterial.   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). ASU 2020-06 requires entities to provide expanded disclosures about the terms and features of convertible instruments and reduces the number of accounting models for convertible instruments and allows more contracts to qualify for equity classification. The pronouncement will be effective for public business entities that are SEC filers in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted but no earlier than fiscal years beginning December 15, 2020.   No other recent accounting pronouncements were issued by FASB and the SEC that are believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future condensed consolidated financial statements.     8 Table of Contents

(“GTI”) from its shareholders. At the time of the transaction, there were no employees working for GTI, no systems and no assets, other than the Loyalty Software. GTI’s legal entity will be dissolved in the transition and the Loyalty Software will be assumed by the Company. Management determined that the purchase of GTI did not constitute a business purchase and recorded the transaction as a purchase of software. The consideration for the Loyalty Software was
2,916,667
shares of common stock and cash of approximately $ 450,000 . Total value of the Loyalty Software was estimated at approximately $ 3,010,000 . The additional consideration for future developments will be evaluated and considered enhancements which will either be capitalized to the software or expensed as research and development costs. During the year ended June 30, 2020 additional Incentive Shares of
366,667
for a value of $ 262,500
was issued to shareholders of GTI as final settlement of the 2018 agreement. During the period ended December 31, 2022 there was no software capitalized and for the same period ended 2021.   GTI provides cannabis consumers real-time mobile ordering and loyalty rewards through an internally developed application that integrates with the local dispensary’s point of sale system. The Company plans to fully integrate this technology into the current platform and create an “Ultimate Bundle” of services for the cannabis industry. The current revenues of GTI are minimal, and the Company expects higher sales in the California market as the system is fully integrated.

which was an increase from September 30, 2020 of $ 838,303 . The difference was recorded as an unrealized loss on the consolidated statement of operations as of December 31, 2021 compared to a loss for this same period in 2020 of $ 3,714,877 .

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     Forward Looking Statements   This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions.   While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. Except as required by applicable law, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.   Our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are expressed in US dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. They reflect all adjustments (all of which are normal and recurring in nature) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of our interim financial information. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes included therein have been prepared on a basis consistent with and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes for the year ended June 30, 2022, as filed in our annual report on Form 10-K.   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our interim financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report.   Business Overview   Our wholly owned subsidiary, LB Media Group, LLC has evolved and grown from a listing website to a comprehensive marketing technology platform. We work with both, medical and recreational dispensaries, in legalized cannabis states along with cannabis product companies.  Through subscription and pay per use models we provide  access to our technology platform which includes retention tools, applications, texting/loyalty and ordering ahead technology.
The Leafbuyer Technology Platform reaches millions of cannabis consumers every month through its web-based platform, loyalty platform and smart application technology. Our website’s sophisticated vendor dashboard allows our clients to update their menus, deals and create real-time messages to communicate with consumers 24/7/365. The platform also provides a robust reporting feature to track the vendors’ return on investment. With the increased popularity of Leafbuyer texting/loyalty program, clients can communicate through SMS, MMS as well as push notifications within a custom branded application. Our website, Leafbuyer.com, and its progressive web application, hosts a robust search algorithm like popular travel or hotel sites, where our clients' customers can search the database for appealing offers. They can also search through thousands of menu items and products, create a profile, sign up to receive deal alerts and place online orders for pick up or delivery. In November of 2020 Leafbuyer Technologies Inc. completed a customizable white label application for the dispensary clients. Consumers can search, shop, earn rewards, place orders, and communicate with their favorite stores all in one convenient application. The application can also be completely branded for the dispensary and allows for 24/7 communication with their patrons.     15 Table of Contents
We continue an aggressive push into all legal cannabis states. Increasing our marketing and sales presence in new markets is a primary objective. Along with this expansion, we continue to develop innovative technologies that will serve cannabis dispensaries and product companies in attracting and retaining consumers.   Leafbuyer operates in a rapidly evolving and highly regulated industry that, as has been estimated by grandviewresearch.com, to exceed $70 billion in revenue by the year 2028. Our founders and our Board of Directors have been, and will continue to be, aggressive in pursuing long-term opportunities.   We plan to grow organically through the aggressive deployment of sales and marketing resources into legal cannabis states. We understand that to obtain a significant market share we may need to look for acquisitions for a sizable portion of that growth.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and acquire such opportunities or that they will be on terms that are favorable to us. In the meantime the company will continue to look for efficiencies, analyze areas for cost cutting as well as developing new products to increase revenue streams.         The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   Comparison of results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021       Three months Ended December 31,                   2022     2021     Change     %   Revenue   $ 1,341,750     $ 923,829     $ 417,921       45 % Cost of revenue     625,604       662,059       (36,455 )     (6 )% Gross profit     716,146       261,770       454,376       174 %                                   Total operating expenses     579,978       750,675       (170,097

Other income during the period ended December 31, 2021 was the result of the SBA PPP loan forgiveness of $577,977.
Net Income   During the six months ended December 31, 2022 we realized a net loss of $114,576, compared to a net income of $1,585,128 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements with existing cash on hand and/or the private placement of common stock or obtaining debt financing. There is, however, no assurance that the Company will be able to raise any additional capital through any type of offering on terms acceptable to the Company, as existing cash on hand will be insufficient to finance operations over the next twelve months.   At December 31, 2022 we had $298,243 in cash and cash equivalents.
Cash Flows   Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows:       Six months Ended December,       2022     2021   Net cash used in operating activities   $ 76,643   $ (232,388
) Net cash used in investing activities   $ -     $ -   Net cash provided by financing activities   $ (145,644
)   $ -     As of December 31, 2022, we had $298,243 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $2,348,295. We are dependent on funds raised through equity financing. Our cumulative net loss of $23,965,065 was funded by debt and equity financing and we reported a net loss from operations of $114,578 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. During the six months ending December 31, 2022, we did not raise or expended any monies through financing activities, and we did not expend any monies through investing activities (acquiring assets).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.     18 Table of Contents
Critical Accounting Estimates   Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in our June 30, 2022 form 10-K in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Critical Accounting Policies   Our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. For a detailed discussion about the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2 — “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s June 30, 2022 Form 10-K. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by our management. Management has carefully considered the recently issued accounting pronouncements that altered generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any other new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial position or operations in the near term.   Use of Estimates   Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Revenue Recognition   For revenue recognition arrangements that we determine are within the scope of Topic ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we evaluate the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.   We recognize revenue upon completion of our performance obligations or expiration of the contractual time to use services such as bulk texting.
Recent Accounting Guidance Adopted
We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and applicable to us. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on our financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.     19 Table of Contents
