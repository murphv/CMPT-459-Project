Amesite Inc.
Notes
to Condensed Financial Statements
December 31, 2022 and 2021
Note 1 - Nature of Business and Liquidity
Amesite Inc. (the “Company”)
was incorporated in November 2017. The Company is an artificial intelligence driven platform and course designer, that provides customized,
high performance and scalable online products for schools and businesses. The Company uses machine learning to provide a novel, mass customized
experience to learners. The Company’s customers are businesses, universities and colleges, and K-12 schools. The Company’s
activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The Company’s operations are considered to be in
one
segment.
On September 18, 2020, we consummated
a reorganizational merger, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated July 14, 2020 (“Effective
Date”), whereby we merged with and into Amesite Inc. (“Amesite Parent”) our former parent corporation, with our Company
resulting as the surviving entity. In connection with the same, we filed a Certificate of Ownership and Merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, and changed our name from “Amesite Operating Company” to “Amesite Inc.” The stockholders
of Amesite Parent approved the Merger Agreement on August 4, 2020. The directors and officers of Amesite Parent became our directors and
officers.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on
the Effective Date, each share of the Amesite parent’s common stock, $ 0.0001
par value per share, issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Date, was converted, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of our common stock.
Additionally, each option or warrant
to acquire shares of Amesite Parent outstanding immediately before the Effective Date was converted into and became an equivalent option
to acquire shares of our common stock, upon the same terms and conditions.
Going Concern
The accompanying condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The
Company is developing its customer base and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover
its expenses. The Company has had a history of net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expects
to continue to incur net losses and use cash in its operations in the foreseeable future.
In
addition, the Company has received a notice from the Nasdaq related to their failure to maintain a minimum bid price of $ 1
per share.
The Company is not currently in compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules and if the Company does not regain compliance by March 6, 2023,
the common stock of the Company will become subject to delisting. If the Company’s common stock is delisted, it may affect the Company’s
ability to obtain financing, trade or sell shares of their common stock, and/or forecasted operations could be negatively impacted in
an amount that the Company cannot currently quantify.
The assessment of the Company’s
ability to meet its future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change.
Based
on their current forecast, management believes that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to maintain the Company’s
planned operations for the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements; however, there is uncertainty in the
forecast and therefore the Company cannot assert that it is probable. The Company has considered both quantitative and qualitative factors
that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date of these financial statements are issued and concluded that there are conditions
present in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In
response to the conditions, management plans include generating cash by completing financing transactions, which may include offerings
of common stock. However, these plans are subject to market conditions, and are not within the Company’s control, and therefore,
cannot be deemed probable. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in implementing their plans. As a result, the Company
has concluded that management’s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.
The condensed financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
- 7 -
Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The condensed financial statements of
the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
and considering the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company has a fiscal
year with a June 30 year end.
In the opinion of management, the condensed
financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include all
adjustments and accruals, consisting only of normal, recurring accrual adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the
results for the interim periods. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed in or omitted from this report pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the SEC. These financial statements should be read together with the condensed financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair
Value Measurements
Accounting
standards require certain assets and liabilities be reported at fair value in the financial statements and provide a framework for establishing
that fair value. The framework for determining fair value is based on a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure fair value.
Fair
values determined by Level 1 inputs use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access.
Fair
values determined by Level 2 inputs use other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These Level 2 inputs include
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable
at commonly quoted intervals.
Level
3 inputs are unobservable inputs, including inputs that are available in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for
the related asset. These Level 3 fair value measurements are based primarily on management’s own estimates using pricing models,
discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.
In
instances wherein inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels in the above fair value hierarchy, fair value measurements
in their entirety are categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation. The Company’s assessment
of the significance of particular inputs to these fair value measurements requires judgment and considers factors specific to each asset
or liability.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The total amount
of bank deposits (checking and savings accounts) that was insured by the FDIC at year end was $ 250,000 .
Income
Taxes
A
current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the year. Deferred tax liabilities
or assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax accounting.
Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not
be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

Technology
and Content Development
Technology
and content development expenditures consist primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense and contracted services associated with
the maintenance of our platform as well as hosting and licensing costs and are charged to expense as incurred. It also includes amortization
of capitalized software costs and research and development costs related to improving our platform and creating content that are charged
to expense as incurred.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. The straight-line method is used for computing depreciation and amortization. Assets are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. The cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated (amortized) over the lesser of the length of the
related leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
Depreciable

Capitalized Software Costs
The Company capitalizes costs incurred
in the development of software for internal use, including the costs of the software, materials, consultants, and payroll and payroll
related costs for employees incurred in developing internal use computer software. Planning costs incurred prior to the development of
software and costs not qualifying for capitalization are charged to expense. The Company amortizes capitalized software over a period
of three years, which is the expected useful life of the software. The Company recognized amortization expense of approximately $ 350,000
and $ 424,000
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Accumulated amortization on December, 2022 and 2021 was
$ 2,533,000
and $ 1,762,000 , respectively.
Revenue Recognition
We generate substantially all of our
revenue from contractual arrangements with businesses, colleges and universities to provide a comprehensive platform of integrated technology
and technology enabled services related to product offerings.
During the six months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenue from contracts with customers of approximately $ 517,000  and $ 330,000 , respectively, of which
$ 77,000  and $ 14,000 , respectively, related to services transferred at a point in time and the remainder related to services provided
over time.
Performance Obligations and Timing
of Recognition
A performance obligation is a promise
in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct
performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
We derive revenue from annual licensing
arrangements, including maintenance fees, setup fees and other variable fees for course development and miscellaneous items. Our contracts
with partners generally have two-year terms and have a single performance obligation. The promises to set up and provide a hosted platform
of tightly integrated technology and services partners needed to attract, enroll, educate, and support students are not distinct within
the context of the contracts. This performance obligation is satisfied as the partners receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably
over the contract term.
- 9 -
Occasionally, we will provide professional
services, such as custom development, non-complex implementation activities, training, and other various professional services. We evaluate
these services to determine if they are distinct and separately identifiable in the context of the contract. In our contracts with customers
that contain multiple performance obligations as a result of this assessment, we allocate the transaction price to each separate performance
obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices of our solutions and services are typically estimated
based on observable transactions when the solutions or services are sold on a standalone basis. When standalone selling prices are not
observable, we utilize a cost plus margin approach to allocate the transaction price.
We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied
performance obligations because the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service
that forms part of a single performance obligation (i.e., consideration received is based on the level of product offerings, which is
unknown in advance). For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, all of the revenue recognized has been recognized over the related
contract periods. Additionally, for the six months ended December 31, 2022, five customers comprised approximately
70 % of total revenue.
During the six months ended December 31, 2021, one customer comprised approximately
20 % of total revenue.
We also receive fees that are fixed
in nature, such as annual license and maintenance charges, in place of or in conjunction with variable consideration. The fees are independent
of the number of students that are enrolled in courses with our customers and are allocated to and recognized ratably over the service
period of the contract that the Company’s platform is made available to the customer (i.e. the customer simultaneously receives
and consumes the benefit of the software over the contract service period).
The following factors affect the nature,
amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows:
●
The majority of our customers are private and public learning institutions across various domestic regions
●
The majority of our customers have annual payment terms
Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets
and Liabilities
Balance sheet items related to contracts
consist of accounts receivable (net) and contract liabilities on our condensed balance sheets. Accounts receivable (net) is stated at
net realizable value, and we utilize the allowance method to provide for doubtful accounts based on management’s evaluation of the
collectability of the amounts due. Our estimates are reviewed and revised periodically based on historical collection experience and a
review of the current status of accounts receivable. Historically, actual write-offs for uncollectible accounts have not significantly
differed from prior estimates. There was no allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2022 or June
30, 2022.
We may recognize revenue prior to billing
a customer when we have satisfied or partially satisfied our performance obligations as billings to our customers may not be made until
after the service period has commenced. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we do not have any contract assets.
Contract liabilities as of each balance
sheet date represent the excess of amounts billed or received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on our condensed statements
of operations as of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on our condensed balance sheets
as deferred revenue. We generally receive payments prior to completion of the service period and our performance obligations. These payments
are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered or until our obligations are otherwise met, at which time revenue is
recognized.
Some contracts also involve annual license
fees, for which upfront amounts are received from customers. In these contracts, the license fees received in advance of the platform’s
launch are recorded as contract liabilities.

approximately $ 207,000
and $ 164,000 , respectively.
The deferred revenue balance as of December
31, 2022 is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.
Net Loss per Share
Basic net loss per share is calculated
by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per
share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the treasury stock
or modified treasury stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period.
At
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had  4,710,262  and  4,922,007  potentially
dilutive shares of common stock related to common stock options and warrants, respectively, as determined using the if-converted method.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the dilutive effect of common stock options and common stock warrants has not been
included in the average shares outstanding for the calculation of net loss per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive as a result
of our net losses in these periods .
Stock-Based Compensation
We have issued three types of stock-based
awards under our stock plans: stock options, restricted stock units and stock warrants. All stock-based awards granted to employees, directors
and independent contractors are measured at fair value at each grant date. We rely on the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating
the fair value of stock-based awards granted, and expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock
prices. Stock options generally vest over two years from the grant date and generally have ten-year contractual terms. Restricted stock
units generally have a term of 12 months from the closing date of the agreement. Stock warrants issued have a term of
five years . Information
about the assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation expense is set forth in Note 3 in the Notes to Financial Statements.
Risks and Uncertainties
The Company operates in an industry
subject to rapid change. The Company’s operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational,
technological, and other risks associated with an early-stage company, including the potential risk of business failure.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization declared the outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus as a “pandemic.” First identified
in late 2019 and known now as COVID-19, the outbreak has impacted thousands of individuals worldwide. In response, many countries, including
the United States, have implemented measures to combat the outbreak which have impacted global business operations. While management believes
the Company’s operations have not been significantly impacted, the Company continues to monitor the situation. In addition, while
the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted, the extent of the impact cannot
be reasonably estimated at this time.
- 11 -
Note 3 - Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s Equity Incentive
Plan (the “Plan”) permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, or restricted stock units
to officers, employees, directors, consultants, agents, and independent contractors of the Company. The Company believes that such awards
better align the interests of its employees, directors, and consultants with those of its stockholders. Option awards are generally granted
with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant; those option awards generally vest
over two years from the grant date and generally have ten-year contractual terms. Certain option awards provide for accelerated vesting
(as defined in the Plan).
The Company has reserved
4,600,000
shares
of common stock to be available for granting under the Plan.
The Company estimates the fair value
of each option award using a Black Scholes Model (“BSM”) that uses the weighted average assumptions included in the table
below. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of comparable companies. The Company uses historical data to estimate
option exercise within the valuation model or estimates the expected option exercise when historical data is unavailable. The risk-free
rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The
Company has not paid any dividends on common stock since its inception and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock in
the foreseeable future. When calculating the amount of annual compensation expense, the Company has elected not to estimate forfeitures
and instead accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

For the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $ 15,600
and $ 422,526 , in expense related to the Plan, respectively. For the six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $ 191,379
and $ 811,611 , in expense related to the Plan, respectively.

On September 28, 2021, the Board approved
certain stock awards to its board members in the form of stock options and restricted stock.
The stock option awards vested ratably
over the twelve-month period from beginning September 28, 2021 through September 28, 2022. The total approved compensation was $ 172,702
in stock options. The number of options was determined based on the fair value of the Company’s share price as of the date of grant.
The Company determined that there will be
337,078
of restricted shares issued upon vesting, based on the fair value of the Company’s
share price on the grant date.
The restricted stock awards vested over
a twelve-month period beginning July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. The total approved compensation was $ 600,000
in restricted stock.
Accordingly, $ 56,500
and $ 156,175
related
to the stock option grants made to the board members, was recognized as stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months
ended December 31, 2022. The Company also recognized ($ 150,000 ) and $ 0
as stock-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock
unit grants made to the board members for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
Beginning in January 2022, additional
Board of Directors compensation at the rate of $ 305,500
annually was implemented with Directors opting for receipt via stock options under
the Equity Incentive Plan or cash. For the year ended December 31, 2022, $ 226,000
in stock option grants were awarded and $ 79,500
of cash
payments were made. The Company recognized $ 56,500
and $ 113,000
as stock-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock unit
grants made to the board members for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately
$ 1,464,000
of total unrecognized compensation cost for employees and non-employees related to nonvested options. These costs are expected
to be recognized through December 2026.
Note 4 – Warrants
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30,
2022, there were 1,590,739 and 1,421,739 warrants outstanding, respectively. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
Company issued $169,000 and 63,489 common stock warrants, respectively, to a placement agent related to fundraisings and other advisory
services. The warrants are fully vested, have a term of 5 years from closing date of the private placements and an exercise price of $1.00
per share (2022 warrants) and $6.00 per share (2021 warrants) , respectively (see Note 4 for additional terms of the warrants).

Note 5 - Income Taxes
For the six months ended December 31,
2022 and prior periods since inception, the Company’s activities have not generated taxable income or tax liabilities. Accordingly,
the Company has not recognized an income tax benefit on the Condensed Statements of Operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021.
The Company has approximately $ 31,500,000
of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future income taxes, of which approximately $ 17,000
of net operating loss carryforwards
expire in 2037. Due to uncertainty as to the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets as a result
of the Company’s limited operating history and operating losses since inception, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against
the Company’s deferred tax assets.
Note 6 - Convertible Notes Payable
In April and May 2020, the Company issued
unsecured, convertible notes payable (the “Notes”) to certain accredited investors, with an aggregate principal amount of
$ 2,182,500 , in an offering intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
thereof and Regulation D thereunder.
The Notes were unsecured, bore interest
at  8 % per annum, and matured  one year  from their dates of issuance. The Notes were subject to automatic conversion into
the Company’s common stock upon a qualified equity financing or change of control, based on a specified formula for the conversion
price; using the lesser of $ 2.00  or
75 % of the price paid per share in either of the conversion events.
The Company incurred issuance costs
of $ 261,900 . The issuance costs were amortized over six months, which was the estimated length of time that the Company believed the Notes
would be outstanding until a conversion event occurred.
Note 7 - Subsequent Events
On February 15, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders
(the “Special Meeting”) for the purpose of holding a stockholder vote on the following proposals: (i) To grant discretionary
authority to our board of directors to (i) amend our certificate of incorporation to combine outstanding shares of our common stock
into a lesser number of outstanding shares, or a “reverse stock split,” at a specific ratio within a range of one-for-five
(1-for-5) to a maximum of a one-for-fifty (1-for-50) split, with the exact ratio to be determined by our board of directors in its sole
discretion; and (ii)  effect the reverse stock split, if at all, within one year of the date the proposal is approved by stockholders ;
and (ii) To approve an amendment the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) to
(a) increase the number
of shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan by 3,000,000 shares and (b) increase the amount of shares that may be issued pursuant
to the exercise of incentive stock options by 3,000,000 shares.
The reverse stock split proposal and the amendment to the Company’s
2018 Plan were each approved by the requisite vote of the Company’s stockholders.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended June 30, 2022
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on September 28, 2022. In addition
to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We
discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
including those factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and
in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A.
Overview
The following discussion highlights our results
of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding
of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on
our unaudited condensed financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which we have prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial
statements and the related notes thereto.
We are not currently profitable, and we cannot
provide any assurance that we will ever be profitable. We incurred a net loss of $699,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022,
and we incurred a net loss of $23,800,000 for the period from November 14, 2017 (date of incorporation) to December 31, 2022.
The assessment of the Company’s ability
to meet its future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. Based on their current forecast, management
believes that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to maintain the Company’s planned operations for the next twelve
months following the issuance of these financial statements; however, there is uncertainty in the forecast
and
therefore the Company cannot assert that it is probable . The Company has considered both quantitative and qualitative factors that
are known or reasonably knowable as of the date of these financial statements are issued and concluded that there are conditions present
in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In response to the conditions, management plans
include generating cash by completing financing transactions, which may include offerings of common stock. However, these plans are subject
to market conditions, and are not within the Company’s control, and therefore, cannot be deemed probable. There is no assurance
that the Company will be successful in implementing their plans. As a result, the Company has concluded that management’s plans
do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
- 15 -
Basis of Presentation
The financial statements contained herein have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP and the requirements of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
This management’s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions
differ from our assumptions. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the “Notes to Condensed
Financial Statements,” we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments
and estimates in preparation of our financial statements.
Internally-Developed Capitalized Software
We capitalize certain costs related to internal-use
software, primarily consisting of direct labor and third-party vendor costs associated with creating the software. Software development
projects generally include three stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are expensed as incurred), the application development
stage (certain costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-implementation/operation stage (all costs
are expensed as incurred). Costs capitalized in the application development stage include costs related to the design and implementation
of the selected software components, software build and configuration infrastructure, and software interfaces. Capitalization of costs
requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the application development stage, the proportion of time spent in the application
development stage, and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software is placed in service,
these costs are amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three years.
Stock-Based Compensation
We have issued three
types of stock-based awards under our stock plans: stock options, restricted stock units and stock warrants. All stock-based awards granted
to employees, directors and independent contractors are measured at fair value at each grant date. We rely on the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for estimating the fair value of stock-based awards granted, and expected volatility is based on the historical volatility
of the Company’s stock prices. Stock options generally vest over two years from the grant date and generally have ten-year contractual
terms. Restricted stock units generally have a term of 12 months from the closing date of the agreement. Stock warrants issued have a
term of five years. Information about the assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation expense is set forth in Note
3 in the Notes to Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
We generate substantially all our revenue from
contractual arrangements with businesses, colleges and universities and K-12 schools to provide a comprehensive platform of tightly integrated
technology and technology enabled services related to product offerings.
Revenue related to our
licensing arrangements is generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing upon platform delivery. Revenue related to licensing
arrangements recognized in a given time period will consist of contracts that went live in the current period or that went live in previous
periods and are currently ongoing.
- 16 -
Performance Obligations and Timing of Recognition
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract
to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance
obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
We derive revenue from annual licensing arrangements,
including maintenance fees, setup fees and other variable fees for course development and miscellaneous items. Our contracts with partners
generally have two-year terms and have a single performance obligation. The promises to set up and provide a hosted platform of tightly
integrated technology and services partners need to attract, enroll, educate and support students are not distinct within the context
of the contracts. This performance obligation is satisfied as the partners receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably over the
contract term.
Occasionally, we will provide professional services,
such as custom development, non-complex implementation activities, training, and other various professional services. We evaluate these
services to determine if they are distinct and separately identifiable in the context of the contract. In our contracts with Customers
that contain multiple performance obligations because of this assessment, we allocate the transaction price to each separate performance
obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices of our solutions and services are typically estimated
based on observable transactions when the solutions or services are sold on a standalone basis. When standalone selling prices are not
observable, we utilize a cost-plus margin approach to allocate the transaction price.
We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance
obligations because the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service that forms
part of a single performance obligation (i.e., consideration received is based on the level of product offerings, which is unknown in
advance).
We also receive fees that are fixed in nature,
such as annual license and maintenance charges, in place of or in conjunction with variable consideration. The fees are independent of
the number of students that are enrolled in courses with our customers and are allocated to and recognized ratably over the service period
of the contract that the Company’s platform is made available to the customer (i.e. the customer simultaneously receives and consumes
the benefit of the software over the contract service period).
The following factors affect the nature, amount,
timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows:
●
The majority of our customers are private and public learning institutions across various domestic regions
●
The majority of our customers have annual payment terms
Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Liabilities
Balance sheet items related to contracts consist
of accounts receivable (net) and contract liabilities on our condensed balance sheets. Accounts receivable (net) is stated at net realizable
value, and we utilize the allowance method to provide for doubtful accounts based on management’s evaluation of the collectability
of the amounts due. Our estimates are reviewed and revised periodically based on historical collection experience and a review of the
current status of accounts receivable. Historically, actual write-offs for uncollectible accounts have not significantly differed from
prior estimates. There was no allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022.
We may recognize revenue prior to billing a customer
when we have satisfied or partially satisfied our performance obligations as billings to our customers may not be made until after the
service period has commenced. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, we do not have any contract assets.
Contract liabilities as of each balance sheet
date represent the excess of amounts billed or received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on our statements of operations as
of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on our balance sheets as deferred revenue. We
generally receive payments prior to completion of the service period and our performance obligations. These payments are recorded as deferred
revenue until the services are delivered or until our obligations are otherwise met, at which time revenue is recognized.
Some contracts also involve annual license fees,
for which upfront amounts are received from Customers. In these contracts, the license fees received in advance of the platform’s
launch are recorded as contract liabilities.

Results of Operations
Revenue
We generated revenues of $237,000 for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $189,174 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. We generated revenues of $517,421
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $329,865 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.Revenue growth compared
to prior year for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by contract renewals.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily
of personnel and personnel-related expenses, including executive management, legal, finance, human resources and other departments that
do not provide direct operational services. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees and other corporate expense.
General and administrative expenses for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 were $316,348 as compared to $1,451,978 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative
expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $1,292,219 as compared to $2,687,748 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease between the three-month periods and the six month periods are primarily due to deliberate cost reductions, including reductions
in headcount and associated administrative costs. These reductions were made possible by completion of certain features and platform capabilities,
that require less staffing to maintain than to build.
Technology and Content Development
Technology and content development expenses consist
primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense and contracted services associated with the ongoing improvement and maintenance of
our platform as well as hosting and licensing costs. Technology and content expense also include the amortization of capitalized software
costs.
Technology and content development expenses for
the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $431,087 as compared to $681,018 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Technology
and content development expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $911,274 as compared to $1,477,126 for the six months
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease between the three-month periods and the six month periods in technology are also principally related
to reductions in headcount and associated administrative costs, since these costs scale with staff. The reductions in the three-month
and six month periods in content development are principally due to completion of certain learning programs that are now offered by our
customers, and require less staffing to maintain than to build.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense consist primarily
of activities to attract Customers to our offerings. This includes personnel and personnel-related expenses, various search engine and
social media costs as well as the cost of advertising.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 were $201,656 as compared to $384,027 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Sales and marketing expenses
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $607,100 as compared to $871,260 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
between the three-month periods and the six month periods in sales and marketing are principally related to refinement of sales and marketing
processes to those that focus messaging directly to our key markets and offer improved lead generation. We have seen increases in marketing
qualified leads (MQLs) in both periods, while reducing the overall sales and marketing spends.
- 18 -
Interest Income
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
interest income totaled $12,508 as compared to interest income of $7,273 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the six months
ended December 31, 2022, interest income totaled $17,958 as compared to interest income of $7,535 for the six months ended December 31,
2021.
Net Loss
Our net loss for the three months ended December
31, 2022 was $699,444 as compared to a net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $2,322,239. Our net loss for the six months
ended December 31, 2022 was $2,276,747 as compared to a net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2021 of $4,700,396. The loss was
substantially lower during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 as a result of deliberate cost savings measures described
above, as we have launched capabilities that are now maintainable and lower cost, adjusted our headcount to reflect the reduced need for
staffing, and improved our sales and marketing efficiency with more targeted, effective messaging.
Capital Expenditures
During the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had capital asset additions of $65,672 and $212,091 respectively, which were comprised of $65,672
and $5,130 respectively, in capitalized technology and content development. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we
had capital asset additions of $175,209 and $500,624 in capitalized technology and content development. [We will continue to capitalize
significant software development costs, comprised primarily of internal payroll, payroll related and contractor costs, as we build out
and complete our technology platforms.]
Financial Position, Liquidity, and Capital
Resources
Overview
We are not currently profitable, and we cannot
provide any assurance that we will ever be profitable, as indicated by our losses noted above.
During the period from November 14, 2017 (date
of incorporation) to September 30, 2020, we raised net proceeds of approximately $11,760,000 from private placement financing transactions
(stock and debt). On September 25, 2020, we completed the Offering of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share,
at an offering price of $5.00 per share (total net proceeds of approximately $12.8 million after underwriting discounts, commissions,
and other offering costs).
On August 2, 2021, we entered into a purchase
agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”), under which, subject
to specified terms and conditions, we may sell up to $16.5 million of shares of common stock. Our net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement
will depend on the frequency of sales and the number of shares sold to Lincoln Park and the prices at which we sell shares to Lincoln
Park. On August 2, 2021, we sold 759,109 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park in an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement
for a total purchase price of $1,500,000. We also issued 152,715 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as consideration for its irrevocable
commitment to purchase our common stock under the Purchase Agreement.
On February 16, 2022, we closed on a public offering
of common stock and received approximately $2.51 million of cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering
costs (Note 6 to the Financial Statements).
On September 1, 2022, we closed on a public offering
of common stock and concurrent private placement of warrants and received approximately $1.85 million of cash proceeds, net of underwriting
discounts, commissions, and other offering costs (Note 6 to the Financial Statements).

As of December 31, 2022, our cash balance totaled
$6,991,236.
The Company is developing its customer base and
has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover its expenses. The Company has had a history
of net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses and use cash
in its operations in the foreseeable future.
In addition, the Company has received a notice
from the Nasdaq related to their failure to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. The Company is not currently in compliance with
the Nasdaq listing rules and if the Company does not regain compliance, the common stock of the Company could be delisted from the Nasdaq
exchange. If the Company’s common stock is delisted, it may affect the Company’s ability to obtain financing, trade or sell
shares of their common stock, and/or forecasted operations could be negatively impacted in an amount that the Company cannot currently
quantify.
The assessment of the Company’s ability
to meet its future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. Based on their current forecast, management
believes that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to maintain the Company’s planned operations for the next twelve
months following the issuance of these financial statements; however, there is uncertainty in the forecast
and
therefore the Company cannot assert that it is probable . The Company has considered both quantitative and qualitative factors that
are known or reasonably knowable as of the date of these financial statements are issued and concluded that there are conditions present
in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In response to the conditions, management plans
include generating cash by completing financing transactions, which may include offerings of common stock. However, these plans are subject
to market conditions, and are not within the Company’s control, and therefore, cannot be deemed probable. There is no assurance
that the Company will be successful in implementing their plans. As a result, the Company has concluded that management’s plans
do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.
The Company is not required to provide the information
required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company.”
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation of, our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer (also our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (also our principal financial and accounting
officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
Material weaknesses were identified in the Company’s
internal controls which were described in our Annual Report on form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on
September 29, 2022. Since then, the Company has undertaken a full risk assessment of its controls utilizing the COSO five-part framework,
has enhanced its control activities around its structure, platforms, procedures, and people, and has implemented monitoring processes.
Except as noted above, there were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
None.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. There have
been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, other than as described
below:
There is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern.
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are in the early stages of developing our customer base and have
not completed our efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover our costs over an extended period of time. For
the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we had net losses of $9,059,923 and $11,586,292, respectively. For the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022, we had net losses of $699,444 and $2,276,747, respectively. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
on our ability to raise additional capital and implement our business plan. On February 16, 2022, we completed a public offering of our
common stock which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $2.51 million. On September 1, 2022, we completed a public offering of our
common stock which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $1.85 million. In addition, on August 2, 2021, we entered into a purchase
agreement (the “Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”), under
which, subject to specified terms and conditions, we may sell up to $16.5 million of shares of common stock. We may raise capital by selling
additional shares to Lincoln Park, however, the net proceeds under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement will depend on the frequency of
sales and the number of shares sold to Lincoln Park and the prices at which we sell shares to Lincoln Park. Based upon our current operations
with our currently available cash balance, management concluded that the current conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern, management concluded it has substantial doubt in its ability to continue as a going concern.
We received a written notice from Nasdaq
that we have failed to comply with certain listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, which could result in our Common Stock being
delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market.
On March 8, 2022, we received a notification from
Nasdaq related to our failure to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. Based on the closing bid price of the Company’s common
stock between January 24, 2022 and March 7, 2022, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement. However, the Nasdaq Listing
Rules also provide us a compliance period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance.
On
September 6, 2022, Nasdaq granted the Company a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance by March 6, 2023 . The Company
is carefully assessing potential actions to regain compliance, including without limitation, holding a special stockholders’ meeting
to solicit approval of a reverse stock split. If we do not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by the end of the
second compliance period, our common stock will become subject to delisting. If we are delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible
for trading on an over-the-counter market. If we are not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for our
common stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their shares. We intend to monitor the closing bid
price of our common stock and may be required to seek approval from our stockholders to affect a reverse stock split of the issued and
outstanding shares of our common stock. However, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split would be approved by our stockholders.
Further, there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of our common stock after the reverse stock split will remain unchanged
or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of our common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split.
Even if the reverse stock split is approved by our stockholders, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing rules.
If we are delisted from Nasdaq, but obtain a substitute
listing for our common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility
than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock on any such substitute market in the quantities,
at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our
common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value and liquidity of our common stock, warrants and pre-funded warrants would likely be significantly
adversely affected. A delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations
and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, employees and/or business partners.
