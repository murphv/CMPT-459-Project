Basis of Presentation The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In management’s opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire fiscal year or any subsequent interim period. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 are to our fiscal years ending September 29, 2023 and ended September 30, 2022, respectively. 2.

308 ​ ​ Fiscal 2023 Actions During fiscal 2023, we initiated a restructuring program associated with cost structure improvements primarily in the Transportation Solutions and Communications Solutions segments. During the quarter ended December 30, 2022, we recorded restructuring charges of $ 105
million in connection with this program. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during the quarter ended December 30, 2022 by the end of fiscal 2024, and we expect additional charges related to the actions commenced during the quarter ended December 30, 2022 to be insignificant.
Fiscal 2022 Actions During fiscal 2022, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and cost structure improvements across all segments. In connection with this program, during the quarter ended December 24, 2021, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $ 33
million. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2022 by the end of fiscal 2024 and to incur additional charges of approximately $ 21
million related primarily to employee severance and facility exit costs.

one
business for a cash purchase price of $ 109
million, net of cash acquired. Due to the timing of the transaction, which was reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment, we preliminarily allocated the purchase price to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Our valuation of identifiable intangible assets, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed is currently in process; therefore, the current allocation is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the valuations. The amount of these potential adjustments could be significant. We acquired
one
business for a cash purchase price of $ 125
million, net of cash acquired, during the quarter ended December 24, 2021. The acquisition was reported as part of our Communications Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. Also during the quarter ended December 24, 2021, we finalized the purchase price allocation of certain fiscal 2021 acquisitions, which included the recognition of $ 25
million of cash acquired. 4. Inventories Inventories consisted of the following: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 30, ​ September 30, ​ ​      2022      2022      ​ ​ (in millions) ​ Raw materials ​ $

Debt As of December 30, 2022, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, had $ 231
million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of
4.70 %. TEGSA had $ 370
million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of
3.45 % at September 30, 2022. The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $ 4,046
million and $ 3,990
million at December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. 8. Leases The components of lease cost were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the ​ ​ ​ Quarters Ended ​ ​ ​ December 30, ​ December 24, ​ ​      2022      2021      ​      (in millions)      Operating lease cost ​ $

Proceedings In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 10
Table of Contents TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) Trade
Compliance
Matters We have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations are ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved. Environmental Matters We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of December 30, 2022, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $ 17  million to $ 44  million, and we accrued $ 20  million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Guarantees In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At December 30, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $ 170  million, excluding those related to our former Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business which are discussed below.
During fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale. These performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately $ 59
million as of December 30, 2022 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2027. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform. 10. Financial Instruments Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk We may utilize cross-currency swap contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. As of fiscal year end 2022, all such cross-currency swap contracts had been terminated or matured and were settled; additionally, all related collateral positions were settled. 11
Table of Contents TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) The impacts of these cross-currency swap contracts were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the ​ ​ ​ Quarter Ended ​ ​ ​ December 24, ​ ​ ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ Losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) ​ $

29 ​ (1) Gains excluded from the hedging relationship are recognized prospectively in selling, general, and administrative expenses and are offset by losses generated as a result of re-measuring certain intercompany loans to the U.S. dollar. Hedge of Net Investment We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $ 2,247
million and $ 1,658  million at December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
We also use a cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the contracts under this program was $ 2,237
million and $ 1,873
million at December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of
1.73 % per annum and pay
no
interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2027, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currency and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. We are not required to provide collateral for these contracts. These cross-currency swap contracts were recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 30, ​ September 30, ​ ​      2022      2022      ​ ​ (in millions) ​ Prepaid expenses and other current assets ​ $

Table of Contents TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) Interest Rate Risk Management We may utilize forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. During fiscal 2022, we terminated forward starting interest rate swap contracts as a result of the issuance of our
2.50 % senior notes due in 2032. The impacts of these forward starting interest rate swap contracts were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the ​ ​ ​ Quarter Ended ​ ​ ​ December 24, ​ ​      2021      ​ ​ (in millions) ​ Gains recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) ​ $
2 ​ ​ Commodity Hedges As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production. These contracts had an aggregate notional value of $ 542
million and $ 566
million at December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, and were designated as cash flow hedges. These commodity swap contracts were recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 30, ​ September 30, ​ ​      2022      2022      ​ ​ (in millions) ​ Prepaid expenses and other current assets ​ $

million and $ 110
million for the quarters ended December 30, 2022 and December 24, 2021, respectively. The income tax expense for the quarter ended December 24, 2021 included a $ 17
million income tax benefit related to the tax impacts of an intercompany transaction and $ 12
million of income tax expense related to an income tax audit of an acquired entity. As we are entitled to indemnification of pre-acquisition period tax obligations under the terms of the purchase agreement, we recorded an associated indemnification receivable and other income of $ 11
million during the quarter ended December 24, 2021.
Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that, as of December 30, 2022, approximately $ 20
million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months. We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2022. 13.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading “Forward-Looking Information” and “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The following discussion includes organic net sales growth (decline) which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” for additional information regarding this measure. Ov erview TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home. Summary of Performance in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2023 ● Our net sales increased 0.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2022 due to sales growth in the Transportation Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment, largely offset by declines in the Communications Solutions segment. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 8.2% during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2022. ● Our net sales by segment were as follows: ● Transportation Solutions —Our net sales increased 4.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due primarily to sales increases in the automotive end market. ● Industrial Solutions —Our net sales increased 0.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 primarily as a result of sales increases in the aerospace, defense, and marine end market and, to a lesser degree, the medical end market, largely offset by declines in the industrial equipment end market. ● Communications Solutions —Our net sales decreased 14.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due to sales declines in the appliances and the data and devices end markets. ● Net cash provided by operating activities was $581 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Economic Conditions Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. The global economy has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. See “Russia-Ukraine Military Conflict” and “COVID-19 Pandemic” for additional information. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. 19
Table of Contents Our business operates globally and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our results. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our net sales by $299 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, and we expect translation to continue to have a negative impact on our operating results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as a result of continued strength of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. We expect translation to negatively impact our net sales by approximately $400 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We have experienced inflationary cost pressures including increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials. However, we have been able to partially mitigate increased costs and supply chain disruptions through price increases or productivity. We have implemented select price increases and have initiated additional price increases for certain products. Also, we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs, including restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending and travel. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. See further discussion in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Russia-Ukraine Military Conflict We are monitoring the continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, escalating tensions in surrounding countries, and associated sanctions. We suspended our business operations in Russia, and our operations in Ukraine have been reduced to focus on the safety of our employees. Neither Russia nor Ukraine represents a material portion of our business, and the military conflict did not have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The full impact of the military conflict on our business operations and financial performance remains uncertain. The extent to which the conflict may impact our business in future periods will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflict, its impact on regional and global economic conditions, and supply chain disruptions. We will continue to actively monitor the conflict and assess the related sanctions and other effects and may take further actions if necessary. COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly all regions around the world, most recently and significantly China, and has resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns. Although the pandemic has impacted certain aspects of our business, we do not expect that it will have a significant impact on our businesses globally in the near term .
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our business operations globally, causing disruption in our suppliers’ and customers’ supply chains and a reduction in demand for certain products from direct customers or end markets. In addition, the pandemic had far-reaching impacts on many additional aspects of our operations, both directly and indirectly, including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, inventory, our employees, and the market generally .
The extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the resurgence of the spread of the virus and variant strains of the virus as well as the success of public health advancements.
While certain of our operations in China were impacted in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and were shut down for a period of time in fiscal 2022, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in fiscal 2023.
However, it may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. Outlook In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect our net sales to be approximately $3.9 billion as compared to $4.0 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. This represents an increase in net sales relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2023
20
Table of Contents with growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, partially offset by a decline in the Communications Solutions segment. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $1.44 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $165 million and $0.11 per share, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Also, this outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.
Acquisition During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $109 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition was reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

9 ​ Net sales increased $23 million, or 0.6%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales resulted primarily from organic net sales growth of 8.2%, largely offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 7.8% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $129 million. See further discussion of net sales below under “Segment Results.” Net Sales by Geographic Region.
Our business operates in three geographic regions—Asia–Pacific, Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”), and the Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. 21

The decrease was primarily a result of the negative impact of foreign currency translation and inflationary pressure on material and operating costs, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing actions. ​ 22
Table of Contents We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, and cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been impacted by worldwide economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures. As a result, we have experienced shortages and price increases in some of our input materials—including copper, gold, silver, and palladium—however, we have been able to initiate pricing actions which have partially offset these impacts. The following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, silver, and palladium: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $29 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 from the same period of fiscal 2022 due primarily to a gain on the sale of real estate in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and the impact of inflation, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation.
Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.
We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth. During fiscal 2023, we initiated a restructuring program associated with cost structure improvements primarily in the Transportation Solutions and Communications Solutions segments. We incurred net restructuring charges of $104 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Annualized cost savings related to the fiscal 2023 actions commenced during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately $86 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2025. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. In fiscal 2023, we expect total restructuring charges and spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to exceed fiscal 2022 levels. As a result of market conditions, we are reevaluating our restructuring actions. We may broaden the scope of our cost reduction initiatives and accelerate cost reduction and footprint consolidation activities. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

9 ​ ​ ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our access to capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of €550 million of 1.10% senior notes due in March 2023. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs. Cash Flows from Operating Activities In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities increased $49 million to $581 million from $532 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase resulted primarily from the impact of changes in working capital levels, partially offset by lower pre-tax income. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $98 million and $71 million, respectively. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital expenditures were $183 million and $172 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect fiscal 2023 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $109 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $125 million, net of cash acquired, during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization Total debt at December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 was $4,218 million and $4,206 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. As of December 30, 2022, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, had $231 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.70%. TEGSA had $370 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.45% at September 30, 2022. 29
Table of Contents TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a maturity date of June 2026 and total commitments of $1.5 billion. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 30, 2022 or September 30, 2022. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of December 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper. TEGSA’s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $178 million and $163 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We repurchased approximately two million of our common shares for $233 million and approximately two million of our common shares for $246 million under the share repurchase program during the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 30, 2022, we had $1.4 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Summarized
Guarantor Financial Information As discussed above, our senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are issued by TEGSA and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA’s parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. In addition to being the issuer of our debt securities, TEGSA owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating subsidiaries.

The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2023 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At December 30, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $170 million, excluding those related to our former Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business which are discussed below. During fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale. These performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately $59 million as of December 30, 2022 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2027. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Trade Compliance Matters We have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations are ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved. 31
Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension plans are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management. For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. There were no significant changes to this information during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Non-GAAP Financial Measure Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) We present organic net sales growth (decline) as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. Organic net sales growth (decline) provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses this measure together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in “Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth (decline) to net sales growth (decline) calculated in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth (decline) in combination with net sales growth (decline) to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
