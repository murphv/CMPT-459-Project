F ormation and Description of Business
Formation
Woodbridge Liquidation Trust (the “Trust”) was established (i) for the purpose of collecting, administering, distributing and liquidating the Trust assets for the benefit of the Trust beneficiaries in
accordance with the Liquidation Trust Agreement of the Trust and the First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Liquidation of Woodbridge Group of Companies, LLC and its Affiliated Debtors dated August 22, 2018 (as amended, modified, supplemented or
restated from time to time, the (“Plan”)); (ii) to resolve disputed claims asserted against the Debtors; (iii) to litigate and/or settle causes of action (“Causes of Action”); and (iv) to pay certain allowed claims and statutory fees, as required
by the Plan. Woodbridge Group of Companies, LLC and its affiliated debtors are individually referred to herein as a Debtor and collectively as the Debtors. The Trust was formed on February 15, 2019 (the “Plan Effective Date”) as a statutory trust
under Delaware law.
On the Plan Effective Date, in accordance with the Plan, (a) the following assets automatically vested in the Trust: (i) an aggregate $ 5,000,000
in cash from the Debtors for the purpose of funding the Trust’s initial expenses of operation; (ii) certain claims and Causes of Action; (iii)
all of the outstanding equity interests of the Wind-Down Entity (as defined below); and (iv) certain other non-real estate related assets, (b) the equity interests of Woodbridge Group of Companies, LLC and Woodbridge Mortgage Investment Fund 1, LLC
(together, the “Remaining Debtors”) were cancelled and new equity interests representing all of the newly issued and outstanding equity interests in the Remaining Debtors were issued to the Trust, (c) all of the other Debtors other than the
Remaining Debtors were dissolved and (d) the real estate-related assets of the Debtors were automatically vested in the Trust’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Woodbridge Wind-Down Entity LLC (the “Wind-Down Entity”) or one of the Wind-Down Entity’s
43
wholly-owned single member LLCs (the “Wind-Down Subsidiaries”) formed to own the respective real estate assets. The Trust, the Remaining Debtors, the
Wind-Down Entity and the Wind-Down Subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company .”
As further discussed in Note 10, the Trust
has
two
classes of liquidation trust interests, Class A Liquidation Trust Interests (“Class A Interests”) and Class B Liquidation Trust
Interests (“Class B Interests”). The holders of Class A Interests and Class B Interests are collectively referred to as “All Interestholders .”
On December 24, 2019, the
Trust’s Registration Statement on Form 10 became effective under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The trading symbol for the Trust’s Class A Interests is WBQNL. Bid and asked prices for the Trust’s Class A Interests are
quoted on the OTC Link ATS, the SEC-registered alternative trading system. The Class A Interests are eligible for the Depository Trust Company’s Direct Registration System (DRS) services.   The Class B Interests
are not registered with the SEC.
Description of
Business
The Trust is
prosecuting various Causes of Action acquired by the Trust pursuant to the Plan and is resolving claims asserted against the Debtors. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is the plaintiff in several pending lawsuits. The Company has accrued an
estimate of the amount of legal costs to be incurred to pursue this litigation, excluding contingent fees. As more fully discussed in Note 2, the Company’s consolidated financial statements do not include any estimate of future net recoveries from
litigation and settlement, since the Company cannot reasonably estimate them.
The Wind-Down
Entities’ operations are almost complete.
As
of December 31, 2022, one of the Wind-Down Subsidiaries owned  one
single-family home, located in Los Angeles, California.
This single-family home is listed for sale. As of December
31,   2022,
the Wind-Down Subsidiaries also owned
two
secured loans and
two
other
properties located in other states
(see Note 3.)

Woodbridge Liquidation Trust and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
(Unaudited)
The Company is required to liquidate its assets and distribute available cash to the Trust beneficiaries. The liquidation activities are carried
out by the Trust, the Wind-Down Entity and the Wind-Down Subsidiaries. As of
December
31, 2022 , the Company estimates that the liquidation activities will be completed by February 15, 2024.
As more fully discussed in Note 2, the Company uses the Liquidation Basis of Accounting. The Trust currently operates as
one
reportable segment comprised primarily of real estate assets held for sale. Net assets in liquidation represent the remaining estimated aggregate
value available to Trust beneficiaries upon liquidation, with no discount for the timing of proceeds (undiscounted).  Net liquidation proceeds, other recoveries and actual liquidation costs may differ materially from the estimated amounts due to
the unpredictability of real estate selling prices, the impact of the COVID-19 virus and other global health crises (see below), as well as the uncertainty in the timing of liquidation of the real estate and other assets.
The Trust’s expectations about the amount of any additional distributions and when
they will be paid are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on certain estimates and assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect.  As a result, the actual amount of any additional distributions may differ materially,
perhaps in adverse ways, from the Trust estimates. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict the timing of any additional distributions and any such distributions may not be made within the timing referenced in the consolidated financial
statements.
No assurance can be given that total distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets in liquidation presented
in the consolidated statements of net assets in liquidation.
The Company observes
health and safety guidelines, including allowing its employees to work remotely. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 virus and other global health crises on its activities, including the time needed to market and sell
its remaining real estate assets and the price at which these real estate assets will be sold. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 virus and other global health crises will depend on many factors, some of which cannot be foreseen, including the
duration, severity, and geographic concentrations of the pandemic and any resurgence of the disease.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, the
consolidated financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results for such periods. These consolidated
financial statements have been presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 205-30, “Liquidation Basis of Accounting,” as amended by Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2013-07, “Presentation of Financial
Statements (Topic 205), Liquidation Basis of Accounting.” The June 30, 2022 consolidated statement of net assets in liquidation included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all disclosures or
notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Woodbridge Liquidation Trust and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
(Unaudited)
Use of Estimates
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and for the period then ended. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities are revised in the period that available information supports a change in the carrying amount.
Liquidation Basis of Accounting
Under the liquidation basis of accounting, all assets are recorded at their estimated net realizable value or liquidation value, which represents
the estimated amount of net cash that will be received upon the disposition of the assets (on an undiscounted basis). The measurement of real estate assets held for sale is based on current contracts (if any), estimates and other indications of
sales value, net of estimated selling costs. To determine the value of real estate assets held for sale, the Company considered the three traditional approaches to value (cost, income and sales comparison) commonly used by the real estate appraisal
community. The applicability and relevancy of each valuation approach as applied may differ by asset. In most cases, the sales comparison approach was accorded the greatest weight. This approach compares a property to other properties with similar
characteristics that have recently sold. To validate management’s estimate, the Company also considered opinions from qualified real estate professionals and local real estate brokers and, in some cases, obtained third party appraisals. The
estimated selling costs range from
5.0 % to
6.5 %
of the property sales price.
Liabilities, including estimated costs associated with implementing and completing the Plan, are measured in accordance with U.S. GAAP that
otherwise applies to those liabilities. The Company has also recorded the estimated development costs to be incurred to prepare the assets for sale as well as the estimated holding costs to be incurred until the projected sale date and the
estimated general and administrative costs to be incurred until the completion of the liquidation of the Company and estimated reserves for contingencies. When estimating development costs, the Company considered third party construction contracts
and estimates of costs to complete based on construction status, progress and projected completion timing. Estimated development costs also include the costs of design and furnishings necessary to prepare and stage the homes for marketing as well
as an accrual for warranty claims. Holding cost estimates consider property taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other costs to be incurred until the sale of the property is closed. Projected general and administrative cost estimates take
into account operating costs through the completion of the liquidation of the Company.
These estimated amounts are presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of net assets in liquidation.  All changes in the estimated
liquidation value of the Company’s real estate held for sale, or other assets and liabilities are reflected as a change to the Company’s net assets in liquidation.
The Company does not record any amount from the future settlement of unresolved
Causes of Action or recoveries of Fair Funds in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since they cannot be reasonably estimated. The amount recovered may be material to the Company’s net assets in liquidation.
On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the estimated net realizable values, liquidation costs and the estimated date of the completion of the
liquidation of the Company and records any significant changes. The Company will also revalue an asset when it is under contract for sale and the buyer’s contingencies have been removed. During the period when this occurs, the carrying value of the
asset and the estimated closing and other costs will be adjusted, if necessary. If the Company has a change in its plan for the disposition of an asset, the carrying value will be adjusted to reflect this change in the period that the change is
approved. The change in value may include the accrued liquidation costs related to the asset.

Other Assets
The Company recognizes recoveries from the settlement of unresolved Causes of Action when an agreement is executed and
collectability is reasonably assured. An allowance for uncollectible settlement installment receivables is recorded when there is doubt about the collectability of the receivable.  Insurance claims are recognized when the insurance company
accepts the claim or if a claim is pending and the recoverable amount can be estimated. The Company records escrow receivables at the amount that is expected to be received when the escrow receivable is released. The Forfeited Assets (Note 7)
received from the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), other than cash, have been recorded at their estimated net realizable value. In addition, the Company recognizes other amounts to be received based on contractual terms or when
the amounts to be received are certai n.
Accrued Liquidation Costs
The Company accrues for estimated liquidation costs to the extent they are reasonably determinable. These costs consist of (a) estimated
development costs of the single-family homes, including construction and other project related costs, architectural and engineering, project management, city fees, bond payments (net of refunds), furnishings, marketing, estimated reserves for
potential warranty claims and contingent liabilities and other costs; (b) estimated holding costs, including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities and other; and (c) estimated general and administrative costs including payroll, legal
and other professional fees, trustee and board fees, rent and other office related expenses, and other general and administrative costs to operate the Company.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers short-term investments that have a maturity date of ninety days or less at the time of investment to be a cash equivalent.
The Company’s cash equivalents include deposits with financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash includes cash that can only be used for certain specified purposes.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash. At times, balances in any one financial institution may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. The Company mitigates this risk by depositing its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in high-credit quality financial institutions.
In addition, the Company uses strategies to reduce deposit balances at any one financial institution consistent with FDIC insurance limits.
Income Taxes
The Trust is intended to be treated as a grantor trust for income tax purposes and, accordingly, is not subject to federal or state income tax on
any income earned or gain recognized by the Trust. The Trust’s beneficiaries will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each asset, including cash and each liability received by and held by the Trust. Each beneficiary will be required to
report on his or her federal and state income tax return his or her pro rata share of taxable income, including gains and losses recognized by the Trust. Accordingly, there is no provision for federal or state income taxes recorded in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The Company regularly analyzes its various federal and state filing positions and only recognizes the income tax effect in the consolidated
financial statements when certain criteria regarding uncertain income tax positions have been met. The Company believes that its income tax positions would more likely than not be sustained upon examination by all relevant taxing authorities.
Therefore, no provision for uncertain income tax positions has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

Forfeited Assets
-
Restricted for Qualifying Victims
The Trust entered into a resolution agreement with the DOJ which provided that the Trust would receive the assets
forfeited (“Forfeited Assets”) by Robert and Jeri Shapiro. The agreement provided for the release of specified Forfeited Assets by the DOJ to the Trust and for the Trust to liquidate those assets and distribute the net sale proceeds to Qualifying
Victims.  Qualifying Victims include the vast majority of Trust beneficiaries (specifically, all former holders of allowed Class 3 and 5 claims and their permitted assigns), but do not include former holders of Class 4 claims. Distributions to
Qualifying Victims are to be allocated pro-rata based on their net allowed claims without considering the (i)
5 % enhancement for
contributing their causes of action and (ii)
72.5 % Class 5 coefficient.

Distributions
The Plan provides for a distribution waterfall that specifies the priority and manner of distribution of available cash to all Interestholders,
excluding distributions of the net sales proceeds from Forfeited Assets (Note 7). Distributions are to be made (a) to the Class A Interests until they have received distributions of $ 75.00
per Class A Interest; thereafter (b) to the Class B Interests until they have received distributions of $ 75.00
per Class B Interest; thereafter (c) to each Liquidation Trust Interest (whether a Class A Interests or Class B Interest) until the aggregate of all distributions
made pursuant to this clause equals an amount equivalent to interest, at a per annum fixed rate of
10 %, compounded annually
Interests , accrued on the aggregate principal amount of all Net Note Claims, Allowed General Unsecured Claims and Net Unit Claims, all as defined in the Plan,
treating each distribution pursuant to (a) and (b) above as reductions of such principal amount; and thereafter (d) to the holders of Allowed Subordinated Claims, as defined in the Plan, until such claims are paid in full, including interest, at a
per annum fixed rate of
10 % or such higher rate as may be agreed to, as provided for in the Plan, compounded annually, accrued on the
principal amount of each Allowed Subordinated Claim, as defined.

The distribution was declared on June 15, 2022 and paid on July 15, 2022.
For every distribution, a deposit is made into a restricted cash account for
amounts (a) payable for Class A Interests that may be issued in the future upon the allowance of unresolved claims, (b) in respect of Class A Interests issued on account of recently allowed claims (c) for holders of Class A Interests who failed
to cash distribution checks mailed in respect of prior distributions (d) for distributions that were withheld due to pending avoidance actions and (e) for holders of Class A Interests for which the Trust is waiting for further beneficiary
information.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as (a) claims were
resolved, (b) claims were recently allowed, (c) addresses for holders of uncashed distribution checks were obtained, (d) pending avoidance actions were resolved and (e) further beneficiary information was received, distributions of
approximately $ 6 ,000 and $ 75 ,000,
respectively, and during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $ 657 ,000 and $ 113 ,000, respectively, were paid to holders of Class A Interests from the restricted cash account and distributions payable were reduced by the same
amount.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as a result of
claims being disallowed or Class A Interests being cancelled, approximately $ 0
and $ 191 ,000, respectively, and during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $ 2,638 ,000 and $ 289 ,000 were released from the restricted cash account and

As a result of distribution checks that had not been cashed within 180 days of
their issuance, Interestholders were deemed to have forfeited their rights to reserved and future Class A Interest distributions. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, some Interestholders that had previously been deemed to
have been forfeited their rights to receive Class A Interest distributions had responded and therefore approximately $ 0
and $ 12 ,000, respectively, was added to the restricted cash account and distributions payable were increased by the same amount. During the three and
six months ended December 31, 2021,
no
Interestholders were deemed to have forfeited their rights to reserved and future Class
A distributions.

provision, at the option of the Trust on an as-needed basis, of e-discovery and related litigation support services in connection with the Trust’s prosecution of the Causes of Action. Under the arrangement, the Trust is charged for the services
at scheduled rates per task which, depending on specific task, include flat rates, rates based on volume of data processed, rates based on the number of data users, the hourly rates of Akerman LLP personnel, or other rates. During the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, approximately
$ 79 ,000 and $ 107 ,000, respectively, and
during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, approximately
$ 194 ,000 and $ 214 ,000 were paid related to these services and
there are
no
outstanding
payables as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 .
The executive officers of the Wind-Down Entity are entitled to a bonus based on the Wind-Down Entity achieving certain specified cumulative amounts of distributions to the
Trust. Based on the carrying amounts of the net assets in liquidation included in the accompanying consolidated statements of net assets in liquidation, approximately $ 0
and
$ 3,000 ,000 were a ccrued
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, as
the
estimated amount of the bonus (including associated payroll taxes). This amount is included in the payroll and payroll-related costs portion of accrued liquidation costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of net assets in liquidation.

Commitments and Contingencies
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
construction contracts under which approximately $ 400 ,000 was unpaid.
The Company had a lease for its office space that expired on August 31, 2021.
On June 4, 2021, the Company entered into a new office lease at a different location. The new lease was for the period from
August 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022 and
had
two
six-month
options to extend the lease. On May 16, 2022, the Company extended its lease for
six months
and on November 16, 2022, the Company exercised its second option and extended its lease for an additional
six months . In addition, the Company amended its lease to include a
third
six-month
option to extend.
The monthly base rent is approximately $ 4 ,000 plus common area maintenance charges. The amount of rent paid, including common area maintenance and parking charges, during the
three
months ended December
31,   2022
and
2021,
was approximately
$ 13 ,000
and
$ 1 ,000,
respectively, and during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was approximately $ 25 ,000 and $ 51 ,000, respectively. The Company has
one
additional
six-month
option to extend the lease.
The Company has part-time employment
agreements with executive officers through December 31, 2023.
The Company is not presently the defendant in any mat erial litigation nor, to the Company’s knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company.
15)
Subsequent Events
The Company evaluates subsequent events up until the date the unaudited consolidated financial
statements are issued.
Distributions
As a result of
distribution checks that had not been cashed within 180 days of their issuance, Interestholders were deemed to have forfeited their rights to reserved and future Class A Interest distributions. During the period from January 1, 2023 through
February 10, 2023, an Interestholder that had previously been deemed to have been forfeited their rights to receive Class A Interest distributions had responded and therefore approximately $ 14 ,000 was added to the restricted cash account and distributions payable were increased by the same amount.
During the period from January 1, 2023 through February 10, 2023, as (a) claims were resolved, (b) claims were recently allowed, (c) addresses for holders of
uncashed distribution checks were obtained, (d) pending avoidance actions were resolved and (e) further beneficiary information was received, distributions of approximately $ 14 ,000 were paid to holders of Class A Interests from the restricted cash account and distributions payable were reduced by the same amount.

Sales/Settlement of Real Estate Assets
On January 30, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its last single-family home remaining in the Company’s real
asset portfolio. The closing of the sale is subject to a number of contingencies, including the satisfactory completion of the purchaser’s due diligence. No assurance can be given that all such contingencies will be satisfied or that the
closing of the sale will occur.  Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has any material relationship with the purchaser other than in respect of the transaction.
On January 3, 2023, the Company settled
one
secured loan for approximately $ 785 ,000.
Forfeited Assets
During the period from January 1, 2023 through February 10, 2023, the Company realized net proceeds of approximately $ 16 ,000 from the sale of Forfeited Assets.
On February 7, 2023, the Trust was informed that the DOJ had received additional Forfeited Assets from a co-defendant of Robert Shapiro and that the DOJ would like
to release these Forfeited Assets to the Trust. The Trust has not entered into an agreement with the DOJ for the release of these Forfeited Assets. It is expected that the proceeds from these Forfeited Assets would be distributed to Qualifying
Victims (see Note 7). The Trust is unable to estimate the amount and timing of the release of these Forfeited Assets, if any.
Other Refunds
During the period from January 1, 2023 through February 10, 2023, the Company received approximately $ 23 ,000 of property tax refunds.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of changes in net assets and net assets in liquidation and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Woodbridge Liquidation Trust and the related notes thereto. The Trust, the Remaining Debtors, the Wind-Down Entity and the Wind-Down Subsidiaries, as used herein, are defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements and are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Those statements include, without limitation, financial guidance, and
projections and statements with respect to expectation of future financial condition, changes in net assets in liquidation, cash flows, plans, targets, goals, objectives, performance, and termination and dissolution of the Trust. Such
forward-looking statements also include statements that are preceded by, followed by, or that include the words “believes”, “estimates”, “plans”, “expects”, “intends”, “is anticipated”, “will continue”, “project”, “may”, “could”, “would”, “should”
and similar expressions, and all other statements that are not historical facts. All such forward-looking statements are based on the Trust’s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ
materially from those set forth in such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include the amount of sales proceeds, timing of sales of real estate assets, amount of funds needed for warranty claims, punch list items and holding costs of
single-family homes, amount of general and administrative costs, the number and amount of successful litigations and/or settlements and the ability to recover thereon, the amount of funding required to continue litigations, the continuing impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health issues, interest rates, adverse weather conditions in the regions in which properties to be sold are located, inflation, domestic and global economic and political conditions, changes in tax and other
governmental rules and regulations applicable to the Trust and its subsidiaries and other risks and uncertainties identified in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, or contained in any of
the Trust’s subsequent filings with the SEC including in Part II. Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q. These risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Trust to control, and in many cases, the Trust cannot predict
the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.
In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act, the Trust has identified and is disclosing important factors, risks and
uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements made by the Trust, or on the Trust’s behalf. (See “Part II. Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-Q.)
These cautionary statements are to be used as a reference in connection with any forward-looking statements. The factors, risks and uncertainties identified in these cautionary statements are in addition to those contained in any other cautionary
statements, written or oral, which may be made or otherwise addressed in connection with a forward-looking statement or contained in any of the Trust’s subsequent filings with the SEC. Because of these factors, risks and uncertainties, the Trust
cautions against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Although the Trust believes that the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements are currently reasonable, any of the assumptions could be incorrect or incomplete, and
there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Except as may be required by law, the Trust does not undertake any obligations to
modify, update or revise any forward-looking statement to take into account or otherwise reflect subsequent events, corrections in or revisions of underlying assumptions, or changes in circumstances arising after the date that the forward-looking
statement was made.
Overview
Pursuant to the Plan, the Trust was formed on February 15, 2019 to hold, either directly or indirectly through the Wind-Down Entity and the Wind-Down Subsidiaries, the assets
and equity interests formerly owned by the Debtors. Each of the real properties formerly owned by the Debtors was transferred, on the effective date of the Plan to one of the Wind-Down Subsidiaries. The purpose of the Wind-Down Group is to develop
(as applicable), market, and sell those properties to generate cash. Assets formerly owned by the Debtors other than real estate assets and certain cash were transferred on the Plan Effective Date of the Trust. The purpose of the Trust is to
receive remittances of cash from the Wind-Down Entity, to resolve disputed claims, to prosecute the Causes of Action, to pay allowed administrative and priority claims, as defined in the Plan, and, subject to the payment of Trust expenses and the
retention of various reserves, to make distributions of cash to Interestholders in accordance with the Plan.

Table of Contents
PART I.   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
The Trust operates pursuant to the Plan and the Trust Agreement. The Trust was formed as a Delaware statutory trust and is administered by the Liquidation Trustee under the
supervision of its Supervisory Board. The Wind-Down Entity, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Trust, operates pursuant to the Plan and the Wind-Down Entity LLC Agreement. The Wind-Down Entity was formed as a Delaware limited liability company and is
administered by its Board of Managers. One member of the Board of Managers is also a member of the Supervisory Board of the Trust.
The Bankruptcy Court has retained certain jurisdictions regarding the Trust, the Liquidation Trustee, the Supervisory Board, the Wind-Down Entity, the Board of Managers, and
assets of the Trust and the Wind-Down Entity, including the determination of all disputes arising out of or related to administration of the Trust and the Wind-Down Entity and its subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2022, the number of Liquidation Trust Interests outstanding in each class is as follows:
Class of Interest
Number Outstanding
Class A Liquidation Trust Interets
11,514,190
Class B Liquidation Trust Interets
675,617
For each of the classes of Liquidation Trust Interests, the number of Liquidation Trust Interests outstanding will increase to the extent that the disputed claims become
allowed claims. In addition, the number of Liquidation Trust Interests outstanding will decrease to the extent that disputed claims are settled by cancelling previously issued Liquidation Trust Interests.
Since the Plan Effective Date through December 31, 2022, the Wind-Down Subsidiaries have disposed of approximately 145 properties for aggregate net sales proceeds of
approximately $552.30 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned five real estate assets (including one single-family home listed for sale and one other real estate asset under contract) with a gross carrying value of approximately $31.40
million. Given the significantly smaller inventory of remaining real estate assets when compared to the inventory as of the Plan Effective Date, the amount of net proceeds from the sale of real estate assets in the future is likely to be less than
the amount realized from the Plan Effective Date through December 31, 2022. The Company expects to complete the liquidation of its assets during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The Company’s only sources for meeting its capital requirements are its cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of its real estate assets, recoveries on Causes of
Action and proceeds from the sale of Forfeited Assets 1 . The Company’s primary uses of funds are and will continue to be for distributions, development costs
including warranty claims, holding costs and general and administrative costs, all of which the Company expects to be able to adequately fund over the next twelve months from its primary sources of capital.
1
The Trust is required to distribute the net sale proceeds from liquidating the Forfeited Assets to the Qualifying Victims.
Qualifying Victims are the former holders of Class 3 and Class 5 Claims and their permitted assigns. Former holders of Class 4 Claims are not Qualifying Victims. Because of the requirement to distribute the net sale proceeds of the Forfeited
Assets to the Qualifying Victims only, the Forfeited Assets as of December 31, 2022 are presented in the consolidated statement of net assets as restricted net assets in liquidation. As of December 31, 2022, 11,436,259 of the 11,514,190 Class A
Interests were held by Qualifying Victims. Of the 13,875 Class A Interests relating to unresolved claims as of December 31, 2022, 1,880 would be held by Qualifying Victims.

Capital Resources
In addition to consolidated cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 of approximately $32.18 million (of which approximately $4.32 million is restricted), the
capital resources available to the Company are as follows:
•
Sales of Real Estate :  The Wind-Down Group is in the process of marketing and selling its real estate assets, all of which are held for sale.  One single-family home is listed for sale and one other real
estate asset was under contract as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned a total of five real estate assets with a gross carrying value of approximately $31.40 million. The majority of the gross carrying value
is concentrated in one single-family home. Based on the remaining assets of the Company, future net proceeds will be significantly less than the Company has realized in prior periods.
•
Causes of Action Recoveries :  During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized approximately $0.04 million and $0.23 million, respectively, from the settlement of Causes of
Action. There can be no assurance that the amounts the Company recovers from settling Causes of Action in the future will be consistent with the amount recovered in prior periods.
•
Forfeited Assets:   Forfeited Assets consist of cash and other assets (jewelry, art, clothing, handbags and shoes). During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Trust sold some of its
Forfeited Assets and received net proceeds of approximately $0.14 million and $0.71 million, respectively. As noted earlier, net sale proceeds from liquidating the Forfeited Assets are to be distributed only to Qualifying Victims.
Uses of Liquidity
The primary uses of the Company’s liquidity are to pay (a) distributions payable, (b) development costs including warranty claims, (c) holding costs including maintenance and
repair costs, and (d) general and administrative costs. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total liabilities were approximately $23.63 million. The total liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2022 may not be indicative of the costs paid in
future periods, which may vary materially from the current estimate.
Given current cash and cash equivalent balances, projected sales of real estate assets, estimated Causes of Action recoveries, distributions declared, and expected cash
needs, the Company does not expect a deficiency in liquidity in the next twelve months. Due to the uncertain nature of future net sales proceeds, recoveries and costs to be incurred, it is not possible to be certain that the current liquidity
will be adequate to cover all future financial needs of the Company.  Creating contingent obligation agreements and/or seeking methods to reduce professional costs, including legal fees, and administrative costs are strategies that could be
undertaken to address liquidity issues should they arise. These strategies could impact the Company’s ability to maximize recoveries from the settlement of unresolved Causes of Action.
Distributions
Distributions will be made at the sole discretion of the Liquidation Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the Trust Agreement. As of February 10, 2023,
the Liquidation Trustee has declared ten distributions to the Class A Interestholders. The distributions include a cash distribution on account of the then-allowed claims and a deposit is made into a restricted cash account for amounts that are
or may become payable (a) in respect of Class A Interests that may be issued in the future upon the allowance of unresolved bankruptcy claims, (b) in respect of Class A Interests on account of recently allowed claims, (c) for holders of Class A
Interests who failed to cash distribution checks mailed in respect of prior distributions, (d)  for distributions that were withheld due to pending avoidance actions and (e) for holders of Class A Interests for which the Trust is waiting for
further beneficiary information.
As claims are resolved, additional Class A Interests may be issued or cancelled (see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on September 26, 2022, “Part 1, Item 1.
Business, D. Plan Provisions Regarding the Company, 2. Treatment under the Plan of holders of claims against and equity interests in the Debtors and 3. Assets and liabilities of the Company”). Therefore, the total amount of a distribution
declared may change between the date declared and the date paid. The Liquidation Trustee will continue to assess the adequacy of funds held and expects to make additional cash distribution(s) on account of Class A Interests, but does not
currently know the timing or amount of any such distribution(s).

Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
Sections 7.6 and 7.18 of the Plan provide that distributions that have not been cashed within 180 calendar days of their issuance shall be null and void and the holder of the
associated Liquidation Trust Interests “shall be deemed to have forfeited its rights to any reserved and future Distributions under the Plan,” with such amounts to become “Available Cash” of the Trust for all purposes.  On February 1, 2022, the
Trust sent letters to the holders of the Class A Interests who had failed to cash distribution checks in respect of prior distributions, which checks were issued more than 180 days prior to the date of the letter. The letter informed each
recipient that, unless the Trust was contacted on or before February 28, 2022, such recipient’s reserved and future distributions would be deemed forfeited in accordance with the Plan  The Trust provided this final notice simply as a one-time
courtesy and reserves its rights to strictly enforce the Plan’s forfeiture provisions, and any other provision of the Plan, against any person (including any recipient of the final notice) at any time in the future, without further notice.
The following tables summarize the distributions declared, distributions paid and the activity in the restricted cash account for the periods from February 15, 2019
(inception) through December 31, 2022 and from February 15, 2019 (inception) through February 10, 2023:

PART I.   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
Management believes that, since its inception, the Wind-Down Entity has made substantial progress toward completion of its liquidation activities and is
nearing the end of the liquidation of its real estate portfolio. Holders of Liquidation Trust Interests are advised that future distributions from the Trust will be limited. Once the Company’s remaining real estate assets have been liquidated and
the net proceeds resulting therefrom, net of reserves, have been distributed, further distribution(s) will be materially reliant on future recoveries from litigation, which are uncertain and the amount (if any) and timing of which are difficult
to determine.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has contractual commitments related to construction contracts totaling approximately $0.40 million. The Company has an office lease that
expires in July 2023. The Company has one six-month option to extend the lease. The Company expects that it will continue to lease office space until the liquidation process is completed. The Company has part-time employment agreements with its
executive officers through December 31, 2023.
Critical Accounting Policies and Practices
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The accounting policies and practices that the Company believes are the most
critical are discussed below. These accounting policies and practices require management to make decisions on subjective and/or complex matters that may inherently be uncertain. Estimates are required to prepare the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are required in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, the sales price of real estate assets, selling costs, development costs, holding costs,
potential warranty claims, and general and administrative costs to be incurred until the completion of the liquidation of the Company and estimated reserves for contingent liabilities. In many instances, changes in the accounting estimates are
likely to occur from period to period. Actual results may differ from the estimates. The Company believes the current assumptions and other considerations used in preparing the consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual
experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net assets in
liquidation.
Liquidation Basis of Accounting
Under the Liquidation Basis of Accounting, all assets are recorded at their estimated net realizable value or liquidation value, which represents the estimated amount of net
cash that may be received upon the disposition of the assets (on an undiscounted basis). Liabilities are measured in accordance with U.S. GAAP that otherwise applies to those liabilities. The Company has not recorded any amount from the future
settlement of unresolved Causes of Action or recoveries of Fair Funds in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because they cannot be reasonably estimated.
Valuation of Real Estate
The measurement of real estate assets held for sale is based on current contracts (if any), estimates and other indications of sales value, net of estimated selling costs. To
determine the value of real estate assets held for sale, the Company considered the three traditional approaches to value (cost, income and sales comparison) commonly used by the real estate appraisal community. The applicability and relevancy of
each valuation approach as applied may differ by asset. In most cases, the sales comparison approach was accorded the greatest weight. This approach compares a property to other properties with similar characteristics that have recently sold. To
validate management’s estimate, the Company also considers opinions from qualified real estate professionals and local real estate brokers and, in some cases, has obtained third party appraisals.
Accrued Liquidation Costs
The estimated costs associated with implementing and completing the Company’s plan of liquidation are recorded as accrued liquidation costs. The Company has also recorded the
estimated development costs to be incurred to prepare the assets for sale as well as the estimated holding, maintenance and repair costs to be incurred until the projected sale date and the estimated general and administrative costs to be
incurred until the completion of the liquidation of the Company and estimated reserves for contingent liabilities.
32
Table of Contents
PART I.   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
Changes in Carrying Value
On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the estimated net realizable values, liquidation costs and the estimated date of the completion of the liquidation of the Company
and records any significant changes. The Company will also evaluate an asset when it is under contract for sale and the buyer’s contingencies have been removed. During the period that this occurs, the carrying value of the asset and the estimated
closing and other costs will be adjusted, if necessary. If the Company has a change in its plan for the disposition of an asset, the carrying value will be adjusted to reflect this change in the period that the change is approved. The change in
value may also include a change to the accrued liquidation costs related to the asset.
All changes in the estimated liquidation value of the Company’s assets, real estate held for sale, or other assets and liabilities are reflected as a change to the Company’s
net assets in liquidation.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, management and the Liquidation Trustee evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures. Based upon, and as of the date of, the evaluation, management and the Liquidation Trustee concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Liquidation Trustee, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
In connection with the preparation of our Form 10-Q, our management and the Liquidation Trustee assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022. In making that assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
(2013).
Based on its assessment, our management and the Liquidation Trustee believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based
on those criteria. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Legal Proceedings
Below are descriptions of pending litigation. As the Company is the plaintiff in these legal proceedings and does not have the ability to estimate the ultimate recovery amount until they are
settled, and in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, no recoveries have been recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for these legal proceedings, other than for settlements for which the Trust has entered into a
signed settlement agreement and collectability is reasonably assured.
Goldberg v. Halloran & Sage LLP, et al ., Case No. 19STCV42900 (Cal. Super. Ct., L.A. Cnty., filed Dec. 2, 2019), is an action by the Trust against nine
law firms (Halloran & Sage LLP; Balcomb & Green, P.C.; Rome McGuigan, P.C.; Haight Brown & Bonesteel LLP; Bailey Cavalieri LLC; Sidley Austin LLP; Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP; Robinson & Cole LLP; and Finn Dixon & Herling
LLP) and ten individual attorneys (Richard Roberts, Lawrence R. Green, Jon H. Freis, Brian Courtney, Ted Handel, Thomas Geyer, Neal Sullivan, S. Lee Terry, Jr., Shant Chalian, and Reed Balmer) for conduct in connection with their representation

The case was designated as a complex matter on December 18, 2019 and was assigned to the Honorable Amy Hogue.
On March 20, 2020, two sets of defendants – Sidley Austin LLP and Neal Sullivan; and Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP and S. Lee Terry, Jr. – filed special motions to strike the portions of the
complaint directed at them under a California statute (Civil Procedure Code section 425.16) that permits defendants to bring early challenges to causes of action against them that allegedly arise from protected litigation activity if those causes
of action lack minimal merit.  The defendants that filed these special motions to strike asserted that the claims against them arise from communicative conduct in the course of quasi-judicial proceedings, such as regulatory inquiries, and that
the Trust cannot establish a likelihood of prevailing on its claims against them.  The Trust opposed these motions, and the matters were heard on July 28, 2020, and taken under submission on that date.  On August 14, 2020, the Court entered
orders: (i) granting the motion to strike filed by Sidley Austin LLP and Neal Sullivan, and (ii) granting in part and denying in part the motion to strike filed by Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP and S. Lee Terry, Jr.  In September 2020, the Trust
filed notices of appeal of the foregoing orders, and Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP and S. Lee Terry, Jr. subsequently filed a cross-appeal.  On January 27, 2021, the Court entered an order granting, in part, a motion for attorneys’ fees filed by
Sidley Austin LLP and Neal Sullivan, pursuant to which the movants were awarded $282,500.00 in fees and $5,557.87 in costs. On March 1, 2021, the Trustee filed a notice of appeal of the order granting fees and costs.

On April 13, 2020, four sets of defendants – Rome McGuigan, P.C. and Brian Courtney; Bailey Cavalieri LLC and Thomas Geyer; Robinson & Cole LLP and Shant Chalian; and Finn Dixon &
Herling LLP and Reed Balmer – filed motions to quash the service of summonses.  The defendants that filed these motions asserted that they are not subject to suit in California because they do not have sufficient contacts with California to
justify a California court’s exercise of jurisdiction over them.  The Trust opposed these motions, and the matters were heard in part on July 15, 2020 and in part on July 20, 2020, and (with exception of the motion filed by Finn Dixon &
Herling LLP and Reed Balmer) were taken under submission on July 20, 2020.  The motion filed by Finn Dixon & Herling LLP, and Reed Balmer was taken off calendar prior to July 20, 2020, and the parties thereafter reached a confidential
settlement.  On July 21, 2020, the Court entered orders granting the motions to quash filed by Rome McGuigan, P.C. and Brian Courtney; Bailey Cavalieri LLC and Thomas Geyer; and Robinson & Cole LLP and Shant Chalian.  On September 10, 2020,
the Trust filed a notice of appeal of the foregoing orders.
On June 16, 2020, the Trust reached a confidential settlement with Balcomb & Green, P.C. and Lawrence R. Green.  On July 6, 2020, these defendants filed a motion seeking the Court’s
determination that the settlement was made in good faith under a California statute (Civil Procedure Code section 877.6) that permits settling defendants to seek a good faith settlement finding in order to bar any other defendant from seeking
contribution or indemnity.  The motion was unopposed, and the Court entered an order granting it on August 12, 2020.
On January 21, 2021, the Trust reached a confidential settlement with Robinson & Cole LLP and Shant Chalian.  As part of that settlement, the appeal of the jurisdictional ruling as to those
parties has been dismissed.
The other appeals remain pending. On June 14, 2021, the Trustee filed a combined opening brief for all of the appeals other than his appeal of the order granting fees and costs to Sidley Austin
LLP. Between September 22-29, 2021, the respondents filed their opening briefs.   On March 17, 2022, the Trustee filed a combined reply brief for all of the appeals other than his appeal of the order granting fees and costs to Sidley Austin LLP.
On June 30, 2022, Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP filed its reply brief in support of its cross-appeal of the order denying a portion of its special motion to strike.  The matter is currently fully briefed and the court has scheduled oral argument
commencing on March 7, 2023.
The appeal of the award granting fees and costs to Sidley Austin LLP remains pending. The appeal is fully briefed and will be decided following the disposition of the appeal of the underlying
order.
On October 28, 2020, the Trust filed a federal lawsuit against four defendants that prevailed on the motions to quash service of summons in the California state court action (Rome McGuigan,
P.C.; Brian Courtney; Bailey Cavalieri LLC; and Thomas Geyer), as well as a fifth defendant (Ivan Acevedo), and certain “Doe” defendants.”  The case is styled Goldberg v. Rome McGuigan, P.C., et al., Case No. 2:20-cv-09958-JFW-SK (C.D. Cal.).
The complaint contains counts for (i) violations of section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; (i) aiding and abetting fraud; (iii) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; (iv) negligent misrepresentation; (v) professional
negligence; (vi) aiding and abetting conversion; (vii) actual fraudulent transfer; and (viii) constructive fraudulent transfer.  The conduct challenged in the complaint includes certain of the same conduct challenged in the California state court
action, and a footnote in the complaint explains:  “Plaintiff filed an action in Los Angeles Superior Court against [four of these defendants] raising some of the claims asserted in this action.  Those defendants filed a motion to quash service,
alleging that the court did not have personal jurisdiction.  The Court granted those motions, and Plaintiff appealed.  Plaintiff brings this action to preserve his rights and ensure that his claims against [the defendants] are adjudicated on the
merits.  Should the state court appeal be successful, resulting in two cases being simultaneously litigated on the merits in two forums, [plaintiff] will consider dismissing this action and litigating the case in state court.”  On January 4,
2021, the four defendants from the California state court action filed motions to dismiss this federal lawsuit, and on March 4, 2021, the court entered an order granting those motions in part by dismissing the first count (arising under the
federal securities laws), without ruling on the remaining counts (arising under state law) in light of potential personal jurisdiction issues.  On March 29, 2021, the same four defendants again moved to dismiss the remaining counts for lack of
personal jurisdiction. On April 23, 2021 the federal court entered an order granting those motions, but has not yet entered a final judgment.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION (Continued)
Avoidance actions . The Trust is currently prosecuting numerous legal actions to recover preferential payments, fraudulent transfers, and other funds subject
to recovery by the bankruptcy estate.  These actions were filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “ Bankruptcy Court ”), are pending before the Honorable J. Kate Stickles, and generally fall into the
following categories:
•
Preferential transfers . Certain of the actions include claims arising under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code and seek to avoid or recover payments made by the Debtors
during the 90 days prior to the December 4, 2017 bankruptcy filing, including payments to miscellaneous vendors and former Noteholders and Unitholders.
•
Fraudulent transfers (Interest to Noteholders and Unitholders) . Certain of the actions include claims arising under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code and seek to avoid or
recover payments made by the Debtors during the course of the Ponzi scheme (from July 2012 through the December 4, 2017 bankruptcy filing) for interest paid to former Noteholders and Unitholders.
•
Fraudulent transfers (Shapiro personal expenses) . Certain of the actions include claims arising under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code and seek to avoid and recover
payments made by the Debtors during the course of the Ponzi scheme (from July 2012 through the December 4, 2017 bankruptcy filing) for the personal expenses of Robert and Jeri Shapiro, including those identified in a forensic report
prepared in connection with an SEC enforcement action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
•
Fraudulent transfers and fraud (against former agents) . These actions, which arise under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code and applicable state law governing fraudulent
transfers, seek to avoid and recover payments made by the Debtors during the course of the Ponzi scheme (from July 2012 through the December 4, 2017 bankruptcy filing) for commissions to former agents, as well as for fraud, aiding and
abetting fraud, and the unlicensed sale of securities asserted by the Trust based on claims contributed to the Trust by defrauded investors. These actions were filed by the Trust in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware between November 15, 2019 and December 4, 2019. Actions of this type are also being pursued by the SEC, and it is the Trust’s understanding that any recoveries obtained by the SEC will be transmitted to the Trust pursuant to Fair
Funds established by the SEC.
•
Fraudulent transfers (Kenneth Halbert).   The Trust is pursuing fraudulent transfer claims against Kenneth Halbert to avoid and recover prepetition payments of
principal and interest to Mr. Halbert. The Trust filed its initial complaint on December 1, 2019 and the operative first amended complaint on December 7, 2021. Fact discovery is currently underway, to be followed by expert discovery. The
court has not yet set a trial date.
The Trust has filed over 400 legal actions of this nature, many of which have been resolved, resulting in recoveries by or judgments in favor of the Trust. Since inception and as of January 31,
2023, the Trust has obtained judgments of approximately $44.73 million, including default judgments of approximately $36.21 million and stipulated judgments of approximately $8.52 million. It is unknown at this time how much, if any, will
ultimately be collected on the judgments.  Additionally, the Trust has entered into settlements in approximately 227 legal actions and approximately 245 potential avoidance claims for which litigation was not filed, resulting in aggregate
settlements of approximately $18.18 million of cash payments made or due to the Trust and approximately $11.21 million in reductions of claims against the Trust. As of January 31, 2023, 47 legal actions remain pending.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION (Continued)
Other legal proceedings.
In addition, other legal proceedings were prosecuted by the Trust and United States governmental authorities, which actions
resulted in recoveries in favor of the Trust. Such actions include:
•
Actions regarding the Shapiro’s personal assets.
On December 4, 2019, the Trust filed an action in the Bankruptcy Court, Adv. Pro. No. 10-51076 (BLS),
Woodbridge Liquidation Trust v. Robert Shapiro, Jeri Shapiro, 3X a Charm, LLC, Carbondale Basalt Owners, LLC, Davana Sherman Oaks Owners, LLC, In Trend Staging, LLC, Midland Loop Enterprises, LLC, Schwartz
Media Buying Company, LLC and Stover Real Estate Partners LLC . In this action, the Trust asserts claims under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code and applicable state law for avoidance of preferential and fraudulent transfers
together with claims for fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, the unlicensed sale of securities, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. The Trust seeks to recover damages and assets held in the names of Robert Shapiro, Jeri Shapiro
and their family members and entities owned or controlled by them, which assets the Trust contends are beneficially owned by the Debtors or for which the Debtors are entitled to recover based on the Shapiros’ defalcations, including over
$20 million in avoidable transfers. On February 4, 2022, the Trust entered into a Settlement Agreement with Ms. Jeri Shapiro resolving the Trust’s adversary proceeding against Ms. Shapiro.  In connection with the Settlement Agreement, Ms.
Shapiro responded to interrogatories from the Trust and submitted a declaration under penalty of perjury detailing her lack of assets.  Upon execution of the Settlement Agreement, Ms. Shapiro executed and delivered a Stipulated Judgment
for approximately $20.6 million that will be held by the Trust in escrow for three years that can be entered without notice if the Trust learns Ms. Shapiro’s representations in her declaration were false or materially inaccurate.
Additionally, Ms. Shapiro authorized the Trust to expunge the filed claims of certain co-defendants she was listed as an officer and turned over payments to the Trust that were received by certain co-defendants in the adversary
proceeding.  A stipulation of dismissal (as to Ms. Shapiro only) was entered on April 1, 2022.
•
Criminal proceeding and forfeiture.
In connection with the United States’ criminal case against Robert Shapiro (Case No. No. 19-20178-CR-ALTONAGA (S.D. Fla. 2019)),
Shapiro agreed to the forfeiture of certain assets.  The Trust filed a petition in the Florida court to claim the Forfeited Assets as property of the Debtors’ estates, and therefore as property that had vested in the Trust pursuant to the
Plan.  The Trust has entered into an agreement with the United States Department of Justice to resolve its claim.  The agreement was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on September 17, 2020 and was approved by the United States District
Court on October 1, 2020.  Among other things, the agreement provides for the release of specified Forfeited Assets by the United States to the Trust, and for the Trust to liquidate those assets and distribute the net sale proceeds to
Qualifying Victims, which include the vast majority of Trust beneficiaries—specifically, all former holders of Class 3 and 5 claims under the Plan and their permitted assigns—but do not include former holders of Class 4 claims under the
Plan. The Trust has taken possession of the Forfeited Assets and has sold the wine and gold assets as well as an automobile.  Some of the jewelry, art, clothing, handbags and shoes have also been sold.
Wind-Down Group litigation . The Wind-Down Group owns a portfolio of real estate assets, which includes secured loans and other properties.  As part of its
recovery efforts, the Wind-Down Group, through its subsidiaries, is involved in ordinary routine litigation incidental to such assets.  Among other litigation, certain Woodbridge entities (including the Trust, the Wind-Down Entity, and WB 8607
Honoapiilani, LLC) filed an action against Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that the defendant insurer breached its obligations under an insurance policy purchased to protect a property owned by WB
8607 Honoapiilani (a subsidiary of the Wind-Down Entity) in Hawaii, which property was destroyed by fire in August 2017.  The Superior Court granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment, and on March 25, 2021 entered judgment in favor of
the defendant.  The judgment provided that plaintiffs take nothing by way of the complaint.  Further, the judgment provided that defendant refund plaintiffs for the premium payments under the insurance policy at issue in the lawsuit
($110,829.43), less all amounts paid by the defendant in respect of claims under the policy ($97,770.38) and less defendant’s costs (defendant requested costs of $9,874.71).  Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment. The appeal was fully briefed and
oral argument took place before the Court of Appeal on November 21, 2022.  The Court of Appeal has taken the matter under submission and a ruling is expected shortly.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors
Not applicable, as the Company is a “smaller reporting company” within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
In accordance with the Plan, all Liquidation Trust Interests have been issued without registration under the Securities Act.  The Liquidation Trust Interests have been issued only to holders of
allowed claims in Class 3, Class 4, and Class 5 under the Plan entirely in exchange for such claims.  See “Item 1.  Business - D. Plan Provisions Regarding the Company
-
2. Treatment under the Plan of
holders of claims against and equity interests in the Debtors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 26, 2022.  During the period from February 15, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2022, the Trust has issued an
aggregate of 11,542,087 Class A Interests and an aggregate of 677,790 Class B Interests.  As of December 31, 2022, the Trust had 11,514,190 Class A Interests and 675,617 Class B Interests outstanding. All Liquidation Trust Interests were issued
on the Plan Effective Date or from time to time thereafter as soon as practicable as and when claims in Class 3, Class 4 or Class 5 have become allowed.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Trust did not issue any Liquidation Trust Interests.
The issuance of Liquidation Trust Interests has occurred in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy
Code. Section 1145(a)(1) exempts the offer and sale of securities under a plan of reorganization from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws and regulation if (i) the securities are offered and sold under a plan of
reorganization and are securities of the debtor, of an affiliate of the debtor participating in a joint plan with the debtor, or of a successor to the debtor under the plan; (ii) the recipients of the securities hold a pre-petition or
administrative claim against the debtor or an interest in the debtor; and (iii) the securities are issued entirely in exchange for the recipient’s claim against or interest in the debtor, or principally in such exchange and partly for cash or
property. The Trust believes that the Liquidation Trust Interests are securities of a “successor” to the Debtors within the meaning of Section 1145(a)(1), and such securities were issued under the Plan entirely in exchange for allowed claims in
Class 3, Class 4, and Class 5 under the Plan.

Defaults upon Senior Securities
