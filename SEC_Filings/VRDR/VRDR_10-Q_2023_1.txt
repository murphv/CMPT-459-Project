All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding the Company’s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, events or developments which the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof); expansion and growth of the Company’s business and operations; and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results or developments will conform with the Company’s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, market and business conditions; the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by the Company; changes in laws or regulation; and other factors, most of which are beyond the control of the Company.   These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “estimates,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” or similar terms. These statements appear in a number of places in this filing and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, and its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting the Company’s financial condition or results of operations for its limited history; (ii) the Company’s business and growth strategies; and, (iii) the Company’s financing plans. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors that could adversely affect actual results and performance include, but are not limited to, the Company’s limited operating history, potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results and expenses, government regulation, technological change and competition. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to our filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including our Current Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2022.   Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The Company assumes no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.     3 Table of Contents   PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION   Item 1.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.     F-5 Table of contents   In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 which has been derived from audited financial statements and these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to state fairly the results for the periods presented. The results for the period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 or for any future period.   These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management’s Discussion and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on November 4, 2022.   · Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.   In preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.   · Basis of Consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Verde Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation. The Company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with guidance found in ASC 805, Business Combinations. The guidance requires consideration given, including contingent consideration, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed to be valued at their fair market values at the acquisition date.   · Segment Reporting
Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 280,
Segment Reporting
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Company’s internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Company operates in four reportable operating segments.   · Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company’s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.   · Risks and Uncertainties
The Company operates in the resource exploration industry that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource exploration business, including the potential risk of business failure.   · Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company had $ 363,560
and $ 418,917
in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.   At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits and petty cash on hands.   · Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at net realizable value. An allowance for doubtful accounts will be recorded in the period when a loss is probable based on an assessment of specific evidence indicating troubled collection, historical experience, accounts aging, ongoing business relation and other factors. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection. If accounts receivable are to be provided for, or written off, they would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within operating expenses. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company has no allowance for doubtful accounts, as per management’s judgment based on their best knowledge. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the longest credit term for certain customers are
60
days.     F-6 Table of contents   · Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value (net realizable value), cost being determined on a first-in-first-out method. Costs include material, labor and overhead costs. The Company provides inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand.   As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company did not record an allowance for obsolete inventories, nor have there been any write-offs.   · Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after taking into account their estimated residual values:       Expected useful life   Land and buildings   3 - 27.5
years   Plant and machinery   5 - 7
years   Office equipment   3
years   Project equipment   5
years   Computer   5
years   Motor vehicle   5
years   Furniture & fittings   5
years     Expenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterment which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income in other income or expenses.   · Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired from third parties are measured initially at fair value, with finite lives of 10 years, which are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually. These intangible assets are to be amortized over these estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, upon the success of its commercial operation.   · Impairment of Long-lived Assets
In accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360,
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , all long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets owned and held by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.   · Revenue Recognition
ASC Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC Topic 606”), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers.
The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:   · identify the contract with a customer; · identify the performance obligations in the contract; · determine the transaction price; · allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and · recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.     F-7 Table of contents   Revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contract by transferring the promised product to its customer that obtains control of the product and collection is reasonably assured. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer. Most of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer products or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, not distinct.   Product sales   Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.   Revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the Company’s customers.   Product revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, returns and rebates. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable as the amount is payable to the Company’s customer.   Gold mining   Revenue from the sales of gold mineral or other minerals to registered gold trading companies or other customers in Malaysia is recognized as revenue in accordance with the following core principles: at the time of gold or minerals sales, the contract with customers and the performance obligations are identified. The transaction and selling price is determined by the prevailing market value of gold bullion quoted by the leading registered gold trading company in Malaysia or at an agreed price. Sales invoice will be prepared to reflect the proper transaction price based on the performance obligation allocation. After delivery is completed and the performance obligation is satisfied, sales invoice will be presented to the customers and so revenue is then recognized accordingly.   · Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for the operating lease, the Company generally uses an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU assets”) assets represent the Company’s right to control the use of an identified asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are generally recognized based on the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   ROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC Topic 360,
Property, Plant, and Equipment , as ROU assets are long-lived nonfinancial assets.   ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.   The Company recognized no impairment of ROU assets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.   The operating lease is included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as current and non-current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.   Leases that transfer substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership to the lessee, other than legal title, are accounted for as finance leases. Substantially all of the risks or benefits of ownership are deemed to have been transferred if any one of the four criteria is met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease containing a bargain purchase option, (iii) the lease term exceeding 75% of the estimated economic life of the leased asset, (iv) the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeding 90% of the fair value. At the inception of a finance lease, we as the lessee records an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. The leased asset is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life if title does not transfer to us, while the leased asset is depreciated in accordance with our depreciation policy if the title is to eventually transfer to us. The periodic rent payments made during the lease term are allocated between a reduction in the obligation and interest element using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 842.   · Income Taxes
The Company adopted the ASC Topic 740,
Income tax
provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.     F-8 Table of contents   The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.   Uncertain Tax Positions   The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the ASC Topic 740 provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   · Foreign Currencies Translation   The Company’s reporting currency is the United States dollar (“US$”) and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been expressed in United States dollars. In addition, some of the Company’s subsidiaries operating in Malaysia maintain their books and records in the local currency, Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR”) which is their functional currency, being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted.  In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “ Translation of Financial Statement ”, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Shareholders’ equity is translated using the historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statements of changes in stockholder’s equity.   Translation of MYR into U.S. dollars has been made at the following exchange rates for the following periods:-       December 31, 2022     December 30, 2021   Period-end MYR:US$ exchange rate     0.22715       0.24004   Average period MYR:US$ exchange rate     0.22102       0.23931     · Comprehensive Income
ASC Topic 220,
Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.   · Net Loss per Share
The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,
Earnings per Share . Basic income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.   · Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10,
Compensation-Stock Compensation , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are based on estimated fair values. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period.   The Company accounts for non-employee stock-based awards at fair value in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC Topic 505-50, “ Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees ”.   · Mineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs
Mineral property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserves.     F-9 Table of contents   · Environmental Expenditures
The operations of the Company have been,and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The Company’s policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically proven and economically feasible measures.   Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. All of these types of expenditures incurred since inception have been charged against earnings due to the uncertainty of their future recoverability. Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation, net of expected recoveries.   · Related Parties
The Company follows the ASC 850-10,
Related Party
for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.   Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.   The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.   · Commitments and Contingencies
The Company follows the ASC 450-20,
Commitments
to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.   If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.   Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.     F-10 Table of contents   · Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below:   Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.     Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.     Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.   The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.   The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepayments and other receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other payables, loans payable, and amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.   · Recent Accounting Pronouncements
During the period ended December 31, 2022, there have been no new, or existing, recently issued accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance, that impact the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.   NOTE 3 -
GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.   The Company has generated recurring losses and suffered from an accumulated deficit of $ 9,810,142
at December 31, 2022. The continuation of the Company as a going concern in the next twelve months is dependent upon the Company pursuing additional financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.   The ability of the Company to survive is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan.  In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings, and related party loans.   No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.   These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.   NOTE 4 –

This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified fixed asset explicitly or implicitly for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed if we obtain the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the underlying asset. Some of our leases include both lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component as the Company has elected the practical expedient. Some of the operating lease agreements include variable lease costs, primarily taxes, insurance, common area maintenance or increases in rental costs related to inflation. Substantially all of our equipment leases and some of our real estate leases have terms of less than one year and, as such, are accounted for as short-term leases as we have elected the practical expedient.   Operating leases are included in the right-of-use lease assets, and current and non-current lease liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at each lease’s commencement date based on the present values of its lease payments over its respective lease term. When a borrowing rate is not explicitly available for a lease, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on information available at the lease’s commencement date to determine the present value of its lease payments. Operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   The Company adopts a
5 % as weighted average incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The weighted average remaining life of the lease was
3
years.   The table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.       December 31, 2022     June 30, 2022                 Assets             Right-of-use asset (#1)   $ 634,286     $ 685,714   Right-of-use asset (#2)     59,310       -         693,596       685,714                     Liabilities                 Current:                 Operating lease liabilities   $ 18,975     $ -   Finance lease liabilities   $ 169,496     $ 75,224                     Non-current:                 Operating lease liabilities   $ 40,335     $ -   Finance lease liabilities     686,883       97,900                     Total lease liabilities   $ 915,689     $ 173,124     As of December 31, 2022, right-of-use assets were $ 693,596

The leasing premium has been paid but the mining lease certificate will only be issued upon clearance from the Malaysia Forest Department, which is expected in mid 2023 subject to review on COVID-19 “Movement Control Order” by the Malaysian government.   For the current Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine, our mining operation would focus on mining other resources such as limestones.   As our business is affected by the fluctuations of gold prices, the Company intends to diversify its product line by acquiring mining projects with potential for different mineral resources other than gold. We continue to hold discussions with other mining companies for potential collaboration to carry out exploration and exploitation works on other mineral resources in Southeast Asia regions.

)   $ (543,559

) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period     418,917       2,117,622   Cash and cash equivalents, ending of period   $ 363,560     $ 1,176,729     Net Cash (Used in) Operating Activities   For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had incurred net loss from operation of $3,516,672 which posted a negative impact to the Company’s cash flow. The reconciliation on non-cash items such as interest expenses, depreciation and amortization provide positive impact on cash.   In the operation analysis, the net cash used in operating activities increased from $543,559 to $990,787.  The operation loss of $3,516,672 was partially offset by the noncash expenses such as $79,907 in depreciation, $65,822 in amortization, $307,457 in share-based compensation, $1,870,972 in interest expenses on promissory notes, $8,688 in lease interest expense and $600 from gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment. In the operating assets and liabilities, the net increase in current assets resulted from an increase of other receivables, deposits and prepayments of $110,088, an increase in inventories held of $17,320 and a decrease in accounts receivables of $4,489.  The net increase in current liabilities resulted from $202,117 increase in advances from related parties, $83,991 increase in accrued liabilities and other payables and $30,250 increase in accounts payable. The final result of the cash flow used in operating activities was $990,787.   Net Cash (Used in) Investing Activity   The net cash used by investing activity of $445,326 resulted from purchase of property, plant and equipment of $469,466, offset by proceeds on disposal of $23,000 and net cash on acquisition of a subsidiary company of $1,140 for the six months ended December 31, 2022.   Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities   The net cash provided by financing activities of $1,391,098 resulted from proceeds from shares issued of $1,376,280 and net proceeds from drawdown of loans of $50,000, set off partially by repayments to lease liabilities and related interests for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of $35,182.   The cash flow situation will not allow for operations in the coming next 12 months by self-generated cash provided from operating activities. The Company needs to increase cash flow supplies with a long term plan until the Company makes sustainable profits and has a positive cash flow. Otherwise, loans from related parties may be a temporary solution, although we have no written loan agreements. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure adequate financing. If we fail to secure sufficient funds, our business activities may be curtailed, or we may cease to operate.   Working Capital   As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalent of $363,560 and $418,917, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we have incurred accumulated operating losses of $9,810,142 and $10,357,920, respectively.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.     9 Table of Contents   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Evaluation Date”). During 2022, the Company has been undertaking tremendous changes and expansion which rendered the management to re-consider the availability of more management talents and professional staff to meet the enlargement in operation under the coming acquisition and expansion move. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   As of December 31, 2022 management also assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments Based on our consideration and evaluation, the current management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.   The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management is dominated by three individuals without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officers in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022. In the meantime, management has appointed external consultants to minimise risk and ascertain compliance of the requirements.   Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an immediate negative effect on our financial results because of our small size of operation. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements if the Company were growing substantially after the expansion move was materialized.   Changes in Internal Controls   There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the six months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     10 Table of Contents   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
