AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts) NOTE 1.     NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of the Company Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Jack Henry," "JKHY," or the "Company") is a well-rounded financial technology company. JKHY was founded in 1976 as a provider of core information processing solutions for banks. Today, the Company’s extensive array of products and services includes processing transactions, automating business processes, and managing information for approximately
7,800
financial institutions and diverse corporate entities.
Consolidation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JKHY and all of its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned, and all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, equals the Company’s net income. Allowance for Credit Losses The Company monitors trade and other receivable balances and contract assets and estimates the allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Estimates of expected credit losses are based on historical collection experience and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events. The following table summarizes allowance for credit losses activity for the fiscal quarter and year-to-date periods ended December 31, 2022, and 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Allowance for credit losses - beginning balance $ 8,030   $ 7,660   $ 7,616   $ 7,267   Current provision for expected credit losses 480   300   960   840   Write-offs charged against allowance ( 325 ) ( 227 ) ( 390 ) ( 373 ) Recoveries of amounts previously written off ( 1 ) —   ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Allowance for credit losses - ending balance $ 8,184   $ 7,733   $ 8,184   $ 8,184   $ 7,733   Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.   Accumulated depreciation at December 31, 2022, totaled $ 461,010
and at June 30, 2022, totaled $ 454,879 . Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill, customer relationships, computer software, and trade names acquired in business acquisitions in addition to internally developed computer software. The amounts are amortized, with the exception of those intangible assets with an indefinite life (such as goodwill), over an estimated economic benefit period, generally
3
to
20
years.   Accumulated amortization of intangible assets totaled $ 1,078,867
and $ 1,030,800
at December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively. 8 Table of Contents Investments At December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the Company had an investment in the preferred stock of Automated Bookkeeping, Inc ("Autobooks") of $ 18,250 , which represented a non-controlling share of the voting equity as of that date. The total investment was recorded at cost and is included within other non-current assets on the Company's balance sheet. There have been no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an impairment and no price changes resulting from observing a similar or identical investment. An impairment and/or an observable price change would be an adjustment to recorded cost. Fair value will not be estimated unless there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Common Stock The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or borrowings on its existing line of credit. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time.
At December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, there were
31,043
shares in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to
3,948
additional shares. The total cost of treasury shares at December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, was $ 1,807,118 . During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the Company did
not
repurchase any shares of its common stock. Income Taxes Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Also, interest and penalties expenses are recognized on the full amount of unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Interim Financial Statements The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") applicable to interim condensed consolidated financial statements, and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, with updates to certain policies included in this Note 1. In the opinion of the management of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) to state fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, the results of its operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, changes in stockholders' equity for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and its cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2022, was derived from audited annual financial statements, but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 9 Table of Contents Risks and Uncertainties The Company has determined there was not a material impact to the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, as a result of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company's future operational and financial performance remains uncertain and difficult to predict. The Company will continue to monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. NOTE 2.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Not Yet Adopted In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to adopt the ASU effective July 1, 2023, and will apply it prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after that date. NOTE 3.     REVENUE AND DEFERRED COSTS Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenue from data processing, transaction processing, software licensing and related services, professional services, and hardware sales. Disaggregation of Revenue The tables below present the Company's revenue disaggregated by type of revenue. Refer to Note 11, Reportable Segment Information, for disaggregated revenue by type and reportable segment. The majority of the Company’s revenue is earned domestically, with revenue from customers outside the United States comprising less than 1% of total revenue. Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Private and Public Cloud $ 153,130   $ 138,340   $ 302,129   $ 273,982   Product Delivery and Services 58,594   79,499   116,117   131,014   On-Premise Support 78,976   78,372   192,603   188,708   Services & Support 290,700   296,211   610,849   593,704   Processing 214,614   197,685   423,667   388,248   Total Revenue $ 505,314   $ 493,896   $ 1,034,516   $ 981,952   Contract Balances The following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers. December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Receivables, net $ 246,378   $ 348,072   Contract Assets - Current 24,136   24,447   Contract Assets - Non-current 68,092   68,261   Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue) - Current 214,742   330,687   Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue) - Non-current 70,101   71,485   Contract assets primarily result from revenue being recognized when or as control of a solution or service is transferred to the customer, except where invoicing is contingent upon the completion of other performance obligations or payment terms differ from the provisioning of services. The current portion of contract assets is reported within prepaid expenses and other in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, and the non-current portion is included in other non-current assets. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to consideration received from customers in advance of delivery of the related goods and services to the customer.
10 Table of Contents Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The Company analyzes contract language to identify if a significant financing component does exist and would adjust the transaction price for any material effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either party to the contract with a significant benefit of financing the transaction.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $ 83,145
and $ 94,862 , respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the periods. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $ 159,393
and $ 166,273 , respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the periods. Amounts recognized that relate to performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods were immaterial for each period presented. These adjustments are primarily the result of transaction price re-allocations due to changes in estimates of variable consideration. Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2022, estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period totaled $ 5,654,930 .
The Company expects to recognize approximately
25 % over the next
12
months,
20 % in 13-24 months, and the balance thereafter. Contract Costs The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered.
These costs consist primarily of sales commissions, which are incurred only if a contract is obtained, and customer conversion or implementation-related costs. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates, in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated.
Capitalized costs totaled $ 410,904
and $ 380,095 , at December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, amortization of deferred contract costs totaled $ 34,861
and $ 32,154 , respectively. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, amortization of deferred contract costs totaled $ 76,841
and $ 67,998 , respectively. There were no impairment losses in relation to capitalized costs for the periods presented. NOTE 4.     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS For cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, amounts receivable or payable, and short-term borrowings, fair values approximate carrying value, based on the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.
The Company's estimates of the fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: Level 1: inputs to the valuation are quoted prices in an active market for identical assets Level 2: inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly Level 3: valuation is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the Company's own estimates of assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset 11 Table of Contents Fair value of financial assets included in current assets is as follows: Estimated Fair Value Measurements Total Fair   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Value December 31, 2022       Financial Assets:  Certificates of Deposit $ —   $ 1,213   $ —   $ 1,213   Financial Liabilities: Revolving credit facility $ —   $ 275,000   $ —   $ 275,000   June 30, 2022       Financial Assets:  Certificates of Deposit $ —   $ 1,212   $ —   $ 1,212   Financial Liabilities: Revolving credit facility $ —   $ 115,000   $ —   $ 115,000   NOTE 5.     LEASES The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
The lease term begins on the commencement date, which is the date the Company takes possession of the property and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component for all asset classes, which are comprised of real estate leases and equipment leases. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the Company’s leases do not typically provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based upon the information available at commencement date. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate requires judgment and is determined by using the Company’s current unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors such as collateralization and term to align with the terms of the lease. The Company leases certain office space, data centers, and equipment with remaining terms of
1
to
11
years.
Certain leases contain renewal options for varying periods, which are at the Company’s sole discretion.
For leases where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal option, such option periods have been included in the determination of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities.
Certain leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with the leased asset.
Such amounts are not included in the measurement of the lease liability to the extent they are variable in nature. Variable lease costs are recognized as a variable lease expense when incurred. At December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the Company had operating lease assets of $ 43,743
and $ 46,869
and financing lease assets of $ 20
and $ 65 , respectively.
At December 31, 2022, total operating lease liabilities of $ 48,116
were comprised of current operating lease liabilities of $ 10,246
and noncurrent operating lease liabilities of $ 37,870 . At December 31, 2022, total financing lease liabilities of $ 21
were all current liabilities. At June 30, 2022, total operating lease liabilities of $ 51,452
were comprised of current operating lease liabilities of $ 10,681
and noncurrent operating lease liabilities of $ 40,771 . At December 31, 2022, total financing lease liabilities of $ 67
were all current financing lease liabilities. Operating lease assets are included within
other non-current assets , and operating lease liabilities are included within
accrued expenses
(current portion) and
other long-term liabilities
(noncurrent portion) in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Operating lease assets were recorded net of accumulated amortization of $ 35,636
and $ 31,006
as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively.
Financing lease assets are included within
property and equipment, net , and financing lease liabilities are included within
notes payable
(current portion) and
long-term debt
(noncurrent portion) in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Financing lease assets were recorded net of accumulated amortization of $ 295
and $ 255
as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively. Operating lease costs for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, were $ 3,029
and $ 3,327 , respectively. Financing lease costs for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, were $ 20
and $ 27 ,
12 respectively. Total operating and financing lease costs for the respective quarters included variable lease costs of $ 962
and $ 441 , respectively. Operating lease costs for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, were $ 6,088
and $ 6,759 , respectively. Financing lease costs for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, were $ 40
and $ 55 , respectively. Total operating and financing lease costs for the respective fiscal year-to-date periods included variable lease costs of $ 1,890
and $ 840 , respectively. Operating and financing lease expense are included within cost of services, research and development, and selling, general & administrative expense, dependent upon the nature and use of the ROU asset, in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of income. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company had operating cash flows for payments on operating leases of $ 6,202
and $ 6,802 , and ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities of $ 2,282
and $ 1,870 , respectively. Operating cash flows for interest paid on financing leases for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, were $ 42
and $ 55 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term for the Company's operating leases was
72
months and
76
months, and the weighted-average discount rate was
2.59 % and
2.58 %, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term for the Company's financing leases was
3
months and

2.19 % as of December 31, 2022, and
2.29 % as of June 30, 2022. Maturity of Lease Liabilities under ASC 842 Future minimum rental payments on operating leases with initial non-cancellable lease terms in excess of one year were due as follows at December 31, 2022*: Due Dates (fiscal year) Future Minimum Rental Payments 2023 (remaining period) $ 5,879   2024 10,696   2025 7,952   2026 7,046   2027 6,265   Thereafter 14,296   Total lease payments $ 52,134   Less: interest ( 4,018 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 48,116   * Financing leases were immaterial to the quarter, so a maturity of lease liabilities table has only been included for operating leases. Lease payments include $ 5,464
related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. At December 31, 2022, there were $ 6,128
of legally binding lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. NOTE 6.     DEBT Credit facilities On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into a five-year senior, unsecured amended and restated credit agreement that replaced the prior credit facility described below. The credit agreement allows for borrowings of up to $ 600,000 , which may be increased to $ 1,000,000
by the Company at any time until maturity. The credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on an adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") term rate or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest
of (i) 0%, (ii) the Prime Rate for such day, (iii) the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day
plus
0.50 % per annum and (iv) the Adjusted Term SOFR Screen Rate (without giving effect to the Applicable Margin) for a one month Interest Period on such day for Dollars
plus
1.0 %), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the Company's leverage ratio. The credit agreement is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company and is subject to various financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The amended and restated credit facility terminates
13 Table of Contents August 31, 2027 . There was $ 275,000
outstanding under the amended and restated credit facility at December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, there was a $ 115,000
outstanding balance on the prior credit facility that was entered into on February 10, 2020. The prior credit facility was a five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility. The prior credit facility allowed for borrowings of up to $ 300,000 , which could be increased by the Company to $ 700,000
at any time until maturity. The prior credit facility bore interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on a eurocurrency rate or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest of (i) 0%, (ii) the U.S. Bank prime rate for such day, (iii) the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day plus
0.50 % and (iv) the eurocurrency rate for a one-month interest period on such day for dollars
plus
1.0 %), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the Company's leverage ratio. The prior credit facility was guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company and was subject to various financial covenants that required the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the prior credit agreement. As of June 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The prior credit facility's termination date was
February 10, 2025 . Other lines of credit The Company has an unsecured bank credit line which provides for funding of up to $ 5,000
and bears interest at the prime rate less
1 %. The credit line expires on
April 30, 2023 . There was
no
balance outstanding at December 31, 2022, or June 30, 2022.
Interest The Company paid interest of $ 2,724
and $ 604
during the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. NOTE 7.     INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, with an effective tax rate of
23.2 % of income before income taxes, compared to
23.6 % in the prior fiscal year quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a larger excess tax benefit received from share-based compensation in the current fiscal year quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate decreased compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, with an effective tax rate of
23.4 % of income before taxes, compared to
23.5 % for the same period last fiscal year. The Company paid income taxes, net of refunds, of $ 37,213
and $ 40,687
in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 10,214
of gross unrecognized tax benefits before interest and penalties, $ 9,083
of which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $ 1,546
and $ 1,425
related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal 2019 and all subsequent years remain subject to examination as of December 31, 2022, under statute of limitations rules. The U.S. state income tax returns that remain subject to examination as of December 31, 2022, under the statute of limitation rules varies by state jurisdiction from fiscal 2016 through 2019 and all subsequent years. The Company anticipates potential changes due to lapsing of statutes of limitations, and examination closures could reduce the unrecognized tax benefits balance by $ 1,500
to $ 3,500
within twelve months of December 31, 2022. NOTE 8.     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Our operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, included $ 7,545
and $ 6,956
of stock-based compensation costs, respectively. Our operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, included $ 14,544
and $ 13,027
of stock-based compensation costs, respectively. Stock Options On November 10, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("2015 EIP") for its employees and non-employee directors. The plan allows for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock shares or units, and performance shares or units.
The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan is
3,000 .
For stock options, terms and vesting periods of the options are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors when granted.
The option period must expire not more than
ten years
from the option grant date. The options granted under this plan are exercisable beginning
three years
after the grant date at an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the grant date.
The options terminate upon surrender of the option,
ninety days
after termination of employment, upon the expiration of
one year
following notification of a deceased optionee, or
ten years
after grant. 14 Table of Contents A summary of option plan activity under this plan is as follows:   Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate  Intrinsic  Value Outstanding July 1, 2022 12   $ 87.27     Granted —   —     Forfeited —   —     Exercised —   —     Outstanding December 31, 2022 12   $ 87.27   $ 1,032   Vested and Expected to Vest December 31, 2022 12   $ 87.27   $ 1,032   Exercisable December 31, 2022 12   $ 87.27   $ 1,032   At December 31, 2022, there was
no
compensation cost yet to be recognized related to outstanding options. For options currently exercisable, the weighted average remaining contractual term (remaining period of exercisability) as of December 31, 2022, was
3.5
years. Restricted Stock Unit Awards The Company issues unit awards under the 2015 EIP.
The following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock unit awards as of December 31, 2022: Unit awards Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding July 1, 2022 303   $ 166.50   Granted 124   219.65   Vested ( 91 ) 167.18   Forfeited ( 13 ) 187.68   Outstanding December 31, 2022 323   $ 185.86   $ 56,803   The
124
unit awards granted in fiscal 2023 had service requirements and performance measures, with
82
only having service requirements. The unit awards with only service requirements were valued at the weighted average fair value of the non-vested units based on the fair market value of the Company’s equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of expected future dividends to be declared during the vesting period, consistent with the methodology for calculating compensation expense on such awards.
The remaining
42
unit awards granted in fiscal 2023 have performance measures along with service requirements.
17
of these performance and service requirement unit awards were valued at grant by estimating 100% payout at release and using the fair market value of the Company equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of expected future dividends to be declared during the vesting period. The payout at release of approximately half of these unit awards will be determined based on the Company's compound annual growth rate for revenue (excluding adjustments) for the three-year vesting period compared against goal thresholds as defined in the award agreement. The performance payout at release of the other half of these unit awards will be determined based on the expansion of the Company's non-GAAP operating margin over the three-year vesting period compared against goal thresholds as defined in the award agreement. The other
25
performance and service requirement unit awards were valued at grant using a Monte Carlo pricing model as of the measurement date customized to the specific provisions of the Company’s plan design. Per the Company's award vesting and settlement provisions, the awards that utilize a Monte Carlo pricing model were valued at grant on the basis of Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") in comparison to the compensation peer group made up of participants approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors for fiscal year 2023.
The Monte Carlo inputs used in the model to estimate fair value at the measurement date and resulting values for these performance unit awards are as follows.

of compensation expense, excluding forfeitures, that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock unit awards, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of
1.32
years. NOTE 9.     EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table reflects the reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share. Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Net Income $ 80,775   $ 95,670   $ 187,324   $ 197,783   Common share information: Weighted average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share 72,962   73,580   72,929   73,798   Dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units 182   117   212 122 Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share 73,144   73,697   73,141   73,920   Basic earnings per share $ 1.11   $ 1.30   $ 2.57   $ 2.68   Diluted earnings per share $ 1.10   $ 1.30   $ 2.56   $ 2.68   Per share information is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Stock options and restricted stock units have been included in the calculation of earnings per share to the extent they are dilutive. There were
31

August 31, 2022 , the Company acquired all of the equity interest in Payrailz, LLC ("Payrailz"). The final purchase price, following customary post-closing adjustments to the extent actual closing date working capital, cash, debt, and unpaid seller transaction expenses exceeded or were less than the amounts estimated at closing, was $ 230,205 . Pursuant to the merger agreement for the transaction, $ 48,500
of the purchase price was placed in an escrow account at the closing, consisting of $ 2,500
for any final purchase price adjustments owed by the sellers, which amount was released to the sellers on December 15, 2022, in connection with post-closing adjustments, and $ 46,000
for indemnification matters under the merger agreement. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's digital financial management solutions and the purchase was funded by our revolving line of credit (Note 6) and cash generated from operations. Payrailz provides cloud-native, API-first, AI-enabled consumer and commercial digital payment solutions and experiences that enable money to be moved in the moment of need. Management has completed a preliminary purchase price allocation and assessment of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of
August 31, 2022 , and taking into account the post-closing purchase price adjustment described above, are set forth below: Current assets $ 1,851   Identifiable intangible assets 119,868   Deferred revenue ( 8,104 ) Total other liabilities assumed ( 749 ) Total identifiable net assets 112,866   Goodwill 117,339   Net assets acquired $ 230,205   The amounts shown above include a measurement period adjustment made during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 related to a working capital adjustment. The amounts shown above may change as management continues to evaluate the income tax implications of this business combination. The goodwill of $ 117,339
arising from this acquisition consists largely of the growth potential, synergies, and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company with those of Payrailz, together with the value of Payrailz's assembled workforce. The goodwill from this acquisition has been allocated to our Payments segment and $ 117,339
is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Identifiable intangible assets from this acquisition consist of customer relationships of $ 6,109 , computer software of $ 112,505 , and other intangible assets of $ 1,254 . The amortization period for acquired customer relationships, computer software, and other intangible assets is over a term of
15
years,
10
years, and
15
years, respectively. Current assets were inclusive of cash acquired of $ 577 . The fair value of current assets acquired included accounts receivable of $ 978 ,
none
of which were expected to be uncollectible. Costs incurred related to the acquisition of Payrailz during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, totaled $ 50
and $ 508 , respectively, for administrative and professional services, travel, and other fees, and were expensed as incurred and reported within cost of revenue and selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company's condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, included revenue of $ 2,578
and $ 3,316 , respectively, and after-tax net loss of $ 5,387
and $ 7,251 , respectively, resulting from Payrailz's operations.

The Company’s operations are classified into
four
reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate & Other.
The Core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized customer/member information. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit, and credit card transaction processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, Automated Clearing House ("ACH") origination and remote deposit capture processing, and risk management products and services.
The Complementary segment provides additional software and services that can be integrated with our Core solutions, and many can be used independently. The Corporate & Other segment includes hardware revenue and costs, as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors, including performance against trend, budget, and forecast. Only revenue and costs of revenue are considered in the evaluation for each segment.
Immaterial adjustments have been made to reclassify revenue that was recognized for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, from the Complementary to the Payments and Corporate and Other segments. Immaterial adjustments were also made to reclassify cost of revenue from the Complementary to the Payments and Corporate and Other segments for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. These reclasses were made to be consistent with the current allocation of revenue and cost of revenue by segment. Revenue reclassed for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, from Complementary to Payments was $ 2,977
and $ 5,946 , respectively, and from Complementary to Corporate and Other was $ 2,207

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. OVERVIEW Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. ("JKHY") is a well-rounded financial technology company and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations. Its solutions consist of integrated data processing systems solutions to U.S. banks ranging from de novo to multi-billion-dollar institutions, core data processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes, and non-core highly specialized core-agnostic products and services that enable financial institutions of every asset size and charter, and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry, to mitigate and control risks, optimize revenue and growth opportunities, and contain costs. JKHY's integrated solutions are available for on-premise installation and delivery in our private cloud.
Our two primary revenue streams are "services and support" and "processing." Services and support includes: "private and public cloud" fees that predominantly have contract terms of seven years or longer at inception; "product delivery and services" revenue, which includes revenue from the sales of licenses, implementation services, deconversion fees, consulting, and hardware; and "on-premise support" revenue, composed of maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms. Processing revenue includes: "remittance" revenue from payment processing, remote capture, and ACH transactions; "card" fees, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and "transaction and digital" revenue, which includes transaction and mobile processing fees.
We continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins.
All amounts in the following discussion are in thousands, except per share amounts. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 2%, or $11,418, compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2022. Total revenue less deconversion fee and acquisition revenues of $6,380 and $2,578, respectively, for the current fiscal quarter and less deconversion fee revenues of $26,903 for the prior fiscal quarter, results in an increase of 6%, quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by growth in data processing and hosting, card processing, transaction and digital, and remittance revenues. Operating expenses increased 8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Total operating expenses less deconversion expenses of $917, the acquisition-related expenses of $6,907, plus the gain on disposal of assets, net, of $1,207, for the current fiscal quarter, and reducing operating expenses by deconversion expenses of $2,547 for the prior fiscal year quarter, results in a 7% increase quarter over quarter. This increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel costs, including benefits expenses, resulting from a 4% headcount increase in the trailing twelve months, increased direct costs in line with related revenue increases, and higher amortization of intangible assets. Operating income decreased 15% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Total operating income less deconversion fee operating income of $5,463, plus an acquisition operating loss of $4,329, less the gain on disposal of assets, net, of $1,207 for the current fiscal quarter, and less deconversion fee operating income of $24,356 for the prior fiscal quarter, results in a 4% increase quarter over quarter. This increase in operating income was primarily driven by increased revenue growth partially offset by increased operating expenses detailed above. The provision for income taxes decreased 17% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year second quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 23.2% compared to 23.6% for the same quarter a year ago. Due to the above changes, net income decreased 16% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Total net income less deconversion fee net income of $4,111, plus acquisition net loss of $5,405, less the gain on disposal of assets, net, of $909 for the current fiscal quarter, and less deconversion fee net income of $18,352 for the prior fiscal quarter, results in a 5% increase quarter over quarter. 21 Table of Contents For the six months ended December 31, 2022, total revenue increased 5%, or $52,564, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2022. Total revenue less deconversion fee and acquisition revenues of $10,899 and $3,316, respectively, for the current fiscal period and less deconversion fee revenues of $30,627 for the prior fiscal period, results in an increase of 7%, period over period. This increase was primarily driven by growth in data processing and hosting, card processing, transaction and digital, remittance, and software usage fee revenues. Operating expenses increased 9% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2022. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased personnel costs, including benefits expenses, resulting from a 4% headcount increase in the trailing twelve months, higher direct costs in line with related revenue increases, and higher amortization of intangible assets. Operating income decreased 4% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2022. Total operating income less deconversion fee operating income of $9,329, plus an acquisition operating loss of $6,126, less the gain on disposal of assets, net, of $7,384 for the current fiscal period, less deconversion fee operating income of $27,540 for the prior fiscal period, results in a 3% increase period over period. This increase in operating income was primarily driven by increased revenue growth partially offset by increased operating expenses detailed above. The provision for income taxes decreased 6% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2022. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022, was 23.4% compared to 23.5% for the same period a year ago. Due to the above changes, net income decreased 5% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period a year ago. Total net income less deconversion fee net income of $7,020, plus acquisition net loss of $7,275, less the gain on disposal of assets, net, of $5,556 for the current fiscal period, and less deconversion fee net income of
$20,751 for the prior fiscal period, results in a 3% increase period over period. Our second fiscal quarter was significantly impacted by a recent rapid slowdown of merger and acquisition activity in the financial institution industry, which has caused decreases in deconversion fee revenue, as noted, and in conversion/merger services revenue. However, we move into the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with significant portions of our business continuing to come from recurring revenues and our sales pipeline remaining encouraging. Our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address, and we believe they have a great need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability, efficiency, and security. Our strong balance sheet, access to extensive lines of credit, the continued strength of our existing lines of revenue, and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service should position us well to address current and future opportunities.
A detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, follows. Discussions compare the current fiscal year's three and six months ended December 31, 2022, to the prior fiscal year's three and six months ended December 31, 2021.

Reducing services and support revenue for deconversion fee revenue from each quarter, which was $6,380 for the current fiscal quarter and $26,903 for the prior fiscal year quarter and acquisition revenue of $19 for the current fiscal quarter, results in growth of 6% quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by growth in data processing and hosting revenue. Services and support revenue increased 3% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period a year ago. Reducing services and support revenue for deconversion fee revenue from each period, which was $10,899 for the current fiscal period and $30,627 for the prior fiscal period, and acquisition revenue of $43 for the current fiscal period, results in growth of 7% period over period. This increase was primarily driven by growth in data processing and hosting and software usage fee revenues. Growth in software usage fee revenues reflects a continuing shift of customers to our time-based license model. 22 Table of Contents Processing Three Months Ended December 31, % Change Six Months Ended December 31, % Change   2022 2021   2022 2021   Processing $ 214,614   $ 197,685  9   % $ 423,667   $ 388,248  9   % Percentage of total revenue 42   % 40  %   41   % 40  %   Processing revenue increased 9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. Reducing processing revenue for acquisition revenue of $2,559 for the current fiscal quarter, results in growth of 7% quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher card processing, payment processing, including iPay and Payrailz, and Jack Henry digital revenue, including Banno, as well as other processing fee revenues, primarily due to expanding volumes. Processing revenue increased 9% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period last fiscal year. Reducing processing revenue for acquisition revenue of $3,273 for the current fiscal period, results in growth of
8% period over period.

OPERATING EXPENSES Cost of Revenue Three Months Ended December 31, % Change Six Months Ended December 31, % Change   2022 2021   2022 2021   Cost of Revenue $ 304,589   $ 282,825  8   % $ 602,849   $ 559,460  8   % Percentage of total revenue 60   % 57  %   58   % 57  %   Cost of revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 8% over the prior fiscal year second quarter. Reducing cost of revenue for deconversion costs from each quarter, which were $555 for the current fiscal year quarter and $1,601 for the prior fiscal year quarter, and for acquisition costs of $5,861 from the current fiscal year quarter, results in a 6% increase quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs, including benefits expenses, resulting from a 1% headcount increase in the trailing twelve months, higher direct costs in line with related increases in revenue, and increased amortization of intangible assets. Cost of revenue increased 3% compared to the prior fiscal year quarter as a percentage of total revenue. Cost of revenue increased 8% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period last fiscal year.

REPORTABLE SEGMENT DISCUSSION The Company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations.
The Company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The Core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized customer/member information. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit, and credit card processing services; online and mobile bill pay solutions; ACH origination and remote deposit capture processing; and risk management products and services. The Complementary segment provides additional software, hosted processing platforms, and services, including call center support, and network security management, consulting, and monitoring, that can be integrated with our core solutions and many can be used independently. The Corporate and Other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments, as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments.

Reducing Core revenue for deconversion fee revenue in both periods, which totaled $2,115 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and $10,853 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, results in a 6% increase quarter over quarter. Cost of revenue increased 6% quarter over quarter primarily due to higher personnel costs and increased direct support costs. Cost of revenue increased 2% as a percentage of revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2022.
Revenue in the Core segment increased 3% and cost of revenue increased 7% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. Reducing Core revenue for deconversion fee revenue in both periods, which totaled $3,933 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and $13,021 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, results in a 6% increase period over period. This increase in Core revenue over the prior fiscal year period was primarily driven by the growth in data processing and hosting and software usage fee revenues. Cost of revenue increased 7% period over period primarily due to increased direct support costs and higher personnel costs. Cost of revenue increased 1% as a percentage of revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period of fiscal 2022.

Revenue in the Corporate and Other segment decreased 5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the equivalent quarter of the prior fiscal year. The decrease quarter over quarter was primarily due to lower user group revenues due to differences in the timing of the user conference year over year. Cost of revenue for the Corporate and Other segment includes operating costs not directly attributable to any of the other three segments. The cost of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 6% when compared to the prior fiscal year quarter primarily due to higher internal licenses and fees and personnel costs. Revenue in the Corporate and Other segment increased 20% for the six months ended December 31, 2022,
compared to the equivalent period of the prior fiscal year. The increase period over period was primarily due to higher services and support revenue.

Cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock, for capital expenditures, and acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2023 totaled $301,192 and included: $229,628 for an acquisition; $81,046 for the ongoing enhancements and development of existing and new product and service offerings; capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $17,376; and $1,027 for the purchase and development of internal use software. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $27,885. Cash used in investing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2022 totaled $101,052 and included $71,353 for the development of software; capital expenditures of $22,373; and $7,364 for the purchase and development of internal use software. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $38.
Financing activities provided cash of $87,457 for the first six months of fiscal 2023 and included borrowings on credit facilities of $365,000. This was partially offset by payments on credit facilities of $205,042, dividends paid to stockholders of $71,454 and $1,047 net cash outflow from the issuance of stock and tax withholding related to stock-based compensation. Financing activities used cash of $118,171 in the first six months of fiscal 2022 including repurchase of treasury stock of $193,917, $80,065 for repayments on credit facilities and financing leases, and $67,696 for the payment of dividends.

Capital Requirements and Resources The Company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaling $17,376 and $22,373 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities. These additions were funded from cash generated by operations. Total consolidated capital expenditures on facilities and equipment for the Company for fiscal year 2023 are expected to be approximately $57,000 and have been or will be funded from our credit facilities and cash generated by operations. On August 31, 2022, the Company acquired all of the equity interest in Payrailz, LLC ("Payrailz"). The final purchase price, following customary post-closing adjustments to the extent actual closing date working capital, cash, debt, and unpaid seller transaction expenses exceeded or were less than the amounts estimated at closing, was $230,205. Pursuant to the merger agreement for the transaction, $48,500 of the purchase price was placed in an escrow account at the closing, consisting of $2,500 for any final purchase price adjustments owed by the sellers, which amount was released to the sellers on December 15, 2022, in connection with post-closing adjustments, and $46,000 for indemnification matters under the merger agreement. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's digital financial management solutions and the purchase was funded by our revolving line of credit and cash generated from operations. Payrailz provides cloud-native, API-first, AI-enabled consumer and commercial digital payment solutions and experiences that enable money to be moved in the moment of need. 27 On September 29, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Twilio Inc., which added contractual spend obligations for the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2027, of $16,350. This commitment is in addition to the commitments discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the Company renewed an agreement with Microsoft, Inc., which added contractual spend obligations for the period January 1, 2023, through June 30, 2026, of $20,000 for Microsoft Azure Cloud services, and added contractual spend obligations for the period January 1, 2023, through June 30, 2026, of $49,000 for Server and Application licensing under the Microsoft Server and Cloud Enrollment Program. The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or borrowings on its existing line of credit. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time.
At December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, there were 31,043 shares in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 3,948 additional shares. The total cost of treasury shares at December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, was $1,807,118. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA made several changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and tax incentives to promote clean energy. The Company does not expect the IRA to have a material impact on its financial statements.
Credit facilities On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into a five-year senior, unsecured amended and restated credit agreement that replaced the prior credit agreement described below. The credit agreement allows for borrowings of up to $600,000, which may be increased by the Company to $1,000,000 at any time until maturity. The credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on an adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") term rate or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest
of (i) 0%, (ii) the Prime Rate for such day, (iii) the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day
plus
0.50% per annum and (iv) the Adjusted Term SOFR Screen Rate (without giving effect to the Applicable Margin) for a one month Interest Period on such day for Dollars
plus
1.0%), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the Company's leverage ratio. The credit agreement is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company and is subject to various financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The amended and restated credit facility terminates August 31, 2027. There was $275,000 outstanding under the amended and restated credit facility at December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, there was a $115,000 outstanding balance on the prior credit facility that was entered into on February 10, 2020. The prior credit facility was a five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility. The credit facility allowed for borrowings of up to $300,000, which could be increased by the Company to $700,000 at any time until maturity. The prior credit facility bore interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on a eurocurrency rate or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest of (i) 0%, (ii) the U.S. Bank prime rate for such day, (iii) the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day plus 0.50% and (iv) the eurocurrency rate for a one-month interest period on such day for dollars
plus
1.0%), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the Company's leverage ratio. The prior credit facility was guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company and was subject to various financial covenants that required the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the prior credit agreement. As of June 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The prior credit facility's termination date was February 10, 2025. The increase in the outstanding credit facility balance of $160,000 at December 31, 2022, compared to June 30, 2022, was primarily due to the acquisition of Payrailz during the six months ended December 31, 2022. This borrowing, along with recent increases in prevailing interest rates, is expected to contribute to increased interest expense during fiscal 2023, and until our outstanding balances are reduced. Other lines of credit The Company has an unsecured bank credit line which provides for funding of up to $5,000 and bears interest at the prime rate less 1%. The credit line was renewed in March 2021 and expires on April 30, 2023.
At December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, no amount was outstanding. ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Dollar amounts in this item are in thousands. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument
28 or group of financial instruments. We are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and at times are exposed to interest rate risk on outstanding debt.
We do not currently use any derivative financial instruments. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management. Based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base, we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We had $275,000 outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of December 31, 2022, and a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase our annual interest expense by $2,750. ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation (required in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b)), the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. For this purpose, disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
