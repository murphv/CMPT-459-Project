SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended January 31, 2023, and 2022, have
been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that permit reduced
disclosure for interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the period ended January 31, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending July 31, 2023. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets information as of January 31, 2023, was derived
from the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended July 31, 2022, included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 31, 2022. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with that
report.
Basis
of consolidation
The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Use
of estimates
Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revenue
recognition
The
Company follows the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts. ASC 606 creates a five-step model
that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or
agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction
price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect
the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.
Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of wellness and beauty services to customers via Company owned outlets, franchised outlets
or distribution of our product to third party wellness and beauty salon.
Cost
of revenue
Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services and product incurred to provide wellness and beauty services and purchase of products.
Cash
and cash equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.
Property,
plant and equipment
Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational:
SCHEDULE

the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive losses.

(UNAUDITED)
Impairment
of long-live assets
Long-lived
assets primarily include trademark of the Company. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360,
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets , the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of
each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as significant sustained change in the business climate.
The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount
of the asset.
Leases
The
Company recognizes lease payments for its short-term lease on a straight-line basis over the lease term in accordance with ASC 842.
The
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Costs associated
with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease.
In
determining the present value of the unpaid lease payments, ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company
leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. The Company
incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments.
Inventories
Inventories
consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due
to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and
promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of
revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ” (“ASC Topic 740”).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain
tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
The
Company conducts major businesses in China and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company
will file tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authority.
Going
concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
For
the period ended January 31, 2023, the Company has generated revenue of $ 128,241
and continuously incurred a net loss of $ 51,151 . As
of January 31, 2023, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $ 2,440,332 , capital deficiency of $ 584,780
and negative operating
cash flows of $ 28,629 . The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving the profitability and the
continuing financial support from its shareholders and director. Management believes the existing shareholders, director or external
financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due.
These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

Net
loss per share
The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 “ Earnings Per Share ”. Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per
share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive.
Foreign
currencies translation
Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss.
The
functional currency of the parent Company is United States dollar and the functional currency of the subsidiaries MU Worldwide Group
Limited (Seychelles) and MU Global Holding Limited (Hong Kong) is United States dollar. MU Global Health Management (Shanghai) Limited
is in Renminbi.
The
reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiary is United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements
have been expressed in US$.
In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into
US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “ Translation of Financial Statement” , using the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation
of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within the
statements of stockholders’ equity.

Fair
value of financial instruments :
The
carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, account receivables, amount due to a director,
and accounts payable and approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ” (“ASC 820-10”),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level
1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level
2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level
3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
Recent
accounting pronouncements
The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of
any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
In
May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement
of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments
in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification.
The amendments in this Update address those stakeholders’ concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option
for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase
comparability of financial statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets.
Furthermore, the targeted transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13
while still providing financial statement users with decision-useful information. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10,
which to update the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for private companies, not-for-profit organizations and certain smaller reporting
companies applying for credit losses, leases, and hedging standard. The new effective date for these preparers is for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2022. ASU 2019-05 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2023
as the Company is qualified as a smaller reporting company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2019-05 may have on its
consolidated financial statements.

(c)
Exchange rate risk
The
operation of the Company’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We
have experienced foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile
foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The Company has not historically
used financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exchange rate risks.
The
currencies that create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are RMB, HK$, and TWD. The Company translates all assets
and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense activity at the approximate rate of
exchange at the transaction date.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC
280, “Segment Reporting” establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with
the Company’s internal organization structure as well as information about services categories, business segments and major customers
in financial statements. In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of the ASC, the Company’s chief operating
decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about
allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to
segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures
about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material
operating units qualify for aggregation under “Segment Reporting” due to their similar customer base and similarities in
economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
On
January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus
originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally
beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure
globally. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and because the Company conducts major businesses in China, the
Company’s business and results of operations have been affected for the previous periods.
Since
the late 2022, the Chinese governments took comprehensive steps to relax many of their COVID-19 control measures, which enabled us to
resume more normal operations in China. Any future impact of COVID-19 on the
financial performance
of the Company will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related restrictions and the
impact of COVID-19 on the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the overall economy is impacted
for an extended period, the Company’s future operating results may be materially adversely affected.
21.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In
accordance with ASC Topic 855, “ Subsequent Events ”, which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure
of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, the Company has evaluated all subsequent
events through the filing date of this Form 10-K with the SEC, to ensure that this filing includes appropriate disclosure of events both
recognized in the financial statements as of January 31, 2023, and events which occurred subsequently but were not recognized in the
financial statements. During the period, there was no subsequent event that required recognition or disclosure.

ITEM
4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:
We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of January 31, 2023. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of January 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended January 31, 2023, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
