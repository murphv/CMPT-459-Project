CFSB Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary
Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NATURE OF BUSINESS Basis of presentation and consolidation These unaudited consolidated financial statements of CFSB Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") include the accounts of Colonial Federal Savings Bank (the “Bank”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Beach Street Security Corporation, which was established for the purpose of buying, holding and selling securities. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation are reflected in these unaudited consolidated financial statements, and all adjustments made are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. Business The Bank conducts operations from its three full-service banking offices and one limited-service banking office located in Quincy, Holbrook and Weymouth, Massachusetts, all within Norfolk County. The Bank considers its primary lending market area to be Norfolk and Plymouth Counties; however, the Bank occasionally makes loans secured by properties located outside of its primary lending market. The Bank's business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, multi-family real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions, the Bank will continue its focus on growing its balance sheet and improving profitability by continuing to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and increasing the origination of multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Reorganization and Offering On January 12, 2022, the Bank reorganized from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a two-tier mutual holding company structure. As part of the reorganization, a mutual holding company (the “MHC”) was formed as a federal corporation, into which all of the current voting rights of the members of the Bank were transferred. As part of the reorganization, the Bank converted to a federal stock savings bank. A stock holding company (the “Holding Company”) was established as a federal corporation and a majority-owned subsidiary of the MHC at all times so long as the MHC remains in existence. Concurrently with the reorganization, the Holding Company offered for sale
43 % of its common stock in a stock offering and contributed
2 % of its common stock to a charitable foundation established as a part of the reorganization. The remainder of the Holding Company common stock is held by the MHC. The Holding Company offered shares of common stock for sale on a priority basis to depositors of the Bank and the tax qualified employee plans of the Bank. The Company sold
2,804,306
shares of common stock at $ 10.00
per share for gross offering proceeds of $ 28.0
million.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") As part
of the reorganization stock offering, the Bank established the Colonial Federal Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan to provide eligible employees of the Bank the opportunity to own Company stock. The ESOP is a tax-qualified retirement plan for the benefit of Bank employees. The ESOP was funded through the purchase of
255,648
shares through a loan from the Company.
The cost of shares issued to the ESOP, but not yet allocated to participants, is shown as a reduction of stockholders' equity. The Company records compensation expense for the ESOP equal to fair market value of shares when they are committed to be released from the suspense account to participants' accounts under the plan.

Use of estimates In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited consolidated balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are the allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. While management uses current information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions or other factors. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews the Bank's allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, management may have to adjust the allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is management's responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. Management believes that the deferred tax provision was adequate as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 . In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” management uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If currently available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management exercises significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. These judgments require management to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates management makes in determining the deferred tax assets are inherently subjective and are reviewed on a regular basis as regulatory, economic or business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance that results in additional income tax expense in the period in which it is recognized would negatively affect earnings. Management believes, based upon current facts, that it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the federal and state portion of its deferred tax asset.

CFSB Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   Recent accounting pronouncements On June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. The ASU also requires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. This ASU, as amended, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, which may be material.

At December 31, 2022,
278
debt securities had unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of
11.92 %
from the Bank’s amortized cost basis. These unrealized losses are the result of changes in the interest rate environment and there have been no downgrades in the investment quality of these securities. The contractual terms of these securities do not permit the entities to settle the security at a price less than par value. Because the Bank does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, it does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022. There were
no
sales of securities during the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022 . There were
no
sales of securities during the three months ended
December 31, 2021 . Proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale was $ 2.0
million for the
six months ended December 31, 2021 , resulting in realized gains of $ 48,000 .

CFSB Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   Credit Quality Information The Bank utilizes an internal loan rating system for residential real estate, commercial real estate and construction loans as follows: Pass: Loans in this category are considered to pose low to average risk. Passed assets are generally protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of collateral pledged. Special Mention:
Loans in this category possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management’s close attention. If uncorrected, such deficiencies or weaknesses may expose the Bank to an increased risk of loss. Substandard:
Loans in this category are considered to be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. These assets have a well-defined weakness and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful:
Loans in this category have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. Loss: Loans in this category are considered uncollectible and continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. Loans in this category are generally charged-off. On an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Bank formally reviews the ratings on all commercial real estate and construction loans. On a monthly basis, the Bank reviews the residential and other loan portfolios for credit quality primarily through the use of delinquency reports. The following table presents information on the Bank’s loans by risk ratings:

8. MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Federal banking regulations require minimum capital requirements for community banking institutions as set forth in the following table. Additionally, community banking institutions must maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount greater than
2.5 % of total risk-weighted assets to avoid being subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. At
December 31, 2022, the Bank met the required capital conservation buffer.
As of December 31, 2022, the most recent notification from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum capital ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category. The Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are also presented in the table below.

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Loan commitments The Bank is a party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and advance funds on lines of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The Bank’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. At
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk:

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for construction loans and lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The Bank evaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis and the commitments are collateralized by real estate. Operating lease commitments The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), on July 1, 2022 and began recognizing operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet by recording a Right-Of-Use ("ROU") asset, representing the Company's legal right to use the leased assets and a net lease liability, representing the Company's legal obligation to make these lease payments. The Company, by policy, does not include renewal options for leases as part of its ROU asset and lease liabilities unless they are deemed reasonably certain to exercise. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was
9.38
years and the weighted average discount rate used in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was
3.56 % . At December 31, 2022 , the Company had entered into two non-cancelable operating lease agreements for branch locations, one of which contains a renewal option to extend lease payments for a period of
five years . The Company recognized ROUs and operating lease liabilities totaling $ 1.0
million at July 1, 2022.

11. FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Determination of fair value The Bank uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in some instances, quoted market prices may not be available. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques, including collateral value. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. Fair value hierarchy The Bank groups its assets that are measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. Level 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active exchange markets for identical assets. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Valuation is based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Level 3 – Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets. Level 3 assets include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, securities available for sale were measured at Level 2 with a fair value of $ 168,000
and $ 199,000 , respectively. All fair value measurements are obtained from a third-party pricing service and are not adjusted by management. Securities measured at fair value in Level 2 are based on pricing models that consider standard input factors such as observable market data, benchmark yields, interest rate volatilities, broker/dealer quotes, credit spreads and new issue data. There are
no
securities measured at fair value in Levels 1 and 3. There are
no
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at
December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis The Bank may also be required, from time to time, to measure certain other financial assets on a non-recurring basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. There are
no
assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at
December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022.     28

Ite m 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
This discussion and analysis reflects our unaudited consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements, which appear beginning on page F-1 of Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income and, to a lesser extent, non-interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, securities and other interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits. Non-interest income consists primarily of earnings on bank-owned life insurance, service charges on deposit accounts and other income. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for loan losses and non-interest expense. Non-interest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing costs, advertising, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance premiums and other expenses. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “plan,” “seek,” “expect,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “indicate,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “target” and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:
• statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;
• statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;
• statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and
• estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.
These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements:
• conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the severity and duration of any associated economic slowdown either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected, including potential recessionary conditions;
• general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected;
• changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses;
• our ability to access cost-effective funding;
• fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions;
• demand for loans and deposits in our market area;
• our ability to implement and change our business strategy;
• competition among depository and other financial institutions;
30
• inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans we have made and make;
• adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets;
• changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums or changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of the U.S. Treasury or Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System;
• changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios;
• technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected;
• the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected;
• a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks;
• our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk;
• our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;
• our ability to successfully integrate into our operations any assets, liabilities, customers, systems and management personnel we may acquire and our ability to realize related revenue synergies and cost savings within expected time frames, and any goodwill charges related thereto;
• changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;
• changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;
• the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical event;
• our ability to retain key employees;
• our compensation expense associated with equity allocated or awarded to our employees; and
• changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own.
Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.
The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company,” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
31
Allowance for Loan Losses.
The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of a loan receivable is charged off as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely. No portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as a critical accounting policy.
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a given borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. We do not separately identify consumer loans for impairment disclosure unless such loans are subject to a troubled debt restructuring agreement. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class not considered impaired. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These qualitative risk factors include: (1) levels and trends in delinquent, classified, non-accrual and impaired loans, as well as loan modifications; (2) trends in the nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans and the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in level of such concentrations; (3) effects of the changes in risk selection and lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices; (4) experience, ability, and depth of lending department management and other relevant staff; and (5) national, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans. Each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management's best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. An unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimated specific and general losses in the portfolio.
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.
Deferred Income Taxes.
At December 31, 2022, we had a net deferred tax asset totaling $1.0 million. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If currently available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established if it is not more likely than not realizable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets are inherently subjective and are reviewed on a regular basis as regulatory or business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax
32
assets. A valuation allowance that results in additional income tax expense in the period in which it is recognized would negatively affect income. Management believes, based upon current facts, that it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize its federal and state deferred tax asset.
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three and six months
ended December 31, 2022.
For additional information on our critical accounting policies, please refer to the information contained in Note 1 of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements within our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022
Total Assets.
Total assets decreased $9.4 million, or 2.6%, to $356.8 million at December 31, 2022 from $366.2 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease resulted primarily from decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $21.1 million, or 66.6%, partially offset by increases in securities held to maturity of $4.3 million, or 3.0%, and net loans of $6.0 million, or 3.5%. The Company adopted Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2016-02-Leases (Topic 842) on July 1, 2022 and began recognizing operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet by recording a Right-Of-Use asset, representing the Company's legal right to use the leased assets and a net lease liability, representing the Company's legal obligation to make these lease payments, which resulted in an increase of $1.0 million in total assets and total liabilities at December 31, 2022.
Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased $21.1
million, or 66.6%, to $10.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $31.7 million at June 30, 2022, because we invested excess cash into securities and loans to increase our overall yield on interest-earning assets.
Net Loans.
Net loans increased $6.0 million, or 3.5%, to $178.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $172.6 million at June 30, 2022. The increase was due primarily to increases in commercial real estate loans of $6.3 million, or 42.8%, and $620,000, or 31.5%, in second mortgages and home equity lines of credit, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million, or 7.5%, in multi-family real estate loans. The growth in commercial real estate loans was the result of increased loan originations and the Bank's continued focus on growing and diversifying the loan portfolio.
Securities Available for Sale.
Securities available for sale decreased $31,000, or 15.6%, to $168,000 at December 31, 2022 from $199,000 at June 30, 2022. The decrease was due to prepayments and the decline in fair value due to the rising interest rate environment.
Securities Held to Maturity.
Securities held to maturity increased $4.3 million, or 3.0%, to $149.5 million at December 31, 2022 from $145.2 million at June 30, 2022, as we invested excess cash into securities to increase our overall yield on interest-earning assets.
Total Liabilities.
Total liabilities decreased $10.3 million, or 3.5%, to $281.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $291.9 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was the result of decreases in deposits of $11.6 million, or 4.0%, partially offset by the new operating lease liability of $1.0 million.
Deposits.
Deposits decreased $11.6 million, or 4.0%, to $275.5 million at December 31, 2022 from $287.1 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $5.8 million, or 7.7%, in savings accounts, and $9.5 million, or 20.2%, in money market accounts, partially offset by increases of $696,000, or 1.1%, in negotiable order of withdrawal and demand deposit accounts and $3.1 million, or 3.1%, in term certificates. The decrease reflects management's decision not to increase interest rates for savings and money market accounts, due to excess liquidity for the first quarter of the fiscal year. During the second quarter of the fiscal year, the Bank held term certificate promotions, which contributed to the increase in the balance of term certificates.
Stockholders' Equity.
Total stockholders' equity increased $1.0 million, or 1.4%, to $75.3 million at December 31, 2022 from $74.3 million at June 30, 2022. The increase
was primarily due to net income of $986,000 and earned ESOP compensation of $51,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General.
We reported net income of $341,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of $234,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $107,000, or 45.7%. The
33
increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $330,000, or 16.4%, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense of $191,000, or 10.1%, and an increase in income tax expense of $33,000.
Interest and Dividend Income.
Interest and dividend income increased $413,000, or 18.2%, to $2.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to an increase of $289,000, or 47.2%, in interest on securities, an increase of $107,000, in interest on short-term investments, and an increase of $17,000, or 1.0%, in interest on loans. Interest income on securities increased due to an increase in the average balance of securities of $33.8 million to $151.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $117.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and an increase in the average yield on securities of 26 basis points to 2.45% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 2.19% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Interest income on short-term investments increased due to an increase in the average yield of 357 basis points to 3.74% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 0.17% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of short-term investments of $24.0 million to $13.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $37.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Interest income on loans increased primarily due to an increase in the average balance of loans of $5.1 million to $177.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $172.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans of 7 basis points to 3.73% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 3.80% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the average yields on securities and other interest-earning assets resulted from the investments that were purchased during the past nine months, as interest rates increased. The increase in the average loan balances was due to originations exceeding loan payoffs. The decrease in loan yields was due to higher interest rate loan payoffs exceeding loan originations in a high interest rate environment with reduced loan demand.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense increased $83,000, or 32.3%, to $340,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $257,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit of 43 basis points, to 1.18%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 0.75% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit of $10.6 million, to $99.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $109.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit reflected the maturity of certificates of deposit before the Bank held certificates of deposit rate specials late during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Net Interest Income.
Net interest income increased $330,000, or 16.4%, to $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in average net interest-earning assets of
$14.9
million combined with an increase in our net interest rate spread of 21 basis points to 2.62% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 2.41% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our net interest margin increased 27 basis points to 2.77% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.50% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the net interest rate spread was a result of an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets exceeding the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
Provision for Loan Losses.
No provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was recorded compared to a provision for loan losses of $10,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The absence of a provision for the three months ended December 31, 2022 reflected continued strong asset quality. The allowance for loan losses was $1.7 million, or 0.97% of total loans, at December 31, 2022, compared to $1.7 million, or 1.00% of total loans, at December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses was $1.7 million, or 0.99% of total loans at June 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we had four loans totaling $1.5 million designated as special mention, as we await receipt from the borrowers of their current financials and tax returns as required by loan covenants. We had no loans categorized as substandard, doubtful or loss at December 31, 2022 or 2021. We did not have any non-performing loans at either December 31, 2022 or 2021. We had no charge-offs or recoveries for the three months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Non-interest expense increased $191,000, or 10.1%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase
was due primarily to an $83,000 increase in salaries and employee benefit expense due to normal employee annual merit salary benefit increases and the expense recognized in connection with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"), a $47,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expenses due primarily to increased lease and service contracts expenses, a $34,000 increase in advertising expense related to an employment agency fee and a $33,000 increase in other expenses due primarily to increased professional expenses.
Provision for Income Taxes.
The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $65,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, which was a $33,000, or 103.1%, increase from income taxes of $32,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our effective tax rate was 16.0% and 12.0% for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 was due to changes in the composition of tax-advantaged municipal securities and bank-owned life insurance. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to the increase in income before income taxes.

Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General.
We reported net income of $986,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of $706,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $280,000, or 39.7%. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $710,000, or 17.8%, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense of $287,000, or 8.1%, and an increase in income tax expense of $103,000, or 78.0%.
Interest and Dividend Income.
Interest and dividend income increased $757,000, or 16.7%, to $5.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $4.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to an increase of $558,000, or 46.4%, in interest on securities, and an increase of $217,000, in interest on short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease of $18,000, or 0.5%, in interest on loans. Interest income on securities increased due to an increase in the average balance of securities of $38.1 million to $150.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $112.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, and an increase in the average yield on securities of 16 basis points to 2.42% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 2.26% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Interest income on short-term investments increased due to an increase in the average yield of 270 basis points to 2.87% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from 0.17% for the six months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of cash and short-term investments of $21.7 million to $17.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $39.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Interest income on loans decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average yield earned on loans of nine basis points, to 3.70% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 3.79% for the six months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of loans of $3.4 million to $177.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $173.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the average yields on securities and other interest-earning assets resulted from the investments that were purchased during the past nine months, as interest rates increased. The increase in average loan balances was due to originations exceeding loan payoffs. The decrease in loan yields was due to higher interest rate loan payoffs exceeding loan originations in a high interest rate environment with reduced loan demand.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense increased $47,000, or 8.8%, to $582,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $535,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit of 20 basis points to 0.98% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 0.78% for the six months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit of $12.0 million, to $98.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $110.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit reflected the maturity of certificates of deposit before the Bank held certificates of deposit rate specials late during the second fiscal quarter of 2023.
Net Interest Income.
Net interest income increased $710,000, or 17.8%, to $4.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $4.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in average interest-earning assets of
$19.8
million combined with an increase in our net interest rate spread of 22 basis points to 2.63% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 2.41% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Our net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 2.76% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.50% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the net interest rate spread was a result of an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets exceeding the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
Provision for Loan Losses.
No provision for loan losses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was recorded compared to a provision for loan losses of $25,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The absence of a provision for the six months ended December 31, 2022 reflected continued strong asset quality.

was due primarily to a $147,000 increase in salaries and employee benefit expense due to normal employee annual merit salary and benefit increases and the expense recognized in connection with the ESOP, an $80,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expenses due primarily to increased lease and service contracts expenses, a $32,000 increase in advertising expense related to an employment agency fee and a $47,000 increase in other expenses due primarily to increased professional expenses.
Provision for Income Taxes.
The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $235,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a $103,000, or 78.0%, increase from income taxes of $132,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Our effective tax rate was 19.2% and 15.8% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 was due to changes in the composition of tax-advantaged municipal securities and bank-owned life insurance. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was due to the increase in income before income taxes.

Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below.

Management of Market Risk
General . The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage the impact of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and capital. We have an Asset/Liability Committee that is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. The Asset/Liability Committee establishes and monitors the amount, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals.
As part of our ongoing asset-liability management, we use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk:
• market our non-interest-bearing demand, money market, savings and demand accounts;
• diversify our loan mix;
• invest in short- to medium-term repricing and/or maturing securities whenever the market allows; and
• maintain a strong capital position.
We do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or interest rate swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities.
We consider two types of simulations impacted by changes in interest rates, which are (1) net interest income and (2) changes in the economic value of equity.
Net Interest Income Analysis.
We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model, the results of which are provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning December 31, 2022 resulting from potential changes in interest rates, expressed in basis points. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income.
Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.

Economic Value of Equity . We monitor interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model that estimates the amounts by which the fair value of our assets and liabilities (our economic value of equity or “EVE”) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The quarterly reports developed in the simulation model assist us in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling interest rate risk to ensure compliance within our policy guidelines.
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.

(1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
(2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.
(3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.
(4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2022, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 22.4% decrease in EVE, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience an 18.2% increase in EVE.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and will differ from actual results.
EVE calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity . Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities and proceeds from maturities and calls of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. At December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. At December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow $66.8 million in Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we had a $2.4 million line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, none of which was drawn at December 31, 2022.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $892,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $30,000 of net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2021. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of investment securities, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on securities, was $10.5 million and $15.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $11.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $22.4 million provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Changes in net cash related to financing activities were primarily related to changes in deposit balances for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments based on our current strategy to increase loans with an increase in core deposits as supplemented by the use of Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances as needed.
Capital Resources.
At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements. See Note 8 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements of this quarterly report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. The financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.
At December 31, 2022, we had $597,000 of commitments to originate loans, $4.1 million of unadvanced funds under home equity lines of credit, $235,000 in unadvanced funds on construction loans, and $1.0 million of unadvanced funds under commercial and other lines of credit. See Note 9 in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further information.
Contractual Obligations.
In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements and note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. As an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay the adoption of new or re-issued accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are applicable to non-public companies.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The unaudited financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.

Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations are operating in an effective manner.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
