(the “Company”)), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 24, 2014. The Company was incorporated under the name Alazzio Entertainment Corp. and changed its name to America Resources Exploration Inc. on April 17, 2015. Subsequently, on January 20, 2016, the Company changed its name to PetroGas Company. On June 12, 2015, the Company completed an acquisition of working interests in certain oil & gas properties. All share amounts in these financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this stock split.   NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN   The Company had no significant revenues from the inception through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 142,167,629 . We will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management of the Company has developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long term financing or debt financing, to enable the Company to reach profitable operations.   The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans.   NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 27, 2022.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known. The estimates on depreciation were based on the estimated useful lives of the Company’s assets. Any estimates during the period have had an immaterial effect on earnings.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents consist of commercial accounts and interest-bearing bank deposits and are carried at cost, which approximates current value. Items are considered to be cash equivalents if the original maturity is three months or less.     7 Table of Contents   Oil and Gas Properties – Full Cost Method   The Company follows the full cost accounting method to account for oil and natural gas properties, whereby costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical activities, rentals on nonproducing leases, drilling, completing and equipping of oil and gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those activities and asset retirement costs. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized to operations.   The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, excluding unevaluated and unproved properties, are amortized as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense using the units-of-production method based on estimated proved recoverable oil and gas reserves.   The costs associated with unevaluated and unproved properties, initially excluded from the amortization base, relate to unproved leasehold acreage, wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination of the existence of proved reserves, together with capitalized interest costs for these projects. Unproved leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well once a determination of the existence of proved reserves has been made or upon impairment of a lease. Costs associated with wells in progress and completed wells that have yet to be evaluated are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property. Costs of dry wells are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful.   All items classified as unproved property are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value. Properties are assessed on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; assignment of proved reserves; and economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and become subject to amortization.   Under full cost accounting rules for each cost center, capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties, including asset retirement costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount (the “cost ceiling”) equal to the sum of (a) the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves, based on current prices and operating conditions, discounted at ten percent (10%), plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less (d) any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to operations. For purposes of the ceiling test calculation, current prices are defined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. Prices are adjusted for basis or location differentials. Unless sales contracts specify otherwise, prices are held constant for the productive life of each well. Similarly, current costs are assumed to remain constant over the entire calculation period.   Revenue Recognition   Oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by the Company in oil and gas properties and royalty revenues. Sales of oil and gas produced from oil and gas operations are recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and title transfers to the purchaser. Charges for gathering and transportation are included in production expenses.   Revenue from royalties is recognized as they are earned when collection is reasonably assured. Royalty revenue is recorded in the same period as the sales that generate the royalty payment.     8 Table of Contents   Asset Retirement Obligations   The Company records a liability for asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) associated with its oil and gas wells when those assets are placed in service. The corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset and included in the carrying amount of oil and gas properties and is depleted over the useful life of the properties. Subsequently, the ARO liability is accreted to its then-present value.   Inherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:   Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.   Level 2 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.   Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information,   The carrying value of all assets and liabilities approximated their fair values as December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Earnings or Loss Per Share   In accordance with ASC Topic 280 – “Earnings Per Share”, the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.   For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net loss per shares as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive:       December 31,      December 31,
2022     2021       (Shares)     (Shares)   Convertible notes payable     21,976,778       21,976,778     Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. For the Company, the new standard was effective on January 1, 2021 and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.   Management has considered all other recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.     9 Table of Contents   NOTE 4 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS   The Company has asset retirement obligations for any wells that are permanently removed from service. The primary obligations involve the removal and disposal of surface equipment, plugging and abandoning the wells and site restoration. For the purpose of determining the fair value of ARO incurred during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company used the following assumptions.   Inflation Rate     3 % Estimated asset life   20
years   Credit adjusted risk free interest rate     18 %   As at March 31, 2016, the Company determined to fully impair its shut in wells given a lack of production over a period in excess of two years, and the uncertainty in returning the wells to production in the future. As a result, the Company has recorded a long term liability equal to the full value of the ARO.   As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, a total of $ 83,580
is recorded as asset retirement obligations, respectively   NOTE 5 – PROMISSORY NOTE – RELATED PARTY   On December 31, 2016, the Company entered into a promissory note with a majority shareholder, Rise Fast Limited, for an amount of $ 240,683 . The promissory note bears interest at a rate of

Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.

As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “our company” means PetroGas Company, unless otherwise indicated.   Corporate Overview   We were incorporated under the name Alazzio Entertainment Corp. on January 24, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our original business plan was to operate photo booth rentals.   On April 3, 2015, a change in control occurred by virtue of our company’s largest shareholder, Dmitri Kapsumun selling 900,000 shares (split adjusted) of our common stock to Rise Fast Limited, a Hong Kong corporation. Such shares represented 71.77% of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares, Rise Fast Limited arranged with the resigning member of our company’s Board of Directors, to appoint Mr. Huang Yu as the sole officer and director of our company.   On April 16, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Nevada SOS”) whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by increasing our authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 300 million (not adjusted for the one (1) for one hundred (100) stock split) and increasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of fifteen (15) shares for every one (1) share held. Our Board of Directors approved this amendment on April 15, 2015 and shareholders holding 71.77% of our issued and outstanding shares approved this amendment via a written consent executed on April 16, 2015.   Effective April 29, 2015 we changed our name to America Resources Exploration Inc. by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated solely for the purpose of the change of name.   On June 10, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Zheng Xiangwu, a resident of Guang Dong Province, China, whereby we issued 40,000 million shares of its common stock in exchange for rights to certain oil and gas leases located in Frio and Atascosa Counties, Texas, consisting of a total of 714 total acres of land, two (2) working wells and a total of seven (7) wells (the “Leases”). The acquisition of the Leases pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement was completed on June 1, 2015. As a result of the completion of this acquisition, 40,000 shares of our company’s common stock were issued to Mr. Zheng Xiangwu, who owns our company’s largest shareholder, Rise Fast Limited. The number of shares issued to Mr. Zheng was determined by valuing the Leases at $160,000 and valuing our company’s stock at $0.04 per share. At the completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the oil and gas industry.     13 Table of Contents   On June 11, 2015, we entered into various assignment agreements with Mr. Zheng for the acquisition of multiple oil and gas leases and overriding royalty interests (“ORR’s”) as set out in the table below. From July 6, 2015 through July 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of such oil and gas leases and ORR’s, whereby we issued a total of 6,500 shares of our common stock to Mr. Zheng.   Assignment Date Name of The Property Type of Property Location         June 11 th , 2015 Ellis County Overriding Royalty Int.

Texas June 11 th , 2015 Madison County Wellbore Interest Texas June 11 th , 2015 Shelby County Wellbore Interest Texas June 11 th , 2015 Emergy County Lease Purchase Utah   On August 13, 2015 we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Inceptus Resources, LLC whereby our company acquired a 78% net revenue interest in 200 acres located in Callahan County, Texas, and a 78% net revenue interest in 522 acres also located in Callahan County, Texas.   On January 20, 2016, we changed our name to PetroGas Company, by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated solely for the purpose of the change of name. In addition, we amended our Articles of Incorporation for a reverse stock split by decreasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio one (1) new for one hundred (100) old shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was approved by our directors and shareholders holding 68.65% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on January 13, 2016 and the reverse stock split became effective with FINRA on March 7, 2016. The change of name resulted in a change of trading symbol to “PTCO”.   On September 13, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by decreasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held. Our Board of Directors approved the Amendment on July 21, 2017 and Shareholders holding 75.95% of our company’s shares approved the Amendment via written consent executed on July 21, 2017, with an effective date of October 5, 2017.   On February 20, 2019 a majority of our shareholders and our board of directors approved a resolution to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a one (1) new for 100 old basis. The reverse split was approved by FINRA with an effective date of March 19, 2019. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreased from 30,099,230 to 300,993 shares of common stock. Our authorized capital remained unchanged.   Our principal executive offices are located at 2800 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 4100, Houston, Texas 77056. Our telephone number is (832) 899-8597.   We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.   We hold a 94% interest in Seabourn Oil Company, LLC, a Texas LLC.   CURRENT INVESTMENTS   On June 12, 2015, we acquired three (3) producing leases covering 714 acres situated in Atascosa and Frio Counties, Texas, located in the Eagle Ford Shale formation - the Jane Burns “C” (“Burns”), the Theo Rogers “C”, and the Theo Rogers “A” & “D” (“Rogers”) Leases. We acquired a 99.5% working interest (74.625% net revenue interest) in each lease.     14 Table of Contents   The Burns and Rogers Leases provide exploration and production opportunities in the Kyote Field pay zone, very near the Eagle Ford Shale play with access to available rig crews and other vendor-servicers, due to their close proximity to San Antonio, Texas.   The Burns and Rogers Leases hold collectively seven (7) oil wells, but none of which are operating wells. Although our company’s management and industry professionals believed at the time that they were acquired that our company could double or triple previous production on these wells, depressed oil prices indicate that the cost to bring these wells online an uneconomical venture.   On November 30, 2016, we acquired various royalty interests in Texas for $10,485. On December 14, 2016, we acquired two oil and gas leases in Ohio for $2,705. On January 1, 2017, our company acquired the lease for three oil and gas properties for $4,975.   Future Operations   We are actively seeking to acquire producing and non-producing leases that will allow us to explore and drill in high-profile pay zones.   We intend to raise capital at a low cost from private placements so that we may acquire numerous additional leases, and to commence drilling, and taking advantage of the inevitable uptick in oil prices to come.   In the current climate, our company believes that there are a very large number of oil & gas leases under distress due to the depressed gas prices and that we can strategically position our company to acquire as many of these leases as possible at a discount to market value, hence creating shareholder value.   We are planning an exploration strategy to drill new wells on the current Leases, as well as acquire deeper rights in order to drill some of the wells at great depths. We expect that reservoirs at those depths could yield a very high daily output of oil.   Results of Operations   We have earned limited royalty revenues since inception.   Three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to three months ended December 31, 2021       Three Months     Three Months             Ended     Ended             December 31,     December 31,             2022     2021     Changes                       Operating Expenses   $ 4,750     $ 5,525     $ (775 ) Other Expenses
