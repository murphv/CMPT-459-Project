Equity investments are non-income producing, unless otherwise noted. 2 All of the Company’s investments and the investments of SBIC I (as defined below), unless otherwise noted, are pledged as collateral for the Company’s senior secured credit facility or in support of the SBA-guaranteed debentures to be issued by Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP, our wholly-owned subsidiary that operates as a small business investment company ("SBIC I"), respectively. 3 The majority of investments bear interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR” or “L”),
or Prime (“P”) and reset daily (D), monthly (M), quarterly (Q), or semiannually (S).
For each investment, the Company has provided the spread over SOFR, LIBOR or Prime and the current contractual interest rate in effect at December 31, 2022.
Certain investments are subject to an interest rate floor. Certain investments, as noted, accrue payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest. 4 The Company's investment portfolio is comprised entirely of debt and equity securities of privately held companies for which quoted prices falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are not readily available. Therefore, the Company values all of its portfolio investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, using significant unobservable Level 3 inputs. Refer to Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements for further discussion. 5 Non-Control/Non-Affiliate investments are generally defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as investments that are neither control investments nor affiliate investments. At December 31, 2022, approximately
80.8 % of the Company’s investment assets were non-control/non-affiliate investments. The fair value of these investments as a percent of net assets is
165.4 %. 6 Affiliate investments are generally defined by the 1940 Act as investments in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned and the investments are not classified as control investments. At December 31, 2022, approximately
15.1 % of the Company’s investment assets were affiliate investments. The fair value of these investments as a percent of net assets is
30.9 %. 21 Table of Contents 7 Control investments are generally defined by the 1940 Act as investments in which more than 25% of the voting securities are owned. At December 31, 2022, approximately
4.1 % of the Company’s investment assets were control investments. The fair value of these investments as a percent of net assets is
8.5 %. 8 The investment is structured as a first lien last out term loan. 9 Indicates assets that are not considered "qualifying assets" under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act.
Qualifying assets must represent at least 70% of total assets at the time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. As of December 31, 2022, approximately
13.5 % of the Company's assets were non-qualifying assets. 10 The investment has an unfunded commitment as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. 11 Income producing through dividends or distributions. 12 As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative gross unrealized appreciation for U.S. federal income tax purposes was approximately $ 66.9
million; cumulative gross unrealized depreciation for federal income tax purposes was $ 66.7
million.
Cumulative net unrealized appreciation was $ 0.2
million, based on a tax cost of $ 1,150.6
million. 13 Investment is held through a wholly-owned taxable subsidiary. 14 The Company generally acquires its investments in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). These investments, which as of December 31, 2022 represented
204.8 % of the Company's net assets or
95.7 % of the Company's total assets, are generally subject to certain limitations on resale, and may be deemed "restricted securities" under the Securities Act. 15 The investment is structured as a split lien term loan, which provides the Company with a first lien priority on certain assets of the obligor and a second lien priority on different assets of the obligor. 16 Investment is on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2022, meaning the Company has ceased to recognize interest income on the investment. 17 Negative cost in this column represents the original issue discount of certain undrawn revolvers and delayed draw term loans. 18 Equity ownership may be held in shares or units of a company that is either wholly owned by the portfolio company or under common control by the same parent company to the portfolio company. 19 The investment is structured as a first lien first out term loan. A brief description of the portfolio company in which we made an investment that represents greater than 5% of our total assets as of December 31, 2022 is included in Note 13 - Significant Subsidiaries.

Equity investments and warrants are non-income producing, unless otherwise noted. 2 All of the Company’s investments and the investments of SBIC I (as defined below), unless otherwise noted, are pledged as collateral for the Company’s senior secured credit facility or in support of the SBA-guaranteed debentures to be issued by Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP, our wholly-owned subsidiary that operates as a small business investment company ("SBIC I"), respectively. 3 The majority of investments bear interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR” or “L”), Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or Prime (“P”) and reset daily (D), monthly (M), quarterly (Q), or semiannually (S). For each investment, the Company has provided the spread over LIBOR, SOFR or Prime and the current contractual interest rate in effect at March 31, 2022. Certain investments are subject to an interest rate floor. Certain investments, as noted, accrue payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest. 4 The Company's investment portfolio is comprised entirely of debt and equity securities of privately held companies for which quoted prices falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are not readily available. Therefore, the Company values all of its portfolio investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, using significant unobservable Level 3 inputs. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion. 34 Table of Contents 5 Non-Control/Non-Affiliate investments are generally defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as investments that are neither control investments nor affiliate investments. At March 31, 2022, approximately
79.8 % of the Company’s investment assets were non-control/non-affiliate investments. The fair value of these investments as a percent of net assets is
177.5 %. 6 Affiliate investments are generally defined by the 1940 Act as investments in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned and the investments are not classified as control investments. At March 31, 2022, approximately
14.1 % of the Company’s investment assets were affiliate investments. The fair value of these investments as a percent of net assets is
31.3 %. 7 Control investments are generally defined by the 1940 Act as investments in which more than 25% of the voting securities are owned. At March 31, 2022, approximately
6.2 % of the Company’s investment assets were control investments. The fair value of these investments as a percent of net assets is
13.7 %. 8 The investment is structured as a first lien last out term loan. 9 Indicates assets that are considered "non-qualifying assets” under section 55(a) of the 1940 Act.
Qualifying assets must represent at least 70% of total assets at the time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. As of March 31, 2022, approximately
12.8 % of the Company's assets are non-qualifying assets. 10 The investment has an unfunded commitment as of March 31, 2022. Refer to Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. 11 Income producing through dividends or distributions. 12 As of March 31, 2022, the cumulative gross unrealized appreciation for U.S. federal income tax purposes is approximately $ 67.8  million; cumulative gross unrealized depreciation for federal income tax purposes is $ 61.7  million.
Cumulative net unrealized appreciation is $ 6.1  million, based on a tax cost of $ 852.4  million. 13 Investment is held through a wholly-owned taxable subsidiary. 14 The Company generally acquires its investments in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). These investments, which as of March 31, 2022 represented
222.5 % of the Company's net assets or
96.2 % of the Company's total assets, are generally subject to certain limitations on resale, and may be deemed "restricted securities" under the Securities Act. 15 The investment is structured as a split lien term loan, which provides the Company with a first lien priority on certain assets of the obligor and a second lien priority on different assets of the obligor. 16 Investment is on non-accrual status as of March 31, 2022, meaning the Company has ceased to recognize interest income on the investment. 17 Represents amortized cost. Negative cost in this column represents the original issue discount of certain undrawn revolvers and delayed draw term loans. 18 Equity ownership may be held in shares or units of a company that is either wholly owned by the portfolio company or under common control by the same parent company to the portfolio company. A brief description of the portfolio company in which we made an investment that represents greater than 5% of our total assets as of March 31, 2022 is included in Note 13. Significant Subsidiaries. The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.     ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION     References in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to “we,” “our,” “us,” “CSWC,” or the “Company” refer to Capital Southwest Corporation, unless the context requires otherwise. Organization Capital Southwest Corporation is an internally managed investment company that specializes in providing customized financing to middle market companies in a broad range of investment segments located primarily in the United States. Our common stock currently trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “CSWC.”
CSWC was organized as a Texas corporation on April 19, 1961. On March 30, 1988, CSWC elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the 1940 Act. In order to comply with the 1940 Act requirements for a BDC, we must, among other things, generally invest at least 70% of our assets in eligible portfolio companies and limit the amount of leverage we incur.
We have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, we generally will not have to pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders as dividends. To continue to maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute annually at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year that generated such taxable income.
CSWC has a direct wholly-owned subsidiary that has been elected to be a taxable entity (the “Taxable Subsidiary”). The primary purpose of the Taxable Subsidiary is to permit CSWC to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities), and still allow us to satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90% of our gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. The Taxable Subsidiary is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income. We focus on investing in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow, established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline. Our core business is to target senior debt investments and equity investments in lower middle market (“LMM”) companies. We also opportunistically target first and second lien loans in upper middle market (“UMM”) companies. Our target LMM companies typically have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) generally between $ 3.0  million and $ 20.0  million, and our LMM investments generally range in size from $ 5.0  million to $ 35.0  million. Our UMM investments generally include first and second lien loans in companies with EBITDA generally greater than $ 20.0  million and typically range in size from $ 5.0  million to $ 20.0  million. We make available significant managerial assistance to the companies in which we invest as we believe that providing managerial assistance to an investee company is critical to its business development activities. On April 20, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP (“SBIC I”) received a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) to operate as a small business investment company ("SBIC") under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. SBIC I has an investment strategy substantially similar to ours and makes similar types of investments in accordance with SBA regulations. SBIC I and its general partner are consolidated for financial reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), and the portfolio investments held by it are included in the consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
We meet the definition of an investment company and follow the accounting and reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946 –
Financial Services – Investment Companies
(“ASC 946”) .
Under rules and regulations applicable to investment companies, we are generally precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company, subject to certain exceptions.
One of the exceptions to this general principle occurs if the investment company has an investment in an operating company that provides services to the investment company.
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements include the Taxable Subsidiary.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of our management, the unaudited consolidated financial results included herein contain all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of consolidated financial statements for the interim periods included herein. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year. Also, the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Consolidated financial statements prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. Portfolio Investment Classification We classify our investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act.
Under the 1940 Act, “Control Investments” are generally defined as investments in which we own more than 25% of the voting securities; “Affiliate Investments” are generally defined as investments in which we own between 5% and 25% of the voting securities, and the investments are not classified as “Control Investments”; and “Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments” are generally defined as investments that are neither “Control Investments” nor “Affiliate Investments.” Under the 1940 Act, a BDC must meet certain requirements, including investing at least 70% of its total assets in qualifying assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has
86.5 % of its assets in qualifying assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are: (1) securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an "eligible portfolio company," or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"); (2) securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control; (3) securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements; (4) securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no readily available market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company; (5) securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities; and (6) cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 37 Table of Contents Additionally,
in order to qualify for RIC tax treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things meet the following requirements: (1)
continue to maintain our election as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; (2)
derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain "qualified publicly traded partnerships," or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities; and (3)
diversify our holdings in accordance with two diversification requirements: (a) diversify our holdings such that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and such other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
(b) diversify our holdings such that no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer, (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of certain "qualified publicly traded partnerships" (collectively, the "Diversification Requirements");
The two Diversification Requirements must be satisfied quarterly. If a RIC satisfies the Diversification Requirements for one quarter, and then, due solely to fluctuations in market value, fails to meet one of the Diversification Requirements in the next quarter, it retains RIC tax treatment. A RIC that fails to meet the Diversification Requirements as a result of a nonqualified acquisition may be subject to excess taxes unless the nonqualified acquisition is disposed of and the Diversification Requirements are satisfied within 30 days of the close of the quarter in which the Diversification Requirements are failed. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we satisfied all RIC requirements and have
11.2 % in nonqualified assets according to measurement criteria established in Section 851(d) of the Code. 2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of CSWC. Fair Value Measurements
We account for substantially all of our financial instruments at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 –
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements, including the categorization of financial instruments into a three-level hierarchy based on the transparency of valuation inputs. ASC 820 requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate such value.
We believe that the carrying amounts of our financial instruments such as cash, receivables and payables approximate the fair value of these items due to the short maturity of these instruments. This is considered a Level 1 valuation technique. The carrying value of our credit facility approximates fair value (Level 3 input). See Note 4 below for further discussion regarding the fair value measurements and hierarchy. Investments
Investments are stated at fair value and are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Schedule of Investments and Notes 3 and 4 below. Investments are recorded on a trade date basis. Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation
Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of an investment or a financial instrument and the cost basis of the investment or financial instrument, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period net of recoveries and realized gains or losses from in-kind redemptions. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the net change in the fair value of the investment portfolio and financial instruments and the reclassification of any prior period unrealized appreciation or depreciation on exited investments and financial instruments to realized gains or losses. 38 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents, which consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash may be held in a money market fund from time to time, which is a Level 1 security. Cash and cash equivalents includes deposits at financial institutions. We deposit our cash balances in financial institutions and, at times, such balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, cash balances totaling $ 20.4
million and $ 10.2
million, respectively, exceeded FDIC insurance limits, subjecting us to risk related to the uninsured balance. All of our cash deposits are held at large established high credit quality financial institutions and management believes that the risk of loss associated with any uninsured balances is remote. Segment Information
We operate and manage our business in a singular segment. As an investment company, we invest in portfolio companies in various industries and geographic areas as discussed in Note 3. Consolidation
As permitted under Regulation S-X and ASC 946, we generally do not consolidate our investment in a portfolio company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to CSWC. Accordingly, we consolidate the results of the Taxable Subsidiary and SBIC I. All intercompany balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. Interest and Dividend Income
Interest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Discounts/premiums received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted or amortized into income over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. In accordance with our valuation policy, accrued interest and dividend income is evaluated quarterly for collectability. When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt security’s status significantly improves regarding its ability to service debt or other obligations, it will be restored to accrual basis. As of December 31, 2022, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately
0.3 % of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately
1.4 % of its cost. As of March 31, 2022, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately
1.5 % of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately
2.6 % of its cost.
To maintain RIC tax treatment, non-cash sources of income such as accretion of interest income may need to be paid out to shareholders in the form of distributions, even though CSWC may not have collected the interest income.
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately
3.2 % and
3.5 %, respectively, of CSWC's total investment income was attributable to non-cash interest income for the accretion of discounts associated with debt investments, net of any premium reduction. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, approximately
3.4 % and
3.6 %, respectively, of CSWC's total investment income was attributable to non-cash interest income for the accretion of discounts associated with debt investments, net of any premium reduction. Payment-in-Kind Interest
The Company currently holds, and expects to hold in the future, some investments in its portfolio that contain PIK interest provisions. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is added to the principal balance of the loan, rather than being paid to the Company in cash, and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income, is included in the Company’s taxable income and therefore affects the amount the Company is required to distribute to shareholders to maintain its qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. Generally, when current cash interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if the Company otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Company will place the investment on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing PIK interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Company writes off any accrued and uncollected PIK interest when it is determined that the PIK interest is no longer
39 Table of Contents collectible.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we have not written off any accrued and uncollected PIK interest from prior periods. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we had
three
investments for which we stopped accruing PIK interest. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we had
two
investments for which we stopped accruing PIK interest. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately
4.6 % and
4.4 %, respectively, of CSWC’s total investment income was attributable to non-cash PIK interest income. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, approximately
3.6 % and
4.4 %, respectively, of CSWC’s total investment income was attributable to non-cash PIK interest income. Fee Income
Fee income, generally collected in advance, includes fees for administration and valuation services rendered by the Company. These fees are typically charged annually and are amortized into income over the year. The Company recognizes nonrecurring fees, including prepayment penalties, waiver fees and amendment fees, as fee income when earned. In addition, the Company may also be entitled to an exit fee that is amortized into income over the life of the loan. Loan exit fees to be paid at the termination of the loan are accreted into fee income over the contractual life of the loan.
Warrants
In connection with the Company's debt investments, the Company may receive warrants or other equity-related securities from the borrower. The Company determines the cost basis of warrants based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value of the debt and warrants received. Any resulting difference between the face amount of the debt and its recorded fair value resulting from the assignment of value to the warrants is treated as original issue discount (“OID”), and accreted into interest income using the effective interest method over the term of the debt investment. Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs include commitment fees and other costs related to CSWC’s senior secured credit facility, its unsecured notes (as discussed further in Note 5) and the debentures guaranteed by the SBA (the "SBA Debentures"). The costs in connection with the credit facility have been capitalized and are amortized into interest expense over the term of the credit facility. The costs in connection with the unsecured notes and the SBA Debentures are a direct deduction from the related debt liability and amortized into interest expense over the term of the January 2026 Notes (as defined below), the October 2026 Notes (as defined below) and the SBA Debentures. Deferred Offering Costs
Deferred offering costs include registration expenses related to our shelf registration statement and expenses related to the launch of the "at-the-market" ("ATM") program through which we can sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock (the "Equity ATM Program"). These expenses consist primarily of SEC registration fees, legal fees and accounting fees incurred related thereto. These expenses are included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Upon the completion of an equity offering or a debt offering, the deferred expenses are charged to additional paid-in capital or debt issuance costs, respectively. If there are any deferred offering costs remaining at the expiration of the shelf registration statement, these deferred costs are charged to expense. Realized Losses on Extinguishment of Debt
Upon the repayment of debt obligations that are deemed to be extinguishments, the difference between the principal amount due at maturity adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs is recognized as a loss (i.e., the unamortized debt issuance costs and any "make-whole" premium payment (as discussed in Note 5)) are recognized as a loss upon extinguishment of the underlying debt obligation).
Leases
The Company is obligated under an operating lease pursuant to which it is leasing an office facility from a third party with a remaining term of approximately 10 years. The operating lease is included as an operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") asset and operating lease liability in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The Company does not have any financing leases. The ROU asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the operating lease liability represents the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from such lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company’s lease does not provide an implicit discount rate, and as such the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the remaining lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.
Federal Income Taxes
CSWC has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subsection M of the Code. By meeting these requirements, we will not be subject to U.S.
40 Table of Contents federal income taxes at corporate rates on ordinary income or capital gains timely distributed to shareholders. In order to qualify as a RIC, the Company is required to timely distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, each year. Investment company taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses.
Investment company taxable income generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains and losses are not included in investment company taxable income until they are realized.
Depending on the level of taxable income or capital gains earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income or capital gains in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such income. Any such carryover taxable income or capital gains must be distributed through a dividend declared on or prior to the later of (1) the filing of the U.S. federal income tax return for the applicable fiscal year and (2) the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the year in which such taxable income was generated.
In lieu of distributing our net capital gains for a year, we may decide to retain some or all of our net capital gains. We will be required to pay a 21% corporate rate U.S. federal income tax on any such retained net capital gains. We may elect to treat such retained capital gain as a deemed distribution to shareholders. Under such circumstances, shareholders will be required to include their share of such retained capital gain in income, but will receive a credit for the amount of U.S. federal income tax paid at corporate rates with respect to their shares. As an investment company that qualifies as a RIC, federal income taxes payable on security gains that we elect to retain are accrued only on the last day of our tax year, December 31. Any net capital gains actually distributed to shareholders and properly reported by us as capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholders as long-term capital gains. See Note 6 for further discussion. The Taxable Subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSWC, is not a RIC and is required to pay taxes at the corporate rate of 21%. For tax purposes, the Taxable Subsidiary has elected to be treated as a taxable entity, and therefore is not consolidated for tax purposes and is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on taxable income and, as a result of its activities, may generate an income tax provision or benefit. The taxable income, or loss, of the Taxable Subsidiary may differ from its book income, or loss, due to temporary book and tax timing differences and permanent differences. This income tax provision, or benefit, if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
Management evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions with respect to tax at the CSWC level not deemed to meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold would be recorded as an expense in the current year. Management’s conclusions regarding tax positions will be subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company has concluded that it does not have any uncertain tax positions that meet the recognition of measurement criteria of ASC 740,
Income Taxes , ("ASC 740") for the current period. Also, we account for interest and, if applicable, penalties for any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax provision.
No
interest or penalties expense was recorded during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for losses or income at our taxable subsidiaries using statutory tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. ASC 740 requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation was enacted. See Note 6 for further discussion. Stock-Based Compensation
We account for our share-based compensation using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC Topic 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation . Accordingly, we recognize share-based compensation cost on a straight-line basis for all share-based payments awards granted to employees.
For restricted stock awards, we measure the fair value based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant. For restricted stock awards, we amortize this fair value to share-based compensation expense over the vesting term. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. The unvested shares of restricted stock awarded pursuant to CSWC’s equity compensation plans are participating securities and are included in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation.
41 Table of Contents The right to grant restricted stock awards under the 2010 Plan terminated on July 18, 2021,
ten years
after the date that the 2010 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the “2010 Plan”) was approved by the Company’s shareholders pursuant to its terms. In connection with the termination of the 2010 Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors and shareholders approved the Capital Southwest Corporation 2021 Employee Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "2021 Employee Plan"), which became effective on July 28, 2021, as part of the compensation package for its employees, the terms of which are, in all material respects, identical to the 2010 Plan. On July 19, 2021, we received an exemptive order that supersedes the prior exemptive order relating to the 2010 Plan (the “Order”) to permit the Company to (i) issue restricted stock as part of the compensation package for its employees in the 2021 Employee Plan, and (ii) withhold shares of the Company’s common stock or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock from the participants to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of restricted stock pursuant to the 2021 Employee Plan. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors and shareholders approved the Capital Southwest Corporation 2021 Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan (the "Non-Employee Director Plan"), which became effective on July 27, 2022, as part of the compensation package for non-employee directors of the Board of Directors. In connection therewith, on May 16, 2022, we received an exemptive order that supersedes the Order (the "Superseding Order") and covers both employees and non-employee directors of the Board of Directors.
Shareholder Distributions
Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount of distributions, if any, is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, generally are distributed, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment. Presentation
Presentation of certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for the prior year comparative consolidated financial statements is updated to conform to the current period presentation.
Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference rate reform (Topic 848)—Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting." The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to certain contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform and became effective upon issuance for all entities. The Company has agreements that have LIBOR as a reference rate with certain portfolio companies and certain lenders. Many of these agreements include an alternative successor rate or language for choosing an alternative successor rate when LIBOR reference is no longer considered to be appropriate. With respect to other agreements, the Company intends to work with its portfolio companies and certain lenders to modify agreements to choose an alternative successor rate. Contract modifications are required to be evaluated in determining whether the modifications result in the establishment of new contracts or the continuation of existing contracts. On December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 "Reference rate reform (Topic 848)—Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848," which defers the sunset date of ASC 848 until December 31, 2024. ASU 2022-06 became effective upon issuance. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024, except for hedging transactions as of December 31, 2024, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The Company does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or its disclosure and did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,” which was issued to (1) clarify the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, (2) amend a related illustrative example, and (3) introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or its disclosure.

These loans may, in certain cases, be subordinated in payment priority to other senior secured lenders. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of the first lien last out loans are $ 51.0
million and $ 38.6
million, respectively. 2 Included in first lien loans and second lien loans are loans structured as split lien term loans. These loans provide the Company with a first lien priority on certain assets of the obligor and a second lien priority on different assets of the obligor. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of the split lien term loans included in first lien loans is $ 37.2
million and $ 36.4
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of the split lien term loans included in second lien loans is $ 20.6
million and $ 33.9
million, respectively. 3 Included in subordinated debt are unsecured convertible notes with a fair value of $ 0.5
million and $ 0.7
million as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. 4 I-45 SLF LLC is a joint venture between CSWC and Main Street Capital Corporation. This entity primarily invests in syndicated senior secured loans to the UMM. The portfolio companies held by I-45 SLF LLC represent a diverse set of industry classifications, which are similar to those in which CSWC invests directly.

See Note 13 for further discussion. 46 Table of Contents 4.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Investment Valuation Process The valuation process is led by the finance department in conjunction with the investment team. The process includes a quarterly review of each investment by our executive officers and investment team. Valuations of each portfolio security are prepared quarterly by the finance department using updated financial and other operational information collected by the investment team. Each investment valuation is then subject to review by the executive officers and investment team. In conjunction with the internal valuation process, we have also engaged multiple independent consulting firms specializing in financial due diligence, valuation, and business advisory services to provide third-party valuation reviews of certain investments. The third-party valuation firms provide a range of values for selected investments, which is presented to CSWC’s executive officers and then subsequently to the Board of Directors. CSWC also uses a standard internal investment rating system in connection with its investment oversight, portfolio management, and investment valuation procedures for its debt portfolio. This system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio company and the investments held therein. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith, as fair value depends upon the specific circumstances of each individual investment. While management believes our valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with market participants, the recorded fair values of our investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. The Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for reviewing and determining, in good faith, the fair value of CSWC’s investments in accordance with the 1940 Act. Fair Value Hierarchy CSWC has established and documented processes for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC 820.
As
required by ASC 820, when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Therefore, unrealized appreciation and depreciation related to such investments categorized within the Level 3 tables below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3). CSWC conducts reviews of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. We also use judgment and consider factors specific to the investment in determining the significance of an input to a fair value measurement.
The three levels of valuation inputs established by ASC 820 are as follows: • Level 1:
Investments whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2:
Investments whose values are based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3:
Investments whose values are based on unobservable inputs that are significant to the overall fair value measurement.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022,
100 % of the CSWC investment portfolio consisted of privately held debt and equity instruments for which inputs falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 are generally not readily available. Therefore, CSWC determines the fair value of its investments (excluding investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value ("NAV") in good faith using Level 3 inputs, pursuant to CSWC's valuation policy and procedures that are established by the management of CSWC, with assistance from multiple third-party valuation advisors and approved by our Board of Directors. 47 Table of Contents Investment Valuation Inputs ASC 820 defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date excluding transaction costs. Under ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset. The principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset or liability under ASC 820, it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to the market as of the measurement date.
The Level 3 inputs to CSWC’s valuation process reflect our best estimate of the assumptions that would be used by market participants in pricing the investment in a transaction in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset.
The fair value determination of each portfolio investment categorized as Level 3 required one or more of the following unobservable inputs: • Financial information obtained from each portfolio company, including unaudited statements of operations and balance sheets for the most recent period available as compared to budgeted numbers; • Current and projected financial condition of the portfolio company; • Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations; • Type and amount of collateral, if any, underlying the investment; • Current financial ratios (e.g., fixed charge coverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and net debt/EBITDA ratio) applicable to the investment; • Current liquidity of the investment and related financial ratios (e.g., current ratio and quick ratio); • Indicative dealer quotations from brokers, banks, and other market participants; • Market yields on other securities of similar risk; • Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company; • Projected operating results of the portfolio company;
• Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment; • Current ability of the portfolio company to raise any additional financing as needed; • Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company; • Internal occurrences that may have an impact (both positive and negative) on the operating performance of the portfolio company; • Qualitative assessment of key management; • Contractual rights, obligations or restrictions associated with the investment; and • Other factors deemed relevant. CSWC uses several different valuation approaches depending on the security type including the Market Approach, the Income Approach, the Enterprise Value Waterfall Approach, and the NAV Valuation Method.
Market Approach Market Approach is a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the aforementioned unobservable inputs. It is a combination of the Enterprise Value Waterfall Approach and Income Approach as described in detail below. For investments recently originated (within a quarterly reporting period) or where the value has not departed significantly from its cost, we generally rely on our cost basis or recent transaction price to determine the fair value, unless a material event has occurred since origination.
Income Approach In valuing debt securities, CSWC typically uses an Income Approach model, which considers some or all of the factors listed above. Under the Income Approach, CSWC develops an expectation of the yield that a hypothetical market participant would require when purchasing each debt investment (the “Required Market Yield”). The Required Market Yield is calculated in a two-step process. First, using quarterly market data we estimate the current market yield of similar debt securities. Next,
48 Table of Contents based on the factors described above, we modify the current market yield for each security to produce a unique Required Market Yield for each of our investments. The resulting Required Market Yield is the significant Level 3 input to the Income Approach model. If, with respect to an investment, the unobservable inputs have not fluctuated significantly from the date the investment was made or have not fluctuated significantly from CSWC’s expectations on the date the investment was made, and there have been no significant fluctuations in the market pricing for such investments, we may conclude that the Required Market Yield for that investment is equal to the stated rate on the investment. In instances where CSWC determines that the Required Market Yield is different from the stated rate on the investment, we discount the contractual cash flows on the debt instrument using the Required Market Yield in order to estimate the fair value of the debt security.
In addition, under the Income Approach, CSWC also determines the appropriateness of the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, as a significant Level 3 input in determining fair value. In determining the appropriateness of the use of third-party broker quotes, CSWC evaluates the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote, whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer, the depth and consistency of broker quotes, the source of the broker quotes, and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance of the portfolio company and other market indices. To the extent sufficient observable inputs are available to determine fair value, CSWC may use third-party broker quotes or other independent pricing to determine the fair value of certain debt investments. Fair value measurements using the Income Approach model can be sensitive to significant changes in one or more of the inputs. A significant increase (decrease) in the Required Market Yield for a particular debt security may result in a lower (higher) fair value for that security. A significant increase (decrease) in a third-party broker quote for a particular debt security may result in a higher (lower) value for that security.
Enterprise Value Waterfall Approach
In valuing equity securities (including warrants), CSWC estimates fair value using an Enterprise Value Waterfall valuation model. CSWC estimates the enterprise value of a portfolio company and then allocates the enterprise value to the portfolio company’s securities in order of their relative liquidation preference. In addition, CSWC assumes that any outstanding debt or other securities that are senior to CSWC’s equity securities are required to be repaid at par. Additionally, we may estimate the fair value of non-performing debt securities using the Enterprise Value Waterfall approach as needed.
To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, CSWC uses a weighted valuation model based on public comparable companies, observable transactions and discounted cash flow analyses. A main input into the valuation model is a measure of the portfolio company’s financial performance, which generally is either earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”) or revenues. In addition, we consider other factors, including but not limited to (1) offers from third parties to purchase the portfolio company and (2) the implied value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company. For certain non-performing assets, we may utilize the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets in our estimation of its enterprise value.
The significant Level 3 inputs to the Enterprise Value Waterfall model are (1) an appropriate multiple derived from the comparable public companies and transactions, (2) discount rate assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model and (3) a measure of the portfolio company’s financial performance, which generally is either Adjusted EBITDA or revenues. Inputs can be based on historical operating results, projections of future operating results or a combination thereof. The operating results of a portfolio company may be unaudited, projected or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for certain non-recurring items. CSWC also may consult with the portfolio company’s senior management to obtain updates on the portfolio company’s performance, including information such as industry trends, new product development, loss of customers and other operational issues. Fair value measurements using the Enterprise Value Waterfall model can be sensitive to significant changes in one or more of the inputs. A significant increase (decrease) in either the multiple, Adjusted EBITDA or revenues for a particular equity security would result in a higher (lower) fair value for that security.
NAV Valuation Method Under the NAV valuation method, for an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, CSWC measures the fair value of the investment predominately based on the NAV of the investment fund as of the measurement date. However, in determining the fair value of the investment, we may consider whether adjustments to the NAV are necessary in certain circumstances, based on the analysis of any restrictions on redemption of our investment as of the measurement date, recent actual sales or redemptions of interests in the investment fund, expected future cash flows available to equity holders, or other uncertainties surrounding CSWC’s ability to realize the full NAV of its interests in the investment fund. 49 Table of Contents The following fair value hierarchy tables set forth our investment portfolio by level as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2022 Using Asset Category Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs

During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no transfers between levels. 52 Table of Contents The following tables provide a summary of changes in the fair value of investments measured using Level 3 inputs during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Fair Value March 31, 2022 Realized & Unrealized Gains (Losses) Purchases of Investments 1 Repayments PIK Interest Capitalized Divestitures Conversion/Reclassification of Security Fair Value December 31, 2022 YTD Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments held at period end First lien loans $ 739,872   $ ( 14,263 ) $ 335,069   $ ( 96,475 ) $ 3,512   $ —   $ ( 13,715 ) $ 954,000   $ ( 10,201 ) Second lien loans 52,645   ( 7,512 ) 2,930   ( 12,239 ) 314   ( 692 ) —   35,446   ( 6,307 ) Subordinated debt 1,317   ( 328 ) 385   —   65   —   ( 587 ) 852   ( 224 ) Preferred equity 44,663   ( 1,253 ) 3,571   —   —   —   14,302   61,283   1,840   Common equity & warrants 40,514   8,670   4,320   —   —   ( 2,664 ) —   50,840   9,853   Total Investments $ 879,011   $ ( 14,686 ) $ 346,275   $ ( 108,714 ) $ 3,891   $ ( 3,356 ) $ —   $ 1,102,421   $ ( 5,039 ) Fair Value March 31, 2021 Realized & Unrealized Gains (Losses) Purchases of Investments 1 Repayments PIK Interest Capitalized Divestitures Conversion/Reclassification of Security Fair Value December 31, 2021 YTD Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments held at period end First lien loans $ 524,161   $ ( 998 ) $ 378,164   $ ( 219,454 ) $ 1,994   $ —   $ ( 4,683 ) $ 679,184   $ ( 2,515 ) Second lien loans 36,919   ( 1,791 ) 18,841   ( 7,152 ) 1,079   ( 53 ) 5,208   53,051   ( 2,165 ) Subordinated debt 11,534   165   270   —   477   —   —   12,446   165   Preferred equity 22,608   7,796   7,511   —   —   —   ( 525 ) 37,390   7,271   Common equity & warrants 36,052   8,677   4,257   —   —   ( 11,881 ) —   37,105   4,042   Total Investments $ 631,274   $ 13,849   $ 409,043   $ ( 226,606 ) $ 3,550   $ ( 11,934 ) $ —   $ 819,176   $ 6,798   1 Includes purchases of new investments, as well as discount accretion on existing investments. 53 Table of Contents 5.     BORROWINGS In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limitations, effective April 25, 2019, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage (i.e., the ratio of assets less liabilities not represented by senior securities to senior securities such as borrowings), calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. The Board of Directors also approved a resolution which limits the Company’s issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than
166 %, which became effective April 25, 2019. On August 11, 2021, we received an exemptive order from SEC to permit us to exclude the senior securities issued by SBIC I or any future SBIC subsidiary of the Company from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s asset coverage was
229 %.
The Company had the following borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 (amounts in thousands): December 31, 2022 Outstanding Balance Unamortized Debt Issuance Costs and Debt Discount/Premium Recorded Value SBA Debentures $ 104,000   $ ( 3,418 ) $ 100,582   Credit Facility 225,000   —   225,000   January 2026 Notes 140,000   ( 1,033 ) 138,967   October 2026 Notes 150,000   ( 2,922 ) 147,078   $ 619,000   $ ( 7,373 ) $ 611,627   March 31, 2022 SBA Debentures $ 40,000   $ ( 1,648 ) $ 38,352   Credit Facility 205,000   —   205,000   January 2026 Notes 140,000   ( 1,286 ) 138,714   October 2026 Notes 150,000   ( 3,478 ) 146,522   $ 535,000   $ ( 6,412 ) $ 528,588   Credit Facility In August 2016, CSWC entered into a senior secured credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities.
On August 9, 2021, CSWC entered into the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"). Prior to the Credit Agreement, (1) borrowings under the Credit Facility accrued interest on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus
2.50 % with
no
LIBOR floor, and (2) the total borrowing capacity was $ 340  million with commitments from a diversified group of
eleven
lenders. The Credit Agreement (1) decreased the total borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility to $ 335  million with commitments from a diversified group of
ten
lenders, (2) reduced the interest rate on borrowings to LIBOR plus
2.15 % with
no
LIBOR floor and removed conditions related thereto as previously set forth in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, and (3) extended the end of the Credit Facility's revolver period from December 21, 2022 to August 9, 2025 and extended the final maturity from December 21, 2023 to August 9, 2026. The Credit Agreement also modified certain covenants in the Credit Facility, including, among other things, to increase the minimum obligors’ net worth test from $ 180  million to $ 200  million.
The Credit Facility contains an accordion feature that allows CSWC to increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility up to $ 400  million from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments.
54 Table of Contents On May 11, 2022, CSWC entered into Amendment No. 2 (the "Amendment") to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment changed the benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to Adjusted Term SOFR. In addition, CSWC entered into an Incremental Commitment Agreement, pursuant to which the total commitments under the Credit Agreement increased from $ 335  million to $ 380  million.
On November 16, 2022, CSWC entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement that increased the total commitments under the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement by $ 20  million, which increased total commitments from $ 380  million to $ 400  million. The $ 20  million increase was provided by one existing lender and one new lender, bringing the total bank syndicate to
eleven
participants.
CSWC pays unused commitment fees of
0.50 % to
1.00 % per annum, based on utilization, on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to: (1) certain reporting requirements, (2) maintaining RIC and BDC status, (3) maintaining a minimum senior coverage ratio of
2
to 1, (4) maintaining a minimum shareholders’ equity, (5) maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth, (6) maintaining a regulatory asset coverage of not less than
150 %, (7) maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least
2.25
to 1.0, and (8) at any time the outstanding advances exceed
90 % of the borrowing base, maintaining a minimum liquidity of not less than
10 % of the covered debt amount.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, bankruptcy, and change of control, with customary cure and notice provisions. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests.
The Credit Facility is secured by (1) substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and the guarantors and (2) 100% of the equity interests in the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of the Company’s assets were pledged as collateral for the Credit Facility, except for assets held in SBIC I. At December 31, 2022, CSWC had $ 225.0
million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. CSWC recognized interest expense related to the Credit Facility, including unused commitment fees and amortization of deferred loan costs, of $ 3.9
million and $ 8.8
million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, CSWC recognized interest expense of $ 1.6

million and $ 208.6
million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, average borrowings were $ 200.2
million and $ 165.8
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, CSWC was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. October 2024 Notes In September 2019, the Company issued $ 65.0  million in aggregate principal amount of
5.375 % Notes due 2024 (the “Existing October 2024 Notes”). In October 2019, the Company issued an additional $ 10.0  million in aggregate principal amount of the October 2024 Notes (the "Additional October 2024 Notes").
In August 2020, the Company issued an additional $ 50.0  million in aggregate principal amount of the October 2024 Notes (the "New Notes" together with the Existing October 2024 Notes and the Additional October 2024 Notes, the "October 2024 Notes"). The Additional October 2024 Notes and the New Notes were treated as a single series with the Existing October 2024 Notes under the indenture and had the same terms as the Existing October 2024 Notes. The maturity date of the October 2024 Notes was October 1, 2024, and the October 2024 Notes were redeemable in whole or in part at any time prior to July 1, 2024, at par plus a “make-whole” premium, and thereafter at par. The October 2024 Notes bore interest at a rate of
5.375 % per year.
On September 24, 2021, the Company redeemed $ 125.0
million in aggregate principal amount of the issued and outstanding October 2024 Notes. The October 2024 Notes were redeemed at
100 % of their principal amount, plus (i) the accrued and unpaid interest thereon, through, but excluding the redemption date, and (ii) a "make-whole" premium.
55 Table of Contents Accordingly, the Company recognized a realized loss on extinguishment of debt, equal to the write-off of the related unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 1.8  million and the "make-whole" premium of $ 15.2  million during the three months ended September 30, 2021. The Company did
no t recognize any interest expense related to the October 2024 Notes for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized interest expense related to the October 2024 Notes, including amortization of deferred issuance costs, of $ 3.6

In February 2021, the Company issued an additional $ 65.0  million in aggregate principal amount of the January 2026 Notes (the "Additional January 2026 Notes" together with the Existing January 2026 Notes, the "January 2026 Notes"). The Additional January 2026 Notes were issued at a price of
102.11 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Additional January 2026 Notes, resulting in a yield-to-maturity of approximately
4.0 % at issuance. The Additional January 2026 Notes are treated as a single series with the Existing January 2026 Notes under the indenture and have the same terms as the Existing January 2026 Notes. The January 2026 Notes mature on January 31, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time prior to October 31, 2025, at par plus a "make-whole" premium, and thereafter at par. The January 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of
4.50 % per year, payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The January 2026 Notes are the direct unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with our other outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and are effectively or structurally subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including borrowings under our Credit Facility and the SBA Debentures. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the January 2026 Notes was $ 139.0
million on an aggregate principal amount of $ 140.0  million at a weighted average effective yield of
4.46 %. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the January 2026 Notes was $ 121.9

SBA Debentures On April 20, 2021, SBIC I received a license from the SBA to operate as an SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. The license allows SBIC I to obtain leverage by issuing SBA Debentures, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA. SBA Debentures are loans issued to an SBIC which have interest payable semi-annually and a
ten-year
maturity. The interest rate is fixed shortly after issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with
ten-year
maturities. Interest on SBA Debentures is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. Current statutes and regulations permit SBIC I to borrow up to $ 175  million in SBA Debentures with at least $ 87.5  million in regulatory capital (as defined in the SBA regulations). On May 25, 2021, SBIC I received a leverage commitment from the SBA in the amount of $ 40.0  million to be issued on or prior to September 30, 2025. On January 28, 2022, SBIC I received an additional leverage commitment in the amount of $ 40.0  million to be issued on or prior to September 30, 2026. On November 22, 2022, SBIC I received an additional leverage commitment in the amount of $ 50.0  million to be issued on or prior to September 30, 2027. As of December 31, 2022, SBIC I had regulatory capital of $ 65.0  million and leverageable capital of $ 65.0  million. As of December 31, 2022, SBIC I had a total leverage commitment from the SBA in the amount of $ 130.0  million, of which $ 26.0  million remains unused. The SBA may limit the amount that may be drawn each year under these commitments, and each issuance of leverage is conditioned on the Company’s full compliance, as determined by the SBA, with the terms and conditions set forth in the SBA regulations. 57 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of SBA Debentures was $ 100.6  million on an aggregate principal amount of $ 104.0  million. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the SBA Debentures was $ 97.4  million. The fair value of the SBA Debentures is estimated by discounting the remaining payments using current market rates for similar instruments and considering such factors as the legal maturity date and the ability of market participants to prepay the SBA Debentures, which are Level 3 inputs under ASC 820. The Company recognized interest expense and related fees related to SBA Debentures of $ 0.9  million and $ 1.9  million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized interest expense of $ 0.1  million and $ 0.2  million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the SBA Debentures was
3.70 % and

1.43 % and
1.24 %, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, average borrowings were $ 83.9  million and $ 54.1  million, respectively. Average borrowings for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 were $ 21.0  million and $ 10.1  million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's issued and outstanding SBA Debentures mature as follows (amounts in thousands): Pooling Date (1) Maturity Date Fixed Interest Rate December 31, 2022 9/22/2021 9/1/2031 1.575 % $ 15,000   3/23/2022 3/1/2032 3.209 % 25,000   9/21/2022 9/1/2032 4.533 % 40,000   (2) (2) (2) 24,000   $ 104,000   (1) The SBA has
two
scheduled pooling dates for SBA Debentures (in March and in September). Certain SBA Debentures funded during the reporting periods may not be pooled until the subsequent pooling date. (2) The Company issued $ 24.0  million in SBA Debentures that will pool in March 2023. Until the pooling date, the SBA Debentures bear interest at a fixed rate with a weighted-average interim interest rate of
5.14 %.
6.     INCOME TAXES We have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and have a tax year end of December 31. In order to qualify as a RIC, we must annually distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, to our shareholders in a timely manner. Investment company income generally includes net short-term capital gains but excludes net long-term capital gains. A RIC is not subject to federal income tax on the portion of its ordinary income and capital gains that is distributed to its shareholders, including “deemed distributions” as discussed below. As part of maintaining RIC tax treatment, undistributed taxable income and capital gain, which is subject to a 4% non-deductible U.S. federal excise tax, pertaining to a given fiscal year may be distributed up to 12 months subsequent to the end of that fiscal year, provided such dividends are declared on or prior to the later of (1) the extended due date of the U.S. federal income tax return for the applicable fiscal year and (2) the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the year in which such taxable income was generated.
As of December 31, 2022, CSWC qualified for RIC tax treatment. We intend to meet the applicable qualifications to be taxed as a RIC in future periods. However, the Company’s ability to meet certain portfolio diversification requirements of RICs in future years may not be controllable by the Company. Book and tax basis differences relating to dividends and distributions to our shareholders and other permanent book and tax differences are typically reclassified among the CSWC’s capital accounts. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from U.S. GAAP; accordingly, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, CSWC reclassified for book purposes amounts arising from permanent book/tax differences related to the tax treatment of return of capital and/or deemed distributions, tax treatment of investments upon disposition, and non-deductible expenses, as follows (amounts in thousands): 58 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Additional capital $ ( 5,126 ) $ ( 6,255 ) Total distributable earnings 5,126   6,255   The determination of the tax attributes for CSWC’s distributions is made annually, based upon its taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, any determination made on an interim basis is forward-looking based on currently available facts, rules and assumptions and may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for a full year.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, CSWC declared total dividends of $ 11.8  million, or $ 0.48
per share. During the quarter ended June 30, 2022, CSWC declared total dividends of $ 16.6  million, or $ 0.63
per share ($ 0.48
per share in regular dividends and $ 0.15
per share in special dividends). During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, CSWC declared total dividends of $ 14.3  million, or $ 0.50
per share. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, CSWC declared total dividends of $ 19.3  million, or $ 0.57
per share ($ 0.52
per share in regular dividends and $ 0.05
per share in supplemental dividends). Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify for the 20% maximum tax rate on dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include both ordinary income and capital gains, but may also include qualified dividends or return of capital.
The tax character of distributions paid for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (amounts in thousands): Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Ordinary income $ 60,960   $ 56,633   Distributions of long term capital gains —   —   Distributions on tax basis $ 60,960   $ 56,633   The following reconciles net increase in net assets resulting from operations to estimated RIC taxable income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Nine Months Ended December 31, Reconciliation of RIC Distributable Income 1 2022 2021 Net increase in net assets from operations $ 14,917   $ 23,146   Net unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on investments 13,989   ( 4,306 ) Income/gain (expense/loss) recognized for tax on pass-through entities 10   1,558   (Gain) loss recognized on dispositions ( 1,473 ) 329   Capital loss carryover 2 14,454   308   Net operating income - wholly-owned subsidiary 1,071   ( 9,186 ) Dividend income from wholly-owned subsidiary 1,068   —   Non-deductible tax expense 466   191   Loss on extinguishment of debt —   12,950   Non-deductible compensation 2,443   2,688   Compensation related book/tax differences ( 1,471 ) 2,542   Other book/tax differences 1,839   3,518   Estimated distributable income before deductions for distributions $ 47,313   $ 33,738   59 Table of Contents 1 The calculation of taxable income for each period is an estimate and will not be finally determined until the Company files its tax return each year. Final taxable income may be different than this estimate. 2 At December 31, 2022, the Company had long-term capital loss carryforwards of $ 31.9  million to offset future capital gains. These capital loss carryforwards are not subject to expiration. A RIC may elect to retain all or a portion of its net capital gains by designating them as a “deemed distribution” to its shareholders and paying a federal tax on the net capital gains for the benefit of its shareholders. Shareholders then report their share of the retained capital gains on their income tax returns as if it had been received and report a tax credit for tax paid on their behalf by the RIC. Shareholders then add the amount of the “deemed distribution” net of such tax to the basis of their shares.
In addition, the Taxable Subsidiary holds a portion of one or more of our portfolio investments that are listed on the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The Taxable Subsidiary is consolidated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, so that our consolidated financial statements reflect our investments in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiary. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiary is to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90% of our gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiary, a proportionate amount of any gross income of a partnership or LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment would flow through directly to us. To the extent that our income did not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC and therefore cause us to incur significant amounts of U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates. Where interests in LLCs (or other pass-through entities) are owned by the Taxable Subsidiary, however, the income from those interests is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiary and does not flow through to us, thereby helping us preserve our RIC tax treatment and resultant tax advantages. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate an income tax provision as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. The income tax provision, or benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, if any, are reflected in our Statement of Operations.
As of December 31, 2022, the cost of investments held at the RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes was $ 1,116.8
million, with such investments having gross unrealized appreciation of $ 9.7
million and gross unrealized depreciation of $ 64.3
million, resulting in net unrealized depreciation of $ 54.6
million. As of December 31, 2022, the cost of investments held at the Taxable Subsidiary for U.S. federal income tax purposes was $ 33.8
million, with such investments having gross unrealized appreciation of $ 57.2
million and gross unrealized depreciation of $ 2.4
million, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of $ 54.8
million. On a consolidated basis, the total investment portfolio has net unrealized appreciation of $ 0.2
million for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiary is not a RIC and is required to pay taxes at the current corporate rate. For tax purposes, the Taxable Subsidiary has elected to be treated as a taxable entity, and therefore is not consolidated for tax purposes and is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income and, as a result of its activities, may generate an income tax provision or benefit.
The taxable income, or loss, of the Taxable Subsidiary may differ from book income, or loss, due to temporary book and tax timing differences and permanent differences. This income tax provision, or benefit, if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The Taxable Subsidiary records valuation adjustments related to its investments on a quarterly basis. Deferred taxes related to the unrealized gain/loss on investments are also recorded on a quarterly basis. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Establishing a valuation allowance of a deferred tax asset requires management to make estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Taxable Subsidiary had a deferred tax liability of $ 11.4
million and $ 5.7
million, respectively. Based on our assessment of our unrecognized tax benefits, management believes that all benefits will be realized and they do not contain any uncertain tax positions.
60 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 (amounts in thousands): December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Deferred tax asset: Net operating loss carryforwards $ —   $ —   Interest 220 185   Total deferred tax asset 220 185 Deferred tax liabilities: Net unrealized appreciation on investments ( 10,911 ) ( 4,899 ) Net basis differences in portfolio investments ( 736 ) ( 1,033 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 11,647 ) ( 5,932 ) Total net deferred tax (liabilities) assets $ ( 11,427 ) $ ( 5,747 ) The income tax provision, or benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, generated by CSWC and the Taxable Subsidiary, if any, are reflected in CSWC’s consolidated financial statements. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net income tax benefit of $ 0.7
million, principally consisting of a $ 0.2  million accrual for U.S. federal excise tax and $ 0.9
million of tax benefit relating to the Taxable Subsidiary. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net income tax benefit of $20.6 thousand, principally consisting of a $ 0.5
million accrual for U.S. federal excise tax and a $ 0.5
million tax benefit relating to the Taxable Subsidiary. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net income tax benefit of $ 0.1  million, principally consisting of a $ 0.1  million accrual for U.S. federal excise tax and a $ 0.2  million tax benefit relating to the Taxable Subsidiary. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net income tax provision of $ 0.6  million, principally consisting of a $ 0.2  million accrual for U.S. federal excise tax and a $0.4 million tax provision relating to the Taxable Subsidiary.
Although we believe our tax returns are correct, the final determination of tax examinations could be different from what was reported on the returns. In our opinion, we have made adequate tax provisions for years subject to examination. Generally, we are currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service as well as state taxing authorities for the years ended December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2021.

Share Repurchases
The right to grant restricted stock awards under the 2010 Plan terminated on July 18, 2021,
ten years
after the date that the 2010 Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders pursuant to its terms. In connection with the termination of the 2010 Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors and shareholders approved the 2021 Employee Plan, which became effective on July 28, 2021, as part of the compensation package for its employees, the terms of which are, in all material respects, identical to the 2010 Plan. On July 19, 2021, we received an exemptive order that supersedes the prior exemptive order relating to the 2010 Plan (the “Order”) to permit the Company to (i) issue restricted stock as part
62 Table of Contents of the compensation package for its employees in the 2021 Employee Plan, and (ii) withhold shares of the Company’s common stock or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock from the participants to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of restricted stock pursuant to the 2021 Employee Plan. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors and shareholders approved the Capital Southwest Corporation 2021 Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan (the "Non-Employee Director Plan"), which became effective on July 27, 2022, as part of the compensation package for non-employee directors of the Board of Directors. In connection therewith, on May 16, 2022, we received an exemptive order that supersedes the Order (the "Superseding Order") and will cover both employees and non-employee directors of the Board of Directors.
The following table summarizes certain information relating to shares repurchased in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Number of shares repurchased 19,917   31,492   Aggregate cost of shares repurchased (in thousands) $ 380   $ 862   Weighted average price per share $ 19.09   $ 27.38   Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Number of shares repurchased 49,590   52,124   Aggregate cost of shares repurchased (in thousands) $ 1,021   $ 1,408   Weighted average price per share $ 20.59   $ 27.01   On July 28, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $ 20  million of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below its NAV per share, in accordance with guidelines specified in Rules 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. On August 31, 2021, the Company entered into a share repurchase agreement, which became effective immediately, and the Company will cease purchasing its common stock under the share repurchase program upon the earlier of, among other things: (1) the date on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares equals $ 20  million including, without limitation, all applicable fees, costs and expenses; or (2) upon written notice by the Company to the broker that the share repurchase agreement is terminated. 8.     STOCK BASED COMPENSATION PLANS Under the 2010 Plan and the 2021 Employee Plan, a restricted stock award is an award of shares of our common stock, which have full voting and dividend rights but are restricted with regard to sale or transfer.  Restricted stock awards are independent of stock grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to these restrictions lapsing. Unless otherwise specified in the award agreement, these shares vest in equal annual installments over a
four-year
period from the grant date and are expensed over the vesting period starting on the grant date. The right to grant restricted stock awards under the 2010 Plan terminated on July 18, 2021,
ten years
after the date that the 2010 Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders pursuant to its terms.
In connection with the termination of the 2010 Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors and shareholders approved the 2021 Employee Plan as part of the compensation packages for its employees, the terms of which are, in all material respects, identical to the 2010 Plan.
The 2021 Employee Plan makes available for issuance
1,200,000
shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, there are
1,002,633
shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2021 Employee Plan. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors and shareholders approved the Non-Employee Director Plan as part of the compensation package for non-employee directors of the Board of Directors. Under the Non-Employee Director Plan, at the beginning of each
one-year
term of service on our Board, each non-employee director will receive a number of shares equivalent to $ 50,000
based on the market value at the close of the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant. These shares will vest
one year
from the date of the grant and are expensed over the
one-year
term of non-employee directors. The Non-Employee Director Plan makes available for issuance
120,000
shares of common stock. As
63 Table of Contents of December 31, 2022, there are
107,895
shares of common stock available for issuance under the Non-Employee Director Plan. We expense the cost of the restricted stock awards, which is determined to equal the fair value of the restricted stock award at the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For these purposes, the fair value of the restricted stock award is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized total share based compensation expense of $ 1.0  million (of which $ 62.9  thousand was related to restricted stock issued to non-employee directors) and $ 0.8  million, respectively, related to the restricted stock issued. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized total share based compensation expense of $ 2.9  million (of which $ 98.4  thousand was related to restricted stock issued to non-employee directors) and $ 2.8  million, respectively, related to the restricted stock issued. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Company modified restricted stock awards to accelerate vesting of the unvested awards as of the separation date for
one
employee. The Company accounted for this as a modification of awards and recognized incremental compensation cost of $ 0.6  million. The incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms were modified and recognized as compensation cost on the date of modification for vested awards. As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards was $ 8.0  million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average vesting period of approximately
2.6
years.

All full-time employees are eligible to participate in the 401K Plan.
The 401K Plan permits employees to defer a portion of their total annual compensation up to the Internal Revenue Service annual maximum based on age and eligibility.
We made contributions to the 401K Plan of up to
4.5 % of the Internal Revenue Service’s annual maximum eligible compensation, all of which is fully vested immediately. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we made matching contributions of approximately $ 28.6  thousand and $ 25.9  thousand, respectively. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we made matching contributions of approximately $ 158.1  thousand and $ 133.9  thousand, respectively. 65 Table of Contents 10.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments
In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, consisting primarily of unused commitments to extend financing to the Company’s portfolio companies. Because commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Additionally, our commitment to fund delayed draw term loans generally is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions, such as meeting certain financial performance hurdles or financial covenants, which may limit a borrower's ability to draw on such delayed draw term loans.
The balances of unused commitments to extend financing as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 were as follows (amounts in thousands): December 31, March 31,

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 0.9  million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of portfolio companies. For all of these letters of credit issued and outstanding, the Company would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, $ 0.4  million expire in February 2023, $ 0.2  million expire in April 2023, and $ 0.3  million expire in August 2023. As of December 31, 2022, none of the letters of credit issued and outstanding were recorded as a liability on the Company's balance sheet as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company. Effective April 1, 2019, ASC 842 required that a lessee evaluate its leases to determine whether they should be classified as operating or financing leases. The Company previously had an operating lease for its office space that commenced October 1, 2014 and expired February 28, 2022. In March 2021, the Company executed an agreement to lease new office space that commenced on February 1, 2022 and expires September 30, 2032. The Company identified the foregoing as an operating lease. ASC 842 indicates that an ROU asset and lease liability should be recorded based on the effective date. As such, CSWC recorded an ROU asset, which is included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, and a lease liability, which is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, as of February 1, 2022. The Company has recorded lease expense on a straight-line basis. Total lease expense incurred for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 63.1  thousand and $ 189.2  thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, total lease expense incurred was $ 58.1  thousand and $ 174.4  thousand, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the asset related to the operating lease was $ 1.9  million and the lease liability was $ 2.9  million. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining lease term was
9.8

13.     SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES I-45 SLF LLC In September 2015, we entered into a limited liability company agreement with Main Street Capital Corporation ("Main Street") to form I-45 SLF LLC (the "Initial I-45 LLC Agreement"). I-45 SLF LLC began investing in UMM syndicated senior secured loans during the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The initial equity capital commitment to I-45 SLF LLC totaled $ 85.0  million, consisting of $ 68.0  million from CSWC and $ 17.0  million from Main Street. On April 30, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Initial I-45 LLC Agreement, each of CSWC and Main Street made an additional equity capital commitment of $ 12.8  million and $ 3.2  million, respectively, which resulted in a total equity capital commitment to I-45 SLF LLC of $ 80.8  million and $ 20.2  million, respectively.
On March 11, 2021, the Company and Main Street entered into the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (the "Amendment"), which increased the current profits interest that is allocated to the Company on a pro rata basis from (a)
75.6 % to (b) an amount equal to: (i)
76.2625 % as of the date of the Amendment through the quarter ended March 31, 2021; (ii)
76.925 % for quarter ended June 30, 2021; (iii)
77.5875 % for the quarter ended September 30, 2021; and (iv)
78.25 % for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 and periods thereafter. On March 25, 2021, I-45 SLF LLC declared a return of capital dividend to its members in the amount of $ 10.0  million. As of December 31, 2022, total funded equity capital totaled $ 95.0  million, consisting of $ 76.0  million from CSWC and $ 19.0  million from Main Street. CSWC owns
80 % of I-45 SLF LLC and has a current profits interest of
78.25 %, while Main Street owns
20 % and has a current profits interest of
21.75 %.  I-45 SLF LLC's Board of Managers makes all investment and operational decisions for the fund, and consists of equal representation from CSWC and Main Street. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, I-45 SLF LLC had total assets of $ 166.2
million and $ 189.1
million, respectively. I-45 SLF LLC had approximately $ 161.0
million and $ 176.7
million of total investments at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

During the three months ended December 31, 2022, I-45 SLF LLC declared a total dividend of $ 2.4  million of which $ 1.9
million was paid to CSWC in January 2023. Additionally, I-45 SLF LLC closed on a $ 75.0  million
5 -year senior secured credit facility (the “I-45 credit facility”) in November 2015. The I-45 credit facility includes an accordion feature which will allow I-45 SLF LLC to achieve leverage of approximately
2 x debt-to-equity. Borrowings under the I-45 credit facility are secured by all of the assets of I-45 SLF LLC and bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus
2.5 % per annum. During the year ended March 31, 2017, I-45 SLF LLC increased debt commitments outstanding by an additional $ 90.0  million by adding
three
additional lenders to the syndicate, bringing total debt commitments to $ 165.0  million. In July 2017, the I-45 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity to July 2022. Additionally, the amendment reduced the interest rate on borrowings to LIBOR plus
2.4 % per annum. In November 2019, the I-45 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity to November 2024 and to reduce the interest rate on borrowings to LIBOR plus
2.25 % per annum. On April 30, 2020, the I-45 credit facility was amended to permanently reduce the I-45 credit facility amount through a prepayment of $ 15.0  million and to change the minimum utilization requirements. In March 2021, the I-45 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity to March 25, 2026 and to reduce the interest rate on borrowings to LIBOR plus
2.15 %. Under the I-45 credit facility, $ 104.0
million has been drawn as of December 31, 2022.

The information contained herein may contain “forward-looking statements” based on our current expectations, assumptions and estimates about us and our industry.
These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.
Words such as “may,” “predict,” “will,” “continue,” “likely,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “potential,” “estimate,” “indicate,” “seek,” “believe,” “target,” “intend,” “plan,” or “project” and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
These risks include risks related to changes in the markets in which the Company invests; changes in the financial and lending markets; interest rate volatility, including the decommissioning of LIBOR and rising interest rates; the impact of supply chain constraints and labor difficulties on our portfolio companies and the global economy; the elevated level of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; regulatory changes; tax treatment and general economic and business conditions; our ability to operate our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP, as a small business investment company; and uncertainties associated with the continued impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and new variants of COVID-19, including its impact on the global and U.S. capital markets and the global and U.S. economy, the length and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States as well as worldwide and the magnitude of the economic impact of that outbreak; the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business prospects and the operational and financial performance of our portfolio companies, including our ability and their ability to achieve their respective objectives, and the effects of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to continue to effectively manage our business.
In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Our actual results could differ materially from those we express in the forward-looking statements as a result of several factors more fully described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made.
You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and other financial information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. OVERVIEW We are an internally managed closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We specialize in providing customized debt and equity financing to LMM companies and debt capital to UMM companies in a broad range of investment segments located primarily in the United States.
Our investment objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments.
Our investment strategy is to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions to fund growth, changes of control, or other corporate events. We invest primarily in senior debt securities, secured by security interests in portfolio company assets. We also invest in equity interests in our portfolio companies alongside our debt securities.
We focus on investing in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow, established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline. We primarily target senior debt and equity investments in LMM companies, and opportunistically target first and second lien loans in UMM companies.
Our target LMM companies typically have annual EBITDA between $3.0 million and $20.0 million, and our LMM investments generally range in size from $5.0 million to $35.0 million. Our UMM investments generally include first and second lien loans in companies with EBITDA generally greater than $20.0 million, and our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $20.0 million.
We seek to fill the financing gap for LMM companies, which, historically, have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources. The underserved nature of the LMM creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of LMM companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations. Our ability to invest across a LMM company’s capital structure, from secured loans to equity securities, allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options. Providing customized financing solutions is important to LMM companies. We generally seek to partner directly with financial sponsors,
84 Table of Contents entrepreneurs, management teams and business owners in making our investments. Our LMM debt investments typically include senior loans with a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company. Our LMM debt investments typically have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date. We also often seek to invest in the equity securities of our LMM portfolio companies.
Our investments in UMM companies primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in privately held companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and seven years from the original investment date. Because we are internally managed, we do not pay any external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms that are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the ratio of our last twelve months ("LTM") operating expenses, excluding interest expense, as a percentage of our LTM average total assets was 1.89% and 2.73%, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. Valuation of Investments The most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our investment portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, our investment portfolio at fair value represented approximately 95.7% and 96.2% of our total assets, respectively. We are required to report our investments at fair value. We follow the provisions of ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market.  See Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our investment portfolio valuation process and procedures. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our investment portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities actually existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance, and other events may occur over the lives of the investments that may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Our Board of Directors is responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. Our Board of Directors believes that our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 reflects the fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.  85 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Interest and Dividend Income Interest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected.
Dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Discounts/premiums received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted or amortized into income over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. In accordance with our valuation policy, accrued interest and dividend income is evaluated quarterly for collectability. When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due.
If a loan or debt security’s status significantly improves regarding its ability to service debt or other obligations, it will be restored to accrual basis. As of December 31, 2022, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 0.3% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.4% of its cost. As of March 31, 2022, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 1.5% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 2.6% of its cost. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference rate reform (Topic 848)—Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting." The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to certain contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform and became effective upon issuance for all entities. The Company has agreements that have LIBOR as a reference rate with certain portfolio companies and certain lenders. Many of these agreements include an alternative successor rate or language for choosing an alternative successor rate when LIBOR reference is no longer considered to be appropriate. With respect to other agreements, the Company intends to work with its portfolio companies and certain lenders to modify agreements to choose an alternative successor rate. Contract modifications are required to be evaluated in determining whether the modifications result in the establishment of new contracts or the continuation of existing contracts. On December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 "Reference rate reform (Topic 848)—Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848," which defers the sunset date of ASC 848 until December 31, 2024. ASU 2022-06 became effective upon issuance. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024, except for hedging transactions as of December 31, 2024, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The Company does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or its disclosure and did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,” which was issued to (1) clarify the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, (2) amend a related illustrative example, and (3) introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or its disclosure.
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION The total value of our investment portfolio was $1,150.0 million as of December 31, 2022, as compared to $936.6 million as of March 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had investments in 82 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $1,159.7 million. As of March 31, 2022, we had investments in 73 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $938.3 million. 86 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, approximately $957.4 million, or 96.7%, and $772.7 million, or 97.3%, respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at floating rates, of which 100.0% were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. As of both December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the weighted average contractual minimum interest rate is 1.14% and 1.08%, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, approximately $32.9 million, or 3.3%, and $21.1 million, or 2.7%, respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at fixed rates. The following tables provide a summary of our investments in portfolio companies as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 (excluding our investment in I-45 SLF LLC): December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands) Number of portfolio companies (a) 81 72 Fair value $ 1,102,421  $ 879,011  Cost $ 1,083,712  $ 862,303  % of portfolio at fair value - debt 89.8  % 90.3  % % of portfolio at fair value - equity 10.2  % 9.7  % % of investments at fair value secured by first lien 86.5  % 84.2  % Weighted average annual effective yield on debt investments (b) 12.0  % 9.3  % Weighted average annual effective yield on total investments (c) 11.7  % 9.0  % Weighted average EBITDA (d) $ 22,102  $ 20,889  Weighted average leverage through CSWC security (e) 3.6x 4.0x (a) At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we had equity ownership in approximately 59.3% and 56.9%, respectively, of our investments. (b) The weighted average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates during the quarter for all debt investments at cost as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively, including accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments. As of December 31, 2022, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 0.3% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.4% of its cost. As of March 31, 2022, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 1.5% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 2.6% of its cost. Weighted average annual effective yield is not a return to shareholders and is higher than what an investor in shares in our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. (c) The weighted average annual effective yields on total investments were calculated by dividing total investment income, exclusive of non-recurring fees, by average total investments at fair value. (d) Includes CSWC debt investments only. Weighted average EBITDA metric is calculated using investment cost basis weighting. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, nine portfolio companies are excluded from this calculation due to a reported debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio that was not meaningful. For the year ended March 31, 2022, three portfolio companies are excluded from this calculation due to a reported debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio that was not meaningful. (e) Includes CSWC debt investments only. Calculated as the amount of each portfolio company’s debt (including CSWC’s position and debt senior or pari passu to CSWC’s position, but excluding debt subordinated to CSWC’s position) in the capital structure divided by each portfolio company’s adjusted EBITDA. Weighted average leverage is calculated using investment cost basis weighting. Management uses this metric as a guide to evaluate relative risk of its position in each portfolio debt investment. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, nine portfolio companies are excluded from this calculation due to a reported debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio that was not meaningful. For the year ended March 31, 2022, three portfolio companies are excluded from this calculation due to a reported debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio that was not meaningful. Portfolio Asset Quality We utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance and monitor the expected level of returns for each debt investment in our portfolio. The investment rating system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio company and the investments held therein, including each investment's expected level of returns and the collectability of our debt investments, comparisons to competitors and
87 Table of Contents other industry participants and the portfolio company's future outlook. The ratings are not intended to reflect the performance or expected level of returns of our equity investments. • Investment Rating 1 represents the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment is performing materially above underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. The investment generally has a higher probability of being prepaid in part or in full. • Investment Rating 2 indicates the investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable to neutral. All new loans are initially rated 2.
• Investment Rating 3 involves an investment performing below underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally neutral to negative. The investment may be out of compliance with financial covenants and interest payments may be impaired, however principal payments are generally not past due.
• Investment Rating 4 indicates that the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations, the trends and risk factors are generally negative and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. Interest and principal payments on our investment are likely to be impaired.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (including any new variants of COVID-19) on our portfolio companies, our due diligence and underwriting processes, and financial markets. The operational and financial performance of the portfolio companies in which we make investments may be significantly impacted by COVID-19, which may in turn impact the valuation of our investments.
We also
have observed, and continue to observe, supply chain disruptions, labor and resource shortages, commodity inflation, elements of financial market instability (including rapidly rising interest rates), an uncertain economic outlook for the United States (which may include a recession), and elements of geopolitical instability (including the ongoing war in Ukraine and U.S. and China relations).
I n the event that the U.S. economy enters into a protracted recession, it is possible that the results of certain U.S. middle market companies could experience deterioration.
We are closely monitoring the effect of such market volatility may have on our portfolio companies and our investment activities, and we have also increased oversight of credits in vulnerable industries to mitigate any decline in loan performance and reduce credit risk. The following table shows the distribution of our debt portfolio investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022: As of December 31, 2022 Investment Rating Debt Investments at Fair Value Percentage of Debt Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 1 $ 118,016  11.9  % 2 823,966  83.2  3 47,993  4.8  4 323  0.1  Total $ 990,298  100.0  % 88 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2022 Investment Rating Debt Investments at Fair Value Percentage of Debt Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 1 $ 124,192  15.6  % 2 632,675  79.7  3 36,648  4.6  4 319  0.1  Total $ 793,834  100.0  % Interest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected.
When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. As of December 31, 2022, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 0.3% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.4% of its cost. As of March 31, 2022, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 1.5% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 2.6% of its cost.
Investment Activity During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we made new debt investments totaling $221.3 million, follow-on debt investments totaling $85.4 million, and equity investments totaling $7.9 million.

We funded $28.8 million on revolving loans and received $17.7 million in repayments on revolving loans. In addition, we received proceeds from sales of debt and equity investments totaling $3.4 million.

The first is “Net investment income,” which is the difference between income from interest, dividends and fees and our combined operating and interest expenses, net of applicable income taxes.
The second element is “Net realized (loss) gain on investments, net of tax,” which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost. The third element is the “Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, net of tax,” which is the net change in the market or fair value of our investment portfolio, compared with stated cost. The “Net realized (loss) gain on investments before income tax” and “Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, net of tax” are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain, a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being “unrealized” to being “realized.”
Conversely, when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security, an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs. The fourth element is the “Realized loss on extinguishment of debt”, which is the difference between the principal amount due at maturity adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and any "make-whole" premium payable at the time of the debt extinguishment. Comparison of three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021

For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we reported investment income of $32.8 million, a $10.5 million, or 46.9%, increase as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an $11.4 million increase in interest income generated from our debt investments due to a 34.4% increase in the cost basis of debt investments held by us from $754.0 million to $1,013.4 million year-over-year, partially offset by a decrease in fee income of $1.7 million due to more non-recurring fees received in the prior quarter.
Operating Expenses Due to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation) and general and administrative expenses. Interest and Fees on our Borrowings For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our total interest expense was $7.9 million, an increase of $3.3 million, as compared to the total interest expense of $4.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our total debt from 3.18% to 4.69% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and
91 Table of Contents December 31, 2022, respectively. This increase in the weighted average interest rate was primarily due to an increase to the base rate on our Credit Facility. Salaries, General and Administrative Expenses For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) increased by $0.2 million, or 4.1%, as compared to the total employee compensation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our total general and administrative expense was $1.8 million, an increase of $0.2 million or 9.9%, as compared to the total general and administrative expense of $1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to individually immaterial increases across several general operating expenses. Net Investment Income For the three months ended December 31, 2022, income before taxes increased by $6.8 million, or 57.8%. Net investment income increased from the prior year period by $7.5 million, or 63.2%, to $19.4 million as a result of a $10.5 million increase in total investment income and a $0.7 million increase in income tax benefit, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in interest expense.
Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized net realized and unrealized losses totaling $16.5 million, which primarily consisted of net realized and unrealized losses on debt investments of $8.5 million, our investment in I-45 SLF LLC of $3.3 million and equity investments of $1.2 million. These realized and unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment, as well as exits of investments. We also recorded an income tax provision related to realized gains on investments of $0.1 million and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax of $3.4 million associated with the Taxable Subsidiary.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net realized and unrealized gains totaling $0.7 million, which primarily consisted of net realized and unrealized gains on equity investments of $5.5 million, partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on debt investments of $2.1 million and our investment in I-45 SLF LLC of $2.0 million. These realized and unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment, as well as exits of investments. We also recorded an income tax provision related to realized gains on investments of $1.4 million and net unrealized appreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.7 million.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we reported investment income of $82.1 million, a $20.9 million, or 34.2%, increase as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $21.3 million increase in interest income generated from our debt investments due to a 34.4% increase in the cost basis of debt investments held by us from $754.0 million to $1,013.4 million year-over-year, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in fee income.
Operating Expenses Due to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation) and general and administrative expenses. Interest and Fees on our Borrowings For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our total interest expense was $20.1 million, an increase of $5.0 million, as compared to the total interest expense of $15.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our total debt from 3.71% to 4.05% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in the weighted average interest rate was primarily due to an increase to the base rate on our Credit Facility. Salaries, General and Administrative Expenses For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) increased by $0.1 million, or 1.2%, as compared to the total employee compensation expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our total general and administrative expense was $5.7 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 16.2%, as compared to the total general and administrative expense of $4.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional fees incurred in connection with the compensation consultant engaged by the Compensation Committee, an increase in audit fees and an increase in expenses related to the Company's new office space. 93 Table of Contents Net Investment Income For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, income before taxes increased by $15.0 million, or 47.8%. Net investment income increased from the prior year period by $15.6 million, or 51.0%, to $46.3 million as a result of a $20.9 million increase in total investment income and a $0.7 million decrease in income tax provision, partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in interest expense.
Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized net realized and unrealized losses totaling $31.4 million, which primarily consisted of net realized and unrealized losses on debt investments of $22.4 million and on I-45 SLF LLC of $10.0 million, partially offset by net realized and unrealized gains on equity investments of $7.3 million. These realized and unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment, as well as exits of investments. We also recorded an income tax provision related to realized gains on investments of $0.3 million and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax of $6.0 million associated with the Taxable Subsidiary.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net realized and unrealized gains totaling $9.6 million, which primarily consisted of net realized and unrealized gains on equity investments of $16.5 million, partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on debt investments of $1.9 million and I-45 SLF LLC of $2.8 million. These realized and unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment, as well as exits of investments. We also recorded an income tax provision related to realized gains on investments of $1.4 million and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.8 million.
Realized Loss on Extinguishment of Debt During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we did not recognize any loss on extinguishment of debt. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $17.1 million due to the full redemption of the October 2024 Notes, which included a make-whole premium of $15.2 million. 94 Table of Contents FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from cash flows from operations, the net proceeds of public offerings of debt and equity securities, advances from the Credit Facility and our continued access to the debentures guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (the "SBA Debentures"). Management believes that the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, cash available from investments, and commitments under the Credit Facility are adequate to meet its needs for the next twelve months. We anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through our ongoing operating activities, utilization of available borrowings under our Credit Facility and future issuances of debt and equity on terms we believe are favorable to the Company and our shareholders (including the Equity ATM Program, as described below). Our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and operating expenses. Due to the diverse capital sources available to us at this time, we believe we have adequate liquidity to support our near-term capital requirements. As the impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve and in light of current market conditions, we will continually evaluate our overall liquidity position and take proactive steps to maintain that position based on the current circumstances. This "Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources" section should be read in conjunction with the notes of our consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $10.3 million. During the foregoing period, our operating activities used $193.6 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $343.4 million, partially offset by $106.6 million from sales and repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies and $2.7 million from sales and return of capital of equity investments in portfolio companies. In addition, our financing activities provided cash of $204.1 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from the Equity ATM Program of $130.1 million, net proceeds from an underwritten equity offering of $44.1 million, net proceeds from the issuance of SBA debentures of $62.4 million and net borrowings on our Credit Facility of $20.0 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid in the amount of $50.2 million. At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $21.7 million. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $12.9 million. During that period, our operating activities used $139.1 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $410.1 million, partially offset by $221.5 million from sales and repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies and $11.9 million from sales and return of capital of equity investments in portfolio companies. In addition, our financing activities provided cash of $126.2 million, consisting primarily of net borrowings on our Credit Facility of $70.0 million, net proceeds from the Equity ATM Program of $73.3 million, net proceeds from the issuance of the October 2026 Notes of $146.4 million and net proceeds from issuance of SBA debentures of $28.3 million, partially offset by the redemption of the October 2024 Notes of $125.0 million and cash dividends paid in the amount of $46.8 million. At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $18.7 million. Financing Transactions In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limitations, effective April 25, 2019, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage (i.e., the ratio of assets less liabilities not represented by senior securities to senior securities such as borrowings), calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. The Board of Directors also approved a resolution which limits the Company’s issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, which became effective April 25, 2019. On August 11, 2021, we received an exemptive order from SEC to permit us to exclude the senior securities issued by SBIC I or any future SBIC subsidiary of the Company from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s asset coverage was 229%.
Credit Facility In August 2016, CSWC entered into a senior secured credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities.
95 Table of Contents On August 9, 2021, CSWC entered into the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement
(as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"). Prior to the Credit Agreement, (1) borrowings under the Credit Facility accrued interest on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 2.50% with no LIBOR floor, and (2) the total borrowing capacity was $340 million with commitments from a diversified group of eleven lenders. The Credit Agreement (1) decreased the total borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility to $335 million with commitments from a diversified group of ten lenders, (2) reduced the interest rate on borrowings to LIBOR plus 2.15% with no LIBOR floor and removed conditions related thereto as previously set forth in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, and (3) extended the end of the Credit Facility's revolver period from December 21, 2022 to August 9, 2025 and extended the final maturity from December 21, 2023 to August 9, 2026. The Credit Agreement also modified certain covenants in the Credit Facility, including, among other things, to increase the minimum obligors’ net worth test from $180 million to $200 million.
The Credit Facility contains an accordion feature that allows CSWC to increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility up to $400 million from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. On May 11, 2022, CSWC entered into Amendment No. 2 (the "Amendment") to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment changed the benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to Adjusted Term SOFR. In addition, CSWC entered into an Incremental Commitment Agreement, pursuant to which the total commitments under the Credit Agreement increased from $335 million to $380 million.
On November 16, 2022, CSWC entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement that increased the total commitments under the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement by $20 million, which increased total commitments from $380 million to $400 million. The $20 million increase was provided by one existing lender and one new lender, bringing the total bank syndicate to eleven participants. CSWC pays unused commitment fees of 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, based on utilization, on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to: (1) certain reporting requirements, (2) maintaining RIC and BDC status, (3) maintaining a minimum senior coverage ratio of 2 to 1, (4) maintaining a minimum shareholders’ equity, (5) maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth, (6) maintaining a regulatory asset coverage of not less than 150%, (7) maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.25 to 1.0, and (8) at any time the outstanding advances exceed 90% of the borrowing base, maintaining a minimum liquidity of not less than 10% of the covered debt amount.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, bankruptcy, and change of control, with customary cure and notice provisions. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests.
The Credit Facility is secured by (1) substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and the guarantors and (2) 100% of the equity interests in the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of the Company’s assets were pledged as collateral for the Credit Facility, except for assets held in SBIC I.

SBA Debentures On April 20, 2021, SBIC I received a license from the SBA to operate as an SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. The license allows SBIC I to obtain leverage by issuing SBA
98 Table of Contents Debentures, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA. SBA Debentures are loans issued to an SBIC which have interest payable semi-annually and a ten-year maturity. The interest rate is fixed shortly after issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. Interest on SBA Debentures is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. Current statutes and regulations permit SBIC I to borrow up to $175 million in SBA Debentures with at least $87.5 million in regulatory capital (as defined in the SBA regulations). On May 25, 2021, SBIC I received a leverage commitment from the SBA in the amount of $40.0 million to be issued on or prior to September 30, 2025. On January 28, 2022, SBIC I received an additional leverage commitment in the amount of $40.0 million to be issued on or prior to September 30, 2026.

As of December 31, 2022, SBIC I had a total leverage commitment from the SBA in the amount of $130.0 million, of which $26.0 million remains unused. The SBA may limit the amount that may be drawn each year under these commitments, and each issuance of leverage is conditioned on the Company’s full compliance, as determined by the SBA, with the terms and conditions set forth in the SBA regulations. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of SBA Debentures was $100.6 million on an aggregate principal amount of $104.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the SBA Debentures was $97.4 million. The fair value of the SBA Debentures is estimated by discounting the remaining payments using current market rates for similar instruments and considering such factors as the legal maturity date and the ability of market participants to prepay the SBA Debentures, which are Level 3 inputs under ASC 820. The Company recognized interest expense and related fees related to SBA Debentures of $0.9 million and $1.9 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized interest expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

(2) Includes interest payments. 101 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. Because commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Additionally, our commitment to fund delayed draw term loans generally is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions, such as meeting certain financial performance hurdles or financial covenants, which may limit a borrower's ability to draw on such delayed draw term loans.
At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we had a total of approximately $159.7 million and $134.3 million, respectively, in currently unfunded commitments (as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2022, the total unfunded commitments included commitments to issue
letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2022 , we had $0.9 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For the letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations.
Of these letters of credit, $0.4 million expire in February 2023, $0.2 million expire in April 2023, and $0.3 million expire in August 2023. As of December 31, 2022, none of the letters of credit issued and outstanding were recorded as a liability on the Company's balance sheet as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company. The Company believes its assets will provide adequate coverage to satisfy these unfunded commitments. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $21.7 million and $174.4 million in available borrowings under the Credit Facility.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS On January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a total dividend of $0.58 per share, comprised of a regular dividend of $0.53 and a supplemental dividend of $0.05, for the quarter ending March 31, 2023. The record date for the dividend is March 15, 2023. The payment date for the dividend is March 31, 2023. 102 Table of Contents Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risk. Market risk includes risk that arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies in which we invest; conditions affecting the general economy, including the impact of COVID-19 and any new variants of COVID-19; overall market changes, including an increase in market volatility due to COVID-19; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate volatility, including the decommissioning of LIBOR and rising interest rates. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing internals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Our net investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including the decommissioning of LIBOR and changes in alternate rates and prime rates, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates. A large portion of our portfolio is comprised of floating rate investments that utilize LIBOR or an alternative rate. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has been rapidly raising interest rates and has indicated that it would consider additional rate hikes in response to ongoing inflation concerns. In a rising interest rate environment, our
cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result the United States into a recession, which would likely decrease interest rates.
A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in base rates, such as LIBOR or SOFR, are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over such base rate that we earn on any portfolio investments or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to such base rate. See “Risk Factors — Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital the value of investments and net investment income,” “Risk Factors — The interest rates of our loans to our portfolio companies, any LIBOR-linked securities, and other financial obligations that extend beyond 2021 might be subject to change based on recent regulatory changes, including the decommissioning of LIBOR” and “Risk Factors — The interest rates of our loans to our portfolio companies, any LIBOR-linked securities, and other financial obligations that extend beyond 2021 might be subject to change based on recent regulatory changes, including the decommissioning of LIBOR” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 for more information. Our interest expenses also will be affected by changes in the published SOFR rate in connection with our Credit Facility. The interest rates on the October 2026 Notes, the January 2026 Notes and SBA Debentures are fixed for the life of such debt. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk and determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we were not a party to any hedging arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 96.7% of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at floating rates, 100.0% of which were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. Based on interest rates as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates could increase our net investment income by a maximum of $8.2 million, or $0.22 per share, on an annual basis. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates could decrease our net investment income by a maximum of $8.2 million, or $0.22 per share, on an annual basis. Our Credit Facility bears interest on a per annum basis equal to the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR rate plus 2.15%. We pay unused commitment fees of 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, based on utilization. Although we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our portfolio. It also does not adjust for other business developments, including future borrowings that could affect the net increase in net
103 Table of Contents assets resulting from operations, or net income. It also does not assume any repayments from borrowers. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above. Because we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. 104 Table of Contents Item 4.    Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon this evaluation, management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 105 Table of Contents PART II. – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.    Legal Proceedings We may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. We have no currently pending material legal proceedings to which we are party or to which any of our assets is subject. Item 1A.    Risk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a number of significant risks. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 that we filed with the SEC on May 24, 2022. Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On July 28, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $20 million of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below its NAV per share, in accordance with guidelines specified in Rules 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. On August 31, 2021 the Company entered into a share repurchase agreement, which became effective immediately, and the Company will cease purchasing its common stock under the share repurchase program upon the earlier of, among other things: (1) the date on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares equals $20 million including, without limitation, all applicable fees, costs and expenses; or (2) upon written notice by the Company to the broker that the share repurchase agreement is terminated. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares under the share repurchase program.
