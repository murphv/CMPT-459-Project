CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q (this “ Report ”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. We make forward-looking statements under the “ Risk Factors, ” “ Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and in other sections of this Report. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by the following words: “ anticipate, ” “ believe, ” “ continue, ”
“ could, ” “ estimate, ” “ expect, ” “ intend, ” “ may, ”
“ ongoing, ” “ plan, ” “ potential, ” “ predict, ” “ project, ”
“ should, ” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements
contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate
indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information
available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our
results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements in this Report.
You should read the matters
described in, and incorporated by reference in, “ Risk Factors ” and the other cautionary statements made in this Report,
as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking
statements in this Report will prove to be accurate and therefore prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements.
All forward-looking statements
speak only at the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future
events. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that our plans, intentions
and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward-looking statements we make in this Quarterly Report are reasonable, we provide
no assurance that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. We disclose important factors that could cause our actual
results to differ materially from our expectations under “ Risk Factors ” and “ Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on September 27, 2022. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking
statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking
statements except as required by law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Business
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description
of Business
– NeoVolta Inc. (“we”, “our” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation,
which was formed on March 5, 2018. The Company is a designer, seller and manufacturer of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) which can
store and use energy via batteries and an inverter at residential and commercial sites. The Company sells its proprietary ESS units
through wholesale customers, primarily in California, and in an expanding number of other states. In August 2022, the Company
completed an underwritten public offering of its equity securities resulting in its common stock and warrants becoming listed on a
national exchange (see Note 3).
Interim Financial Information
– The Company has prepared the accompanying financial statements, without audit, in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the Unites States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, these financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2022, the results
of its operations for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the changes in its stockholders’ equity
for the six month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and cash flows for the six month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 has been derived from the Company’s June 30, 2022 financial statements that were audited by
an independent registered public accounting firm but does not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete annual
financial statements. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30,
2022, as filed with the SEC on September 27, 2022.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
– The Company considers all highly liquid accounts with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to
be cash equivalents. Periodically, the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured
limit of $250,000. The amount in excess of the FDIC insurance at December 31, 2022 was $ 3,172,697 .
Inventory
– Inventory
consists of batteries and inverters purchased from Asian suppliers and delivered to a location near the Company’s offices, for assembly
into ESS units. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined using the first-in, first out
(FIFO) method. The following table presents the components of inventory as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022:

$ 2,238,208
The Company periodically reviews
the value of items in inventory and records an allowance to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable
value based on its assessment of market conditions, inventory turnover and current stock levels. Inventory write-downs are charged to
cost of goods sold.
No
inventory reserve was required as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
9
Revenue Recognition
– The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606). Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer in an amount that
reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those goods or services. Revenue is recognized
based on the following five step model:
· Identification of the contract with a customer
· Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
· Determination of the transaction price
· Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
· Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation
The Company generates revenues
from contracts with customers, consisting of a relatively small number of wholesale dealers and installers, primarily in California. Three
such dealers represented approximately
27 %,
19 % and
12 % of the Company’s revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2022, however,
no other dealers accounted for more than 10% of the revenues in such period. Two of those same two dealers represented an aggregate of
approximately
61 % of the Company’s accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 (net of allowance), however, no other dealers accounted
for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022. Four dealers represented approximately
17 %,
15 %,
13 % and
12 % of
the Company’s revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Since all of the Company’s revenue is currently generated
from the sales of similar products, no further disaggregation of revenue information for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
is provided.
Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts
– The Company recognizes an allowance for doubtful accounts whenever a loss is expected to be incurred in the
realization of a customer’s account. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 80,000
and zero, respectively.
Income Taxes
–
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of reported assets and liabilities and are measured
using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company must then assess
the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Company accounts for uncertain
tax positions in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740-10 which prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on its tax return.
The Company evaluates and records any uncertain tax positions based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination and ultimate settlement with the tax authorities in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
Stock Compensation Expense
– Employee and non-employee share-based payment compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award,
and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.
Loss Per Common Share
– Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total outstanding common stock equivalents of
1,529,750
shares as follows: (i)
1,121,250
shares
related to warrants issued to investors in the public offering completed in August 2022; (ii)
58,500
shares related to warrants issued
to the underwriters in that same offering; and (iii)
350,000
shares related to restricted stock units granted to two officers in March
2022 (see Note 3).
10
Research and Development
Costs
– Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Use of Estimates
–
Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As a result of the continued spread
of the COVID-19 coronavirus since early 2020, economic uncertainties have arisen which could impact business operations, supply chains,
energy demand, and commodity prices that are beyond our control. Overall, we have not experienced a material adverse impact to our economic
performance or ability to continue our business operations as a result of COVID-19. We continue to monitor COVID-19, but do not believe
it will have a material unfavorable impact to our future financial performance at this time.
Related Parties
- The
Company accounts for related party transactions in accordance with ASC 850. A party is considered to be related to the Company if the
party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company.
Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of
the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence
the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing
its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties
or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that it might
be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.
Fair
Value Measurements and Financial Instruments
- ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an
entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level
1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level
2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,
including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates);
and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level
3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.  The carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet
financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates
fair value since the related rate of interest approximates current market rates.
At December 31, 2022 and June
30, 2022, the Company did
no t have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s
balance sheets on a recurring basis.
11
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
– From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”),
or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the impact of recently
issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations
upon adoption. The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such
pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.
Liquidity
– These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern has been dependent upon the ability
of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. As disclosed in
Note 3, we completed a public offering of our equity securities in August 2022 that raised total net proceeds of approximately $3,780,000.
With the proceeds of this equity offering, we anticipate that we will have sufficient cash resources in order to operate our business
for at least the next 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued.
(2)         Notes
Payable
In conjunction with the closing
of our underwritten public offering in August 2022 (see Note 3), all holders of the Company’s two outstanding series of convertible
notes payable, which were originally issued to various accredited investors in May 2018 and October 2021, agreed to convert their debt
into a total of
9,671,867
shares of our common stock at the respective conversion rates. Each of these two series of our converted notes
payable is further described below.
In May 2018, we entered into
convertible note payable agreements with a group of accredited investors for aggregate proceeds of $104,688. Each unsecured note originally
bore interest at a rate of 12% per annum, which was later reduced by mutual agreement to 3.99% per annum in May 2019. Subsequently, the
holders of certain of these notes elected to convert or exchange certain portions of their convertible notes payable into shares of our
common stock, based upon the stated conversion rate of $0.0063 per share. As of the closing of our underwritten public offering in August
2022, the holders of the remaining balance of such unconverted notes in the total amount of $ 59,251 , including accrued interest, agreed
to convert their debt into a total of
9,404,867
shares of our common stock at the stated conversion rate of $ 0.0063
per share.
In October 2021, we entered
into convertible note payable agreements with a group of accredited investors for aggregate proceeds of $ 1,068,000 . Each unsecured note
bore interest at a rate of
6 % per annum. As of the closing of our underwritten public offering in August 2022, pursuant to the terms of
such convertible notes, the notes were automatically converted into a total of
267,000
shares of our common stock at the stated conversion
rate of $ 4.00
of principal per share.
(3)         Equity
Common Stock
–
In August 2022, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its equity securities in the form of Units with each Unit consisting
of one share of common stock and one warrant (each, a “Warrant” and collectively, the “Warrants”) to purchase
one share of common stock at an exercise price of $ 4.00
per share. The shares of common stock and the Warrants comprising the Units were
immediately separated at closing of the offering and each is now independently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Each Warrant became
exercisable on the date of issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance.
In the underwritten public
offering, a total of
1,121,250
Units, including exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option, were sold at an offering price
to the public of $ 4.00
per Unit. The gross proceeds of the offering were $ 4,485,000
and the net proceeds, after deduction of underwriting
discounts and other offering costs were approximately $ 3,780,000 . The Company also granted the underwriter non-tradeable warrants to purchase
a total of
58,500
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $ 4.40
per share for a period of five years.
12
In conjunction with the public
offering, all holders of the Company’s 2018 convertible notes in the total amount of $ 59,251 , including accrued interest, converted
their debt into a total of
9,404,867
shares of common stock at the stated conversion rate, and all holders of the Company’s 2021
convertible notes in the total amount of $ 1,068,000
converted their debt into a total of
267,000
shares of common stock at the stated
conversion rate (see Note 2).
In the six months ended December
31, 2021, the holders of the 2018 convertible notes payable having total principal and accrued interest balances in the aggregate amount
of $ 1,283
elected to convert their notes. Based upon the stated conversion price of $0.0063 per share, these holders converted their notes
payable into a total of
203,630
shares of common stock (see Note 2).
Warrants
–
The Warrants for a total of
1,179,750
shares of common stock issued to investors and the underwriters are exercisable at any time after their original issuance and at any
time up to the date that is five years after their original issuance, or August 1, 2027. The Warrants may be exercised upon payment
of the exercise price in cash on or prior to the expiration date. Under the terms of the Warrant Agreement, we must use our best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and current prospectus relating to common stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants until the expiration of the Warrants. If we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration
statement and current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, the holders of the Warrants
shall have the right to exercise the Warrants solely via a cashless exercise feature provided for in the Warrants, until such time
as there is an effective registration statement and current prospectus.

Stock Compensation Expense
–
In February 2022, we entered into a new employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective April
1, 2022. The initial term of the employment agreement is one year and is automatically renewable for additional one-year terms unless
either party chooses not to renew the agreement. The agreement provides for an initial annual salary of $165,000. Pursuant to the agreement,
we issued our CEO a restricted stock unit (“RSU”) award for up to 150,000 shares of our common stock upon achieving the following
milestones (which achievements shall be determined by the Board): (i) Milestone 1 - Successfully complete an uplisting of our common stock
in 2022 and continue his employment with our company until January 1, 2023: 50,000 shares; and (ii) Milestone 2 - Produce 2,000 ESSs in
2022 and continue his employment with our company until January 1, 2023: 100,000 shares. As of January 1, 2023, Milestone 1 was achieved,
however, Milestone 2 was not achieved. The underlying 50,000 shares of common stock earned under Milestone 1 were issued to the CEO as
of that date.
In February 2022, we entered
into a new employment agreement with our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), effective March 1, 2022. The initial term of the
employment agreement is one year and is automatically renewable for additional one-year terms unless either party chooses not to renew
the agreement. The agreement provides for an initial annual salary of $125,000. Pursuant to the agreement, we issued our CFO an RSU award
for up to 300,000 shares of our common stock upon achieving the following milestones (which achievements shall be determined by the Board):
(i) Milestone 1 - Successfully complete an uplisting of our common stock in 2022 and continue his employment with our company until January
1, 2023: 250,000 shares; and (ii) Milestone 2 - successfully complete and file the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended June 30,
2023 no later than September 29, 2023 and continue his employment with our company until January 1, 2024: 50,000 shares. Milestone 1 was
achieved as of January 1, 2023, and the underlying 250,000 shares of common stock earned under Milestone 1 were issued to the CFO as of
that date.
13
Based upon the Company’s
assessment of the probability of the CEO and CFO ultimately achieving each milestone specified under the RSU awards indicated above, the
Company has calculated the grant date value of such awards and is amortizing it as stock compensation expense over the underlying performance
periods. The Company has recognized stock compensation expense applicable to such RSU awards in the six months ended December 31, 2022
in the amount of $1,159,882.
In conjunction with our public
offering in August 2022, we appointed two new independent directors and adopted a new compensation plan for all independent directors
based on an annual compensation amount of $65,000 to be paid quarterly with not less than 70% of such amount paid in shares of our common
stock, calculated based on the share price at the end of such prior fiscal quarter, and up to 30% paid in cash, with such final amounts
to be determined by each director. As of December 31, 2022, we booked an initial accrual of $ 97,500
of compensation expense (of which
$87,750 will be settled through the issuance of shares) for our three independent directors under this plan. At the same time, we also
granted
26,000
shares, with a grant date value of $ 97,500 , to various advisors pursuant to annual contracts for their services. In the
six months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized total non-cash stock compensation expense of $ 1,311,111
as follows: (i) $ 1,159,882
for
the amortized value of the RSUs granted to our two executive officers, as previously described; (ii) $ 87,750
for the amortized value of
the portion of the new compensation plan for our independent directors that is attributable to stock; (iii) $ 48,750
for the amortized
value of the shares granted to various advisors under their annual service contracts; and (iv) $ 14,729
for the fair value of incentive
shares earned by a wholesale dealer as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 4). There was a total of
75,000
shares of common stock that were
issued to three grantees, a director and two advisory board members, in the six months ended December 31, 2022, which were previously
expensed in the year ended June 30, 2022.
In the six months ended December
31, 2021, the Company recognized non-cash stock compensation expense in the total amount of $ 4,001,558
as follows: (i) $ 3,505,000
for
the fair value of 500,000 incentive shares earned as of December 31, 2021 by a company controlled by the Company’s CEO under a previous
compensation plan (which were not issued until early 2022); (ii) $ 175,250
for the fair value of 25,000 bonus shares earned as of December
31, 2021 by an outside attorney (which were not issued until early 2022); (iii) $ 157,746
for the amortized value of 50,000 shares granted
to an attorney and a consultant pursuant to one year service agreements in mid 2021; (iv) $ 103,500
for the amortized value of 50,000 shares
attributable to a new independent director in early 2021; and (v) $ 60,062
for the fair value of 8,568 incentive shares earned by a wholesale
dealer as of December 31, 2021 (see Note 4). There was a total of 154,165 shares of common stock that were issued to various grantees,
primarily advisors, attorneys and consultants, in the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Other Matters
–
In February 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the establishment of a new 2019 Stock Plan (“Plan”) with
an authorization for the issuance of up to
2,500,000
shares of common stock. The Plan is designed to provide for future discretionary
grants of stock options, stock awards and stock unit awards to key employees, consultants, advisors, and non-employee directors. As of
December 31, 2022, the Company has made awards totaling
450,000
shares for the RSUs granted to two executives, as noted above, under the
Plan.
(4)        Commitments
and Contingencies
Effective January 1, 2021,
the Company secured new corporate and manufacturing office space under a sublease agreement with its contract manufacturer. Under the
terms of the sublease agreement, the Company is required to make rental payments of $10,350 per month during the initial one-year term
of the agreement. The sublease agreement is renewable upon mutual agreement of both parties for up to four additional years at a modest
increase in the monthly rent, however, the Company is under is no obligation to renew it. Management has determined that the exercise
of the renewal option is not reasonably certain and, as such, the Company has accounted for it as a short-term lease under ASC 842,
Leases .
Effective January 1, 2023, the Company elected to renew the agreement for another one year period.
As indicated in Note 1, the
Company sells its proprietary ESS units through wholesale dealers, primarily in California. In that regard, the Company has entered into
agreements with several wholesale dealers operating in California and other states under which the Company has incentivized the dealers
to achieve quarterly sales above targeted levels by agreeing to grant them shares of the Company’s common stock for exceeding such
quarterly sales targets, subject to defined maximums.
14
From time to time in the ordinary
course of our business, the Company may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The Company is
not involved in any legal proceedings at this time. The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether
meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in
diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal
matters for which losses are not probable and estimable.
(5)         Subsequent Events
As of January 1, 2023, we
issued a total of 300,000 shares of common stock to our two executive officers in recognition of each officer having achieved Milestone
1 under their respective Board approved RSU awards (see Note 3).

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Introduction
This information should be

Overview
We are a designer, manufacturer,
and seller of high-end Energy Storage Systems (or ESS), primarily our NeoVolta NV14 and NV 24, which can store and use energy via batteries
and an inverter at residential or commercial sites. We were founded to identify new ways to leverage emerging technologies with the dynamic
changes that are taking place in the energy delivery space. We primarily market and sell our products directly to our certified solar
installers and solar equipment distributors. We are also pursuing agreements with residential developers, commercial developers, and other
commercial opportunities. Because we are purely dedicated to energy solar systems, virtually all of our current resources and efforts
go into further developing our flagship NV14 and NV 24 products, while focusing on specific industry needs for our next generation of
products. We believe we are unique in the marketplace due to our low cost, our innovative battery chemistry, our product versatility and
our commitment to installer service. Because of these factors, we believe NeoVolta is uniquely equipped to establish itself as a major
player in the energy storage market.
In May 2019, we completed
a public offering of 3,500,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $1.00 per share for gross proceeds of $3.5 million pursuant
to Regulation A of the Securities Act.. We used the proceeds of the offering to ramp up production, marketing, and sales of our NV14 product
line. In that regard, we have used the proceeds from the offering to fund the marketing, production and distribution of our products,
which commenced in July 2019 through a group of wholesale customers in California, as well as to provide additional working capital for
other corporate purposes. We have expanded to include one wholesale distribution customer in Nevada. As of the current date, we have had
successful installations of our products in the additional States of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Utah, Florida, Puerto Rico, Oklahoma, Texas,
Colorado, Wyoming, Tennessee, and Missouri.
As further discussed below
under “Underwritten Public Offering,” we completed an underwritten public offering of our equity securities in the form of
Units in August 2022. We sold a total of 1,121,250 Units in the offering at an offering price to the public of $4.00 per Unit. The gross
proceeds of the offering were $4,485,000 and the net proceeds, after deduction of underwriting discounts and other offering costs, were
approximately $3,780,000. We are using the proceeds of this public offering to increase our current production capacity, expand our product
portfolio, enlarge our product marketing and sales efforts, and for other general corporate purposes.
16
Underwritten Public Offering
In early August 2022, we completed
an underwritten public offering of our equity securities in the form of Units with each Unit consisting of one share of common stock and
one warrant (the “Warrants”) to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00 per share. The shares of
common stock and the Warrants comprising the Units were immediately separated at closing of the offering and each is now independently
listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “NEOV” and “NEOVW,” respectively. Each Warrant became exercisable
on the date of issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance.
Between the initial closing
of the offering and the underwriters’ exercise of the overallotment option, we sold a total of 1,121,250 Units in the offering at
an offering price to the public of $4.00 per Unit. The gross proceeds of the offering, including the underwriters’ exercise of the
overallotment option, were $4,485,000 and the net proceeds, after deduction of underwriting discounts and other offering costs, were approximately
$3,780,000. We are using the proceeds of this public offering to increase our current production capacity, expand our product portfolio,
enlarge our product marketing and sales efforts, and for other general corporate purposes.
In conjunction with the public
offering, all holders of the Company’s 2018 convertible notes in the total amount of $59,251, including accrued interest, converted
their debt into a total of 9,404,867 shares of common stock at the stated conversion rate, and all holders of the Company’s 2021
convertible notes in the total amount of $1,068,000 converted their debt into a total of 267,000 shares of common stock at the stated
conversion rate. As a result of the simultaneous conversion of both sets of convertible notes, the Company has fully eliminated its convertible
debt.
Results of Operations
The following discussion
reflects the Company’s revenues and expenses for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as reported in
our financial statements included in Item 1.
Three months ended December 31, 2022 versus
three months ended December 31, 2021
Revenues
- Revenues
from contracts with customers for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $567,105 compared to $1,035,127 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021. Such decrease was primarily due to
the pendency of the April 2023 effective date
of new utility regulations in the State of California that we believe is presently causing an economic disincentive for residential utility
customers to acquire our
energy storage systems prior to the effective date of those regulations (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
for a discussion of the new utility regulations).
Cost of Goods Sold
- Cost of goods sold for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $473,159 compared to $861,706 for the three months ended December
31, 2021. The cost of goods sold in both periods reflected the cost of procuring and assembling the component parts of the energy storage
systems that were sold in each fiscal year and resulted in gross profits on such sales of approximately 17% in both periods.
General and Administrative
Expense
- General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $1,073,729 compared to $4,137,495
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Such decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the expense recorded for the fair value
of incentive shares of common stock earned by the Company’s executive officers under their new employment contracts, effective in
March 2022.
Research and Development
Expense
- Research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $7,746 compared to $62,250 for the three
months ended December 31, 2021. Such fluctuation was due to a decrease in the level of the Company’s recent product development
efforts.
Interest Expense
-
Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was zero compared to $3,530 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
This decrease resulted from the conversion of our 2018 and 2021 convertible notes in conjunction with the closing of our public offering
in August 2022.
17
Net Loss
- Net loss
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $987,529 compared to $4,029,854 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, representing
the aggregate of the various revenue and expense categories indicated above. The Company has not recognized any income tax benefit for
these net losses due to the uncertainty of its ultimate realization.
Six months ended December 31, 2022 versus six
months ended December 31, 2021
Revenues
- Revenues
from contracts with customers for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $2,104,941 compared to $2,634,731 for the six months ended
December 31, 2021. Such decrease was primarily due to
the pendency of the April 2023 effective date
of new utility regulations in the State of California that we believe is presently causing an economic disincentive for residential utility
customers to acquire our
energy storage systems prior to the effective date of those regulations (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
for a discussion of the new utility regulations).
Cost of Goods Sold
- Cost of goods sold for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $1,765,119 compared to $2,222,700 for the six months ended December
31, 2021. The cost of goods sold in both periods reflected the cost of procuring and assembling the component parts of the energy storage
systems that were sold in each fiscal year and resulted in gross profits on such sales of approximately 16% in both periods.
General and Administrative
Expense
- General and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $1,993,157 compared to $4,494,053 for
the six months ended December 31, 2021. Such decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the expense recorded for the fair value of
incentive shares of common stock earned by the Company’s executive officers under their new employment contracts, effective in March
2022.
Research and Development
Expense
- Research and development expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $28,646 compared to $66,503 for the six
months ended December 31, 2021. Such fluctuation was due to a decrease in the level of the Company’s recent product development
efforts.
Interest Expense
-
Interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $4,134 compared to $9,536 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
This decrease resulted from the conversion of our 2018 and 2021 convertible notes in conjunction with the closing of our public offering
in August 2022.
Net Loss
- Net loss
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $1,686,115 compared to $4,158,061 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, representing
the aggregate of the various revenue and expense categories indicated above. The Company has not recognized any income tax benefit for
these net losses due to the uncertainty of its ultimate realization.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Operating activities.
Net cash used in operating activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $688,093, compared to $475,923 in the six months ended
December 31, 2021, reflecting a modest increase in net working capital requirements in the current fiscal year period.
Financing activities .
Net cash provided by financing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $3,780,405, compared to $1,068,000 in the six
months ended December 31, 2021. As further discussed below, our net cash provided by financing activities in the six months ended December
31, 2022 was entirely attributable to the successful completion of an underwritten public offering of our equity securities in early August
2022. Our net cash provided by financing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2021 resulted from the issuance of our convertible
notes payable to a group of accredited investors in October 2021 in the amount of $1,068,000. Such notes were ultimately converted into
common stock in conjunction with the closing of our public offering in August 2022.
We completed an underwritten
public offering of our equity securities in the form of Units in early August 2022. Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and
one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00 per share. We sold a total of 1,121,250 Units in the offering
at an offering price to the public of $4.00 per Unit. The gross proceeds of the offering, including the underwriters’ exercise of
the overallotment option, were $4,485,000 and the net proceeds, after deduction of underwriting discounts and other offering costs, were
approximately $3,780,000.
18
In conjunction with the public
offering, all holders of our 2018 convertible notes in the total amount of $59,251, including accrued interest, converted their debt into
a total of 9,404,867 shares of common stock at the stated conversion rate, and all holders of our 2021 convertible notes in the total
amount of $1,068,000 converted their debt into a total of 267,000 shares of common stock at the stated conversion rate. As a result of
the simultaneous conversion of both sets of convertible notes, the Company has fully eliminated its convertible debt.
As of December 31, 2022, we
had a cash balance of $3.4 million and net working capital of approximately $7.2 million. Currently, we are not generating a break-even
level of net operating cash flow from our net sales. However, we anticipate that demand for our products will ultimately increase over
time and that we will have sufficient cash to operate for at least the next 12 months.
Recent Developments
As a result of the continued
spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus since early 2020, economic uncertainties have arisen which could impact business operations, supply
chains, energy demand, and commodity prices that are beyond our control. In calendar year 2022, we have experienced some negative impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sales of our assembled energy storage systems, primarily through a group of wholesale dealers and installers
located in California. We continue to monitor COVID-19, but do not believe it will have a material unfavorable impact to our future financial
performance at this time.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based on financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We believe that certain accounting policies affect our
more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. See “Note 1. Business and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Financial Statements set forth above and under “Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on September 27,
2022, for a further description of our critical accounting policies and estimates.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Information for this Item
is not required as the Registrant is a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
We have established and maintain
a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer, who is
our principal financial and accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
As of December 31, 2022, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as a result of the material weakness relating to the lack of segregation of duties, our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report were not effective. Due to our size and
nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. We will be required to
hire additional personnel in order to remediate our material weakness.
19
Changes in internal controls over financial
reporting
There was no change in our
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures
In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and
procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
20
PART II.      OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Although we may, from time
to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, we are not currently a party
to any material legal proceeding. In addition, we are not aware of any material legal or governmental proceedings against us, or contemplated
to be brought against us.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
There have been no material
changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on September 27, 2022 (the “Form 10-K”), under the heading “Risk Factors”,
except as set forth below, which are incorporated by reference herein and investors should review the risks provided in the Form 10-K
prior to making an investment in the Company. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by
a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in the Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2022, under “Risk Factors”, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual
financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating
results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition,
operating results and stock price.
The following are new risk
factors which supplements the risk factors included in our Form 10-K:
Recent utility regulations
enacted in the State of California in December 2022 are currently having a negative impact on the sales of our energy storage systems
in that state.
On December 15, 2022, t he
California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) unanimously passed a new statewide utility regulation known as Net Energy
Metering 3.0 (“NEM 3.0”). This new regulation will become effective
in 120 days after enactment, on April 14, 2023,
and will significantly alter the net billing rates for residential solar production in the State of California
and
ultimately impact the monthly energy bill savings for homeowners . We believe that the passage of NEM 3.0 will provide a significant
economic incentive for residential utility customers to acquire energy storage systems,
such as
those sold by NeoVolta, once NEM 3.0 becomes effective on April 14, 2023. In the meantime, however, there is an impediment for residential
utility customers to acquire our
energy storage systems , which are presently being grandfathered
under a similar new regulation for solar panels, until the purchasing and installation of batteries can occur in advance of NEM 3.0 becoming
effective on April 14, 2023. Therefore, we expect the negative impact that we are currently experiencing on our sales in the
State
of California
to possibly continue through at least the first calendar quarter of 2023.
An increase in mortgage
interest rates may result in a decrease in demand by homeowners for our residential energy storage systems.
Sales volume in our homeowner
channel is partially dependent on the construction of new homes and the sale of existing homes in our residential markets. Many customers
of our installation partners rely on mortgage loans from banks and other lenders in order to finance a substantial portion of the purchase
price for their home, including any related improvements. Increased mortgage interest rates may lead to lower demand for new homes and
a reduced number of homes available for solar origination through our homeowner channel. Additionally, increased interest rates may result
in fewer secondary home sales, a reduction in the number of customers refinancing their mortgages and uncertainty about the economy.
