INMED PHARMACEUTICALS INC.
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
(Expressed in U.S. Dollars)
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION AND CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Business
InMed Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (“InMed” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the Province of British Columbia on May 19, 1981 under the
Business Corporations Act
of British Columbia. InMed is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of prescription-based
products, including rare cannabinoids and novel cannabinoid analogs, targeting the treatment of diseases with high unmet medical needs
as well as developing proprietary manufacturing technologies to produce rare cannabinoids for sale in the health and wellness industry.
The Company’s shares are listed
on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “INM”. InMed’s office and principal place
of business is located at #310 – 815 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, B.C., Canada, V6C 1B4.
Liquidity
Through December 31, 2022, the Company
has funded its operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of common stock. The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative
cash flows from operations since its inception, including net losses of approximately $ 5.6
million and $ 7.3
million for the six months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $ 99.1
million at
December 31, 2022. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future.
As of the issuance date of these condensed
consolidated interim financial statements, the Company expects its cash and cash equivalents of $ 11.5
million as of December 31, 2022
will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the last quarter of calendar 2023, depending on the level and timing of realizing revenues from the sale of BayMedica inventory
as well as the level and timing of the Company operating expenses. The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to
raise additional capital to finance its operations. As a result of the recurring losses and requirement for cash in the last quarter of
calendar 2023 or the first quarter of calendar 2024, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued.
The Company expects to continue to
seek additional funding through equity financings, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies,
government contracts or other strategic transactions. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all.
The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company’s existing shareholders.
These condensed consolidated interim
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its commitments,
realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not
reflect adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities that would be necessary if the Company was unable to continue as
a going concern and such adjustments could be material.
COVID-19 Impacts
The full extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic may directly or indirectly impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including expenses,
research and development costs and employee-related amounts, will depend on future developments that are evolving and highly uncertain,
such as the duration and severity of outbreaks, including potential future waves or cycles, and the effectiveness of actions taken to
contain and treat COVID-19. The Company considered the potential impact of COVID-19 when making certain estimates and judgments relating
to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. While there was no material impact to the Company’s condensed consolidated
interim financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s future assessment of
the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in a material impact to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements in future reporting periods.

FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
(Expressed in U.S. Dollars)
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
These unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in
the United States (“US GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) for financial information. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes
required for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company and the accompanying notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2022.
These unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion
of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three
and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results that can be expected for a full year. These
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements follow the same significant accounting policies as those described in the
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended June 30, 2022.
The functional currency
of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in U.S.
Dollars. References to “$” and “US$” are to United States (“U.S.”) dollars and references to “C$”
are to Canadian dollars.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements
in compliance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
as of the balance sheet date, and the corresponding revenues and expenses for the periods reported. It also requires management to exercise
judgment in applying the Company’s accounting policies. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to these consolidated
financial statements are the estimate of useful life of intangible assets, the application of the going concern assumption, and determining
the fair value of share-based payments and warrants.

Short-term investments include guaranteed
investment certificates, with one year terms, of $ 43,053
(June 30, 2022 - $ 44,676 ) that are pledged as security for a corporate credit
card.
The Company has entered into certain
agreements in the ordinary course of operations that may include indemnification provisions, which are common in such agreements. In some
cases, the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company currently holds commercial general liability
insurance. This insurance limits the Company’s liability and may enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
Historically, the Company has not made any indemnification payments under such agreements and it believes that the fair value of these
indemnification obligations is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized any liabilities relating to these obligations for
any period presented.
Pursuant to a technology licensing
agreement, the Company is committed to issue, subject to regulatory approval, up to
700
warrants to purchase
700
common shares upon the
achievement of certain milestones. The exercise price of the warrants will be equal to the five-day VWAP of the common shares prior to
each milestone achievement and the warrants will be exercisable for a period of three years for issuance date.
BayMedica LLC (“BayMedica”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a patent license agreement (“Agreement”) with a third party (the “Licensor”)
in an agreement dated February 15, 2021. The Company is required to make future royalty payments to the Licensor based on net sales of
licensed products, with minimum payments required starting in 2021. In December 2021, the Company amended the License Agreement including
the deferral of the 2021 minimum payments to 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has paid $ 300,000
for the minimum payments under
the agreement. On February 10, 2023, BayMedica received a letter from the Licensor alleging a breach of the Agreement and asserting a
right to monies thereunder. BayMedica disputes the Licensor’s interpretation of the Agreement and considers the counterparty’s
only remedy under the Agreement to be the conversion of an exclusive technology license into a non-exclusive one. To date, the Licensor
has not initiated a lawsuit. If a lawsuit is brought alleging a breach of the Agreement, the proceeding will be subject to final, binding
and non-appealable arbitration under the
Arbitration Act, 1991
(Ontario) and determined pursuant to Ontario law. BayMedica intends
to vigorously defend its position. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate a potential loss due to the terms of the Agreement,
the nature of the legal theory advanced by the counterparty, and the requirement under Ontario law that a contract must be interpreted
in light of the “surrounding circumstances” at the time the contract was formed. Management will be better positioned to determine
whether it is possible to estimate any potential loss following documentary and oral discovery, if any.
From time to time, the Company may
be subject to various legal proceedings and claims related to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not
believe it is currently subject to any material matters where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may be incurred.

FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
(Expressed in U.S. Dollars)
15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company’s financial instruments
consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
The fair values of short-term investments,
accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs.
a) Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk that the fair
value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market prices are comprised of
four types of risk: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk and equity price risk. The Company does not currently
have significant commodity price risk or equity price risk.
Foreign Currency Risk :
Foreign currency risk is the risk
that the future cash flows or fair value of the Company’s financial instruments that are denominated in a currency that is not the
Company’s functional currency (U.S. dollar) will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Portions of the Company’s
cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities are denominated in Canadian dollars.
Accordingly, the Company is exposed
to fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily against the Canadian dollar.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company
has a net excess of Canadian dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents in excess of Canadian dollar denominated accounts payable and
accrued liabilities of C$ 1,551,470
which is equivalent to US$ 1,145,450
at the December 31, 2022 exchange rate. The Canadian dollar financial
assets generally result from holding Canadian dollar cash to settle anticipated near-term accounts payable and accrued liabilities denominated
in Canadian dollars. The Canadian dollar financial liabilities generally result from purchases of supplies and services from suppliers
in Canada.
Each increase (decrease) of
1 % in
the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar results in a gain (loss), with a corresponding effect on cash flows, of $ 11,455
based
on the December 31, 2022 net Canadian dollar assets (liabilities) position. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
recorded foreign exchange loss of $ 84,384
(2021 – $ 72,619 ) related to Canadian dollars.

(Expressed in U.S. Dollars)
15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (cont’d)
a) Market Risk (cont’d):
Interest Rate Risk:
Interest rate risk is the risk that
future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, holdings of cash and cash equivalents
of $ 11,023,864
(June 30, 2022 - $ 5,087,615 ) are subject to floating interest rates. The balance of the Company’s cash holdings of
$ 428,714
(June 30, 2022 - $ 1,089,251 ) are non-interest bearing.
As at December 31, 2022, the Company
held variable rate guaranteed investment certificates, with one-year terms, of $ 43,053
(June 30, 2022 - $ 44,676 ).
The Company’s current policy
is to invest excess cash in guaranteed investment certificates or interest-bearing accounts of major Canadian chartered banks or credit
unions with comparable credit ratings. The Company regularly monitors compliance to its cash management policy.
b) Credit Risk:
Credit risk is the risk of financial
loss to the Company if a customer or a counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments
which are potentially subject to credit risk for the Company consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and
loan receivable. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and
may be redeemed upon demand. In the normal course of business, the Company does not provide third party loans.
The carrying amount of financial assets
represents the maximum credit exposure. Credit risk exposure is limited through maintaining cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
with high-credit quality financial institutions and management considers this risk to be minimal for all cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments assets based on changes that are reasonably possible at each reporting date.
c) Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the
Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient
cash to meet its liabilities when they become due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Company’s reputation. A key risk in managing liquidity is the degree of uncertainty in the cash flow projections.
If future cash flows are fairly uncertain, the liquidity risk increases. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments of $ 11,495,631
(June 30, 2022 - $ 6,221,670 ), current liabilities of $ 2,400,743
(June 30, 2022 - $ 3,181,316 )
and a working capital surplus of $ 11,616,972
(June 30, 2022 - $ 6,416,460 ).
16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On February 11, 2022, the Board of

Overview
We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company
developing a pipeline of prescription-based products, including rare cannabinoids and novel cannabinoid analogs, targeting the treatment
of diseases with high unmet medical needs (“Product Candidates”). Together with our subsidiary BayMedica, LLC, we also have
significant know-how in developing proprietary manufacturing approaches to produce cannabinoids for various market sectors (“Products”).
Our know-how includes traditional approaches such as chemical synthesis and biosynthesis, as well as a proprietary, integrated manufacturing
approach called IntegraSyn TM . We are dedicated to delivering new therapeutic alternatives to patients and consumers who may
benefit from cannabinoid-based products. Our approach leverages on the several thousand years’ history of health benefits attributed
to the
Cannabis
plant and brings this anecdotal information into the 21st century by applying tried, tested and true scientific
approaches to establish non-plant-derived (synthetically manufactured), individual cannabinoid compounds as Product Candidates in important
market segments including clinically proven, FDA-approved medicines and Products that are provided to wholesalers and end-product manufacturers.
While our activities do not involve direct use of
Cannabis
nor extracts from the plant, we note that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) has, to date, not approved any marketing application for
Cannabis
for the treatment of any disease or condition
and has approved only one
Cannabis -derived and three
Cannabis -related drug products. Our ingredients are synthetically
made and, therefore, we have no interaction with the
Cannabis
plant. We do not grow nor utilize
Cannabis
nor its extracts
in any of our Products or Product Candidates; our current pharmaceutical drug Product Candidates are applied topically (not inhaled nor
ingested); and, we do not utilize THC or CBD, the most common cannabinoid compounds that are typically extracted from the
Cannabis
plant, in any of our Products or Product Candidates. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) under development for
our initial two drug candidates, INM-755 for Epidermolysis bullosa (“EB”) and INM-088 for glaucoma, is cannabinol (“CBN”).
Additional uses of both INM-755 and INM-088 are being explored, as well as the application of novel cannabinoid analogs to treat diseases
including but not limited to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s.
23
InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
We believe we are positioned to develop multiple
pharmaceutical Product Candidates in diseases which may benefit from medicines based on rare cannabinoid compounds. Most currently approved
cannabinoid therapies are based specifically on CBD and/or THC and are often delivered orally, which has limitations and drawbacks, such
as side effects (including the intoxicating effects of THC). Currently, we intend to deliver our rare cannabinoid pharmaceutical drug
candidates through various topical formulations (cream for dermatology, eye drops for ocular diseases) as a way of enabling treatment
of the specific disease at the site of disease while seeking to minimize systemic exposure and any related unwanted systemic side effects,
including any drug-drug interactions and any metabolism of the active pharmaceutical ingredient by the liver. The cannabinoid Products
sold through our B2B raw material supply business are integrated into various product formats by the companies who then further commercializes
such products. We access rare cannabinoids via all non-extraction approaches, including chemical synthesis, biosynthesis and our proprietary
integrated IntegraSyn TM
approach, thus negating any interaction with or exposure to the
Cannabis
plant.
Since our acquisition of Biogen Sciences Inc.,
a privately held British Columbia pharmaceutical company focused on drug discovery and development of cannabinoids in 2014, our operations
have focused on conducting research and development for our Product Candidates and for our integrated, biosynthesis-based manufacturing
technology, establishing our intellectual property, organizing and staffing our Company, business planning and capital raising. On October
13, 2021, we acquired BayMedica, Inc., now named BayMedica, LLC (“BayMedica”). Upon closing of the transaction, BayMedica
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of InMed. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common shares.
We have incurred significant operating losses
since our inception and since the acquisition of Biogen Science Inc. and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for
the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate product revenue, if ever, that is sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily
on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates and/or the success of our manufacturing
technologies. Our net loss was $5.6 million and $7.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of
December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $99.1 million, which includes all losses since our inception in 1981. Our accumulated
deficit increased between 2014, when we began focusing on the development of cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals following the acquisition
of Biogen Science Inc., and December 31, 2022 by approximately $70.2 million. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase
substantially over the next several years in connection with our ongoing activities as we:
●
continue to further advance
the INM-755 program, our lead drug candidate for the treatment of EB;
●
continue to further advance
the INM-088 program, our drug candidate for the treatment of glaucoma;
● continue
to advance research in the INM-900 series program, using rare cannabinoids in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s,
Huntington’s and Parkinson’s;
● investigate
our Product Candidates for additional uses beyond the initial indications;
●
pursue
the discovery of drug targets based on proprietary cannabinoid analogs for other diseases with high unmet medical needs and the subsequent
development of any resulting new Product Candidates;
●
seek regulatory
approvals for any Product Candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
● scale-up our manufacturing processes and capabilities, or
arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf;
● continue to support our commercial operations at BayMedica
● execute
on business development activities, including but not limited to company mergers/acquisitions and acquisition or in-licensing of externally
developed products and/or technologies;
● maintain, expand, enforce, defend and protect our intellectual
property;
● continue to further advance the research and development
of various manufacturing technologies;
● build
internal infrastructure, including personnel, to meet our milestones; and
●
add operational, financial and management
information systems and personnel, including personnel to support product development and potential future commercialization efforts
and our operations as a public company.
24
InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
As a result of these activities as well as our
working capital requirements, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth
strategy. We expect to finance our operations through product sales, the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including
collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other
agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and
when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our
Products and Product Candidates or grant rights to external entities to develop and market our Product Candidates, even if we would otherwise
prefer to develop and market such Products and Product Candidates ourselves.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties
associated with drug development and commercial growth, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses and working
capital requirements or the timing of when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. If we fail to become profitable
or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and
be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
Recent Developments
On November 21, 2022, we closed a $6.0 million
private placement. Under the terms of the private placement, an aggregate of 1,818,185 common shares, or common share equivalents, and
preferred investment options (“PIO”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,272,733 common shares, at an effective purchase
price of $3.30 per common share and associated PIO. The PIOs have an exercise price of $3.044 per share, are exercisable immediately
and have a term of seven years. After deducting the placement agent fees, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $5.4 million.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Our revenue consists of manufacturing and distribution
sales of bulk rare cannabinoid Products, which are generally recognized at a point in time. The Company recognizes revenue when control
over the products have been transferred to the customer and the Company has a present right to payment.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales consist
primarily of the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, freight costs, warehousing costs, and purchasing costs. Cost
of sales also includes production and labor costs for our manufacturing business.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development and Patent Expenses
Research and development and patent expenses
represent costs incurred by us for the discovery, development, and manufacture of our Products and Product Candidates and include:
●
external
research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or “CROs”, contract
development and manufacturing organization, or “CDMOs”, and consultants;
●
salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits
expenses for individuals involved in research and development efforts;
●
research supplies; and
●
legal
and patent office fees related to patent and intellectual property matters.
We expense research and development costs as
incurred. We recognize expenses for certain development activities, such as preclinical studies and manufacturing, based on an evaluation
of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data or other information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities
are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of expenses incurred. Non-refundable advance payments
for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. These
amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected
that the goods will be delivered, or the services rendered.
25
InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
External costs represent a significant portion
of our research and development expenses, which we track on a program-by-program basis following the nomination of a development candidate.
Our internal research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based
compensation expense. We do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as the resources are
deployed across multiple projects.
The successful development of our Products and
Product Candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of
the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our Product Candidates or to develop and commercialize
additional Products. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our Product Candidates,
if approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with development, including the uncertainty related to:
●
the timing
and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
● the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs
we decide to pursue;
● our
ability to raise additional funds necessary to complete preclinical and clinical development and commercialization of our Product Candidates,
to further advance the development of our manufacturing technologies, and to develop and commercialize additional Products, if any;
●
our ability
to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
● our ability to establish sales, licensing or collaboration
arrangements;
● the
progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements;
● the
successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the
FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
●
the receipt
and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
●
the availability
of materials for use in production of our Products and Product Candidates;
● our
ability to secure manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties or establish and operate a manufacturing facility;
● our
ability to consistently manufacture our Product Candidates in quantities sufficient for use in clinical trials;
● our
ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;
● our ability to maintain, enforce, defend and protect our
rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
● the
commercialization of our Product Candidates, if and when approved, and of new Products;
● our
ability to obtain and maintain third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement for our Product Candidates, if approved;
26
InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
● the
acceptance of our Product Candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;
● competition
with other products; and
● a
continued acceptable safety profile of our Product Candidates following receipt of any regulatory approvals.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables
with respect to the development of any of our Products or Product Candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated
with the development of those Products or Product Candidates.
Research and development activities account for
a significant portion of our operating expenses. During the first half of fiscal 2023, research and development expenses has decreased
as our INM-755 program progressed from preclinical toxicology studies into the relatively less capital intense early human clinical trials.
However, we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in future periods as we continue to implement our business
strategy, which includes advancing our drug candidates and our manufacturing technologies into and through clinical development, expanding
our research and development efforts, including hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts, ultimately
seeking regulatory approvals for our drug candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, and further developing selected BayMedica
activities. In addition, drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally incur higher development costs than those in
earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Accordingly,
although we expect our research and development expenses to increase as our drug candidates advance into later stages of clinical development,
we do not believe that it is possible, at this time, to accurately project total program-specific expenses through to commercialization.
There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our Product Candidates, including future trial design
and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist of
personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for our personnel in executive, finance and
accounting, human resources, business operations and other administrative functions, investor relations activities, legal fees related
to corporate matters, fees paid for accounting and tax services, consulting fees and facility-related costs.
Amortization and Depreciation
Intangible assets are comprised of intellectual
property that we acquired in 2014 and 2015 and trade secrets, product formulation knowledge, patents that we acquired in October 2021.
The acquired intellectual property and patents are amortized on a straight-line basis based on their estimated useful lives. Equipment
and leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We assess the recoverability of our long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of the long-lived asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset or assets. If carrying value exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows, we then determine the fair value
of the underlying asset. Any impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds
the estimated fair value of the asset group. Assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
value, less costs to sell.
Share-based Payments
Share-based payments is the stock-based compensation
expense related to our granting of stock options to employees and others. The fair value, at the grant date, of equity-settled share
awards is charged to our loss over the period for which the benefits of employees and others providing similar services are expected
to be received. The vesting components of graded vesting employee awards are measured separately and expensed over the related tranche’s
vesting period. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options expected to vest. The fair value
of awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which considers the exercise price, current market price of the
underlying shares, expected life of the award, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and the dividend yield.
Other Income
Other income consists primarily of interest income
earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Results of Operations
As of the closing of the BayMedica acquisition,
the Company aligned into two operating and reportable segments, InMed Pharmaceuticals (the “InMed” segment) and BayMedica
(the “BayMedica” segment).

decreased by $1.4 million in our InMed segment, or 70%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease in research and development and patents expenses was due to a combination of lower legal fees, personnel
expenses and decreased expenses related to the INM-755 program as we progressed from preclinical toxicology studies into the relatively
less capital intense early human clinical trials.

Sales increased by $0.2 million in our BayMedica
segment, or 77%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in distribution
sales results from expanded marketing efforts to sell inventory on-hand. In addition, we acquired BayMedica on October 13, 2021 so the
three months ended December 31, 2021 results were approximately 2 and a half months. BayMedica will continue to evaluate opportunities for potential
structured supply arrangements and collaborations and will consider other potential strategic alternatives for the commercial business.
Cost of Sales
Cost of goods sold increased by $0.2 million
in our BayMedica segment, or 120%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in cost of goods sold is a result from the increase in sales mentioned above.

Sales
Sales increased by $0.5 million in our BayMedica
segment, or 198%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in distribution
sales results from expanded marketing efforts to sell inventory on-hand in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In addition, we acquired
BayMedica on October 13, 2021 so the six months ended December 31, 2021 results were approximately 2 and a half months. BayMedica will continue to evaluate
opportunities for potential structured supply arrangements and collaborations and will consider other potential strategic alternatives

Cost of Sales
Cost of goods sold increased by $0.4 million
in our BayMedica segment, or 273%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The
increase in cost of goods sold is a result from the increase in sales mentioned above.
Inventory Write-Down
The write-down of inventories to net realizable
value was $0.6 million in our BayMedica segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022, with no comparable expenses in 2021. Contributing
factors to the decrease in net realizable value included lower demand and downward pricing pressure in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
Research and Development and Patents Expenses
Research and development and patents expenses
increased by less than $0.1 million in our BayMedica segment, or 1%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months
ended December 31, 2021. The increase in research and development and patents expenses was due to the inclusion of BayMedica operating
results following the acquisition date on October 13, 2021. There were no comparable expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses increased
by $0.6 million in our BayMedica segment, or 212%, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December
31, 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to the inclusion of BayMedica operating results following the acquisition
date on October 13, 2021. There were no comparable expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have only generated limited
revenue from Product sales, no sales from any other sources and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from
our operations. We have only commenced commercial sales with the acquisition of BayMedica and not yet commercialized any of our Product
Candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any Product Candidates for several years, if at all. We have funded
our operations to date primarily with proceeds from the sale of common shares.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments of $11.5 million.
The following table summarizes our cash flows
for each of the periods presented:

During the six months ended December 31, 2021,
we used cash in operating activities of $6.2 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $7.3 million combined with $0.6 million
used in changes in our non-cash working capital, partially offset by non-cash share-based compensation expenses.
Investing Activities
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
cash used in investing activities of $0.5 million resulted from escrow payments made to BayMedica’s historical equity and convertible
debt holders.

InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
During the six months ended December 31, 2021,
cash provided by investing activities of less than $0.1 million resulted from cash acquired from the acquisition of BayMedica, partially
offset by purchases of property and equipment.
Financing Activities
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
cash provided by financing activities of $10.7 million consisted of $12.0 million of gross proceeds from private placements of our common
shares, offset by total transaction costs of $1.3 million.
During the six months ended December 31, 2021,
cash provided by financing activities of $10.0 million consisted of $12.0 million of gross proceeds from a private placement of our common
shares, offset by transaction costs of $1.3 million and settlement of debt of $0.4 million reflecting the value of loans to BayMedica
as at the date of acquisition and $0.2 million for the repayment of debt assumed in the BayMedica acquisition.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially
in connection with our ongoing research and development activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of and the
clinical trials for our Product Candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a US-listed
public company and associated with any required investment into BayMedica’s R&D efforts targeting cannabinoid analogs. As a
result, we expect to incur substantial operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future.
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are issued.
Through December 31, 2022, we have funded our
operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of common stock. We have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations
since its inception, including net losses of $5.6 million and $7.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In addition, we have an accumulated deficit of $99.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Our accumulated deficit increased between 2014,
when we began focusing on the development of cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals following the acquisition of Biogen Science Inc., and
December 31, 2022 by approximately $70.2 million and we expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future.
As of the issuance date of the condensed consolidated
interim financial statements, we expect our cash and cash equivalents of $11.5 million as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund
our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the last quarter of calendar 2023, depending on the level and timing of realizing revenues from the sale of BayMedica inventory as well as the level and
timing of the Company operating expenses. Our future viability is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our
operations. In addition, there are a number of uncertainties in estimating our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
including the impact of potential acquisitions.
As a result, we have concluded that there is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements are issued.
33
InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
We expect to continue to seek additional funding
through equity financings, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies, government contracts
or other strategic transactions. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may
adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our existing stockholders.
Our funding requirements and timing and amount
of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:
● the
progress, costs and results of our Phase 2 clinical trial for INM-755;
● the
scope, progress, results and costs of discovery research, preclinical development, laboratory
testing and clinical trials for our Product Candidates;
● the scope, progress, results and costs of development of
our manufacturing technologies;
● the
number of and development requirements for other Products and Product Candidates that we pursue;
●
the costs, timing and outcome
of regulatory review of our Product Candidates;
● our ability to enter into contract manufacturing arrangements
for supply of materials and manufacture of our Products and Product Candidates and the terms of such arrangements;
● the
impact of any acquired, or in-licensed, externally developed product(s) and/or technologies;
●
our ability to establish
and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements, including sales arrangements, and the financial terms of
such arrangements;
●
the sales, costs and timing
of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, for any of our Products
and for Product Candidates for which we may receive marketing approval;
●
the costs and timing of
preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights
and defending any intellectual property- related claims;
●
expansion costs of our
operational, financial and management systems and increases to our personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development,
manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a dual listed company; and
●
the costs to obtain, maintain,
expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.
A change in the outcome of any of these, or other
variables with respect to the development of any of our Products and Product Candidates, could significantly change the costs and timing
associated with their development. We will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.
In addition to the variables described above,
if and when any of our Product Candidates successfully complete development, we will incur substantial additional costs associated with
regulatory filings, marketing approval, post-marketing requirements, maintaining our intellectual property rights, and regulatory protection,
in addition to other commercial costs. We cannot reasonably estimate these costs at this time.
34
InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Three and six months ended December 31, 2022
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate
substantial revenues from either our Products or Product Candidates, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity
or debt financings and collaboration arrangements. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. To the extent
that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity securities, the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted,
and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common
shareholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would
restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts, and additional capital may not be
available on reasonable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements or other strategic transactions
in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, Products or Product Candidates,
or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings
when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights
to develop and market Products or Product Candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented we did not have,
and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates
We periodically review our financial reporting
and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current
economic and business environment. As part of this process, we have reviewed our selection, application and communication of critical
accounting policies and financial disclosures. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies
with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to critical accounting
policies in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
This discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included as part of this report,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the revenue and expenses incurred
during the reported periods. We base estimates on our historical experience, known trends and various other factors that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Detailed information about our critical accounting
policies and estimates is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. There have
been no significant changes to these policies during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Going Concern
Through December 31, 2022, we have funded our
operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of common shares. We have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations
since our inception, including net losses of $5.6 million and $7.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In addition, we have an accumulated deficit of $99.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Our accumulated deficit increased between 2014,
when we began focusing on the development of cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals following the acquisition of Biogen Science Inc., and
June 30, 2022 by approximately $70.2 million and we expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future.
As of the issuance date of the condensed consolidated
interim financial statements, we expect our cash and cash equivalents of $11.5 million as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund
our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the last quarter of calendar 2023, depending on the level and timing of realizing revenues from the BayMedica commercial operations as well as the level
and timing of the Company operating expense. Our future viability is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our
operations. In addition, there are a number of uncertainties in estimating our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
including the impact of potential acquisitions.
As a result, we have concluded that there is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements are issued.
We expect to seek additional funding through
equity financings, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies, government contracts or other
strategic transactions. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely
affect the holdings or the rights of our existing shareholders.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. As of December 31, 2022, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Interim Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934). Our
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Based upon the evaluation, they have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to a material weakness that existed in our internal controls over financial reporting,
primarily the result of inadequate resources required to respond to financial reporting matters other than in the normal course of business,
as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
It should be noted that any system of controls
is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable (and not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting, except for the items discussed in remediation below.
Remediation
We began implementing a remediation plan to address
the previously reported material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, described in Part II, Item 9A, “Controls
and Procedures” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Remediation measures include adding additional
resources to our finance function, retaining the services of outside consultants and establishing additional review procedures over the
accounting for complex and non-routine transactions. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, until the applicable controls
operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2023. Notwithstanding the material
weakness, we believe the financial statements in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results
of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
36
PART II
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
We are not involved in any material active legal
