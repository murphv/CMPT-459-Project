(1) Translation adjustments arising in translating the financial statements of a foreign entity have no effect on the income taxes of that foreign entity. They may, however, affect: (a) the amount, measured in the parent entity's reporting currency, of withholding taxes assessed on dividends paid to the parent entity and (b) the amount of taxes assessed on the parent entity by the government of its country.
The Company has determined that the reinvestment of earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are indefinite because of the long-term nature of the Company's foreign investment plans. Therefore, deferred taxes are not provided for on translation adjustments related to non-remitted earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) November 30, 2022
N OTE 1 – COMPANY OVERVIEW AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
PriceSmart, Inc.’s (“PriceSmart,” the “Company,” or "we") business consists primarily of international membership shopping warehouse clubs similar to, but typically smaller in size than, warehouse clubs in the United States. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had
50
warehouse clubs in operation in
12
countries and
one
U.S. territory ( nine
in Colombia;
eight
in Costa Rica;
seven
in Panama;
five
in the Dominican Republic and Guatemala,
four
in Trinidad;
three
in Honduras;
two
each in El Salvador, Jamaica, and Nicaragua; and
one
each in Aruba, Barbados, and the United States Virgin Islands), of which the Company owns
100 % of the corresponding legal entities (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). The Company plans to open a warehouse club in San Miguel, El Salvador in the spring of 2023 and a warehouse club in Medellín, Colombia in the summer of 2023. Once these
two
new clubs are open, the Company will operate
52
warehouse clubs. Our operating segments are the United States, Central America, the Caribbean, and Colombia.
PriceSmart continues to invest in technology and talent to support the following three major drivers of growth: 1. Expand Real Estate Footprint with New Clubs and Distribution Facilities; 2. Increase Membership Value; and 3. Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Online, Digital and Technological Capabilities.
Basis of Presentation
–
The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”).
The interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PriceSmart, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
Intercompany transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
–
The interim consolidated financial statements of the Company included herein include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest, and the Company’s joint ventures for which the Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. The interim consolidated financial statements also include the Company's investment in, and the Company's share of the income (loss) of, joint ventures recorded under the equity method. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year.
The Company determines whether any of the joint ventures in which it has made investments is a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) at the start of each new venture and if a reconsideration event has occurred. At this time, the Company also considers whether it must consolidate a VIE and/or disclose information about its involvement in a VIE.
A reporting entity must consolidate a VIE if that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. If the Company determines that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, then the Company records its investment in, and the Company's share of the income (loss) of, joint ventures recorded under the equity method. Due to the nature of the joint ventures that the Company participates in and the continued commitments for additional financing, the Company determined these joint ventures are VIEs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)
In the case of the Company's ownership interest in real estate development joint ventures, both parties to each joint venture share all rights, obligations and the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance. As a result, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and, therefore, has accounted for these entities under the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company's investments in unconsolidated affiliates are initially recorded as an investment in the stock of an investee at cost and are adjusted for the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the investor's share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of the initial investment. The Company's ownership interest in real estate development joint ventures the Company has recorded under the equity method as of November 30, 2022 are listed below:

Use of Estimates
– The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
–
The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions in the process of settlement.
Restricted Cash

with a few of its lenders as compensating balances for several U.S. dollar denominated loans payable over several years. The certificates of deposit will be reduced annually commensurate with the loan balances.
Short-Term Investments
– The Company considers as short-term investments, certificates of deposit and similar time-based deposits with financial institutions with maturities over three months and up to one year.
Long-Term Investments
– The Company considers as long-term investments, certificates of deposit and similar time-based deposits with financial institutions with maturities over one year.
Goodwill
– Goodwill totaled $ 43.2
million as of November 30, 2022 and $ 43.3
million as of August 31, 2022. The Company reviews reported goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.
Receivables
–
Receivables consist primarily of credit card receivables and receivables from vendors and are stated net of allowances for credit losses. The determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on the Company’s assessment of collectability along with the consideration of current and expected market conditions that could impact collectability.

Tax Receivables
–
The Company pays Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or similar taxes, income taxes, and other taxes within the normal course of business in most of the countries in which it operates related to the procurement of merchandise and/or services the Company acquires and/or on sales and taxable income. VAT is a form of indirect tax applied to the value added at each stage of production (primary, manufacturing, wholesale and retail). This tax is similar to, but operates somewhat differently than, sales tax paid in the United States. The Company generally collects VAT from its Members upon sale of goods and services and pays VAT to its vendors upon purchase of goods and services. Periodically, the Company submits VAT reports to governmental agencies and reconciles the VAT paid and VAT received. The net overpaid VAT may be refunded or applied to subsequent returns, and the net underpaid VAT must be remitted to the government. With respect to income taxes paid, if the estimated income taxes paid or withheld exceed the actual income tax due, this creates an income tax receivable. In most countries where the Company operates, the governments have implemented additional collection procedures, such as requiring credit card processors to remit a portion of sales processed via credit and debit cards directly to the government as advance payments of VAT and/or income tax. This collection mechanism generally leaves the Company with net VAT and/or income tax receivables, forcing the Company to process significant refund claims on a recurring basis.
These refund or offset processes can take anywhere from several months to several years to complete.
In
two
countries where the Company operates, minimum income tax rules require the Company to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales rather than income.
As a result, the Company is making income tax payments substantially in excess of those it would expect to pay based on taxable income. The Company had income tax receivables of $ 11.2
million and $ 11.0
million and deferred tax assets of $ 3.7
million and $ 3.5
million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, in these countries.
The Company has not placed any type of allowance on the recoverability of these tax receivables or deferred tax assets, because the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will ultimately succeed in its refund requests.
The Company’s policy for classification and presentation of VAT receivables, income tax receivables and other tax receivables is as follows:
 Short-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Prepaid expenses and other current assets: This classification is used for any countries where the Company’s subsidiary has generally demonstrated the ability to recover the VAT or income tax receivable within one year. The Company also classifies as short-term any approved refunds or credit notes to the extent that the Company expects to receive the refund or use the credit notes within one year.
 Long-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other non-current assets:
This classification is used for amounts not approved for refund or credit in countries where the Company’s subsidiary has not demonstrated the ability to obtain refunds within one year and/or for amounts which are subject to outstanding disputes. An allowance is provided against VAT and income tax receivable balances in dispute when the Company does not expect to eventually prevail in its recovery. The Company does not currently have any allowances provided against VAT and income tax receivables.

Lease Accounting –
The Company’s leases are operating leases for warehouse clubs and non-warehouse club facilities such as corporate headquarters, regional offices, and regional distribution centers. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease and classifies it as either a finance or operating lease at lease inception. Operating leases are included in
Operating lease right-of-use assets, net ;
Operating lease liabilities, current portion ; and
Long-term operating lease liabilities
on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have finance leases.
Operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company’s leases generally do not have a readily determinable implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses a collateralized incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on a yield curve derived from publicly traded bond offerings for companies with credit characteristics that approximate the Company's market risk profile.
In addition, we adjust the incremental borrowing rate for jurisdictional risk derived from quoted interest rates from financial institutions to reflect the cost of borrowing in the Company’s local markets. The Company’s lease terms may include options to purchase, extend or terminate the lease, which are recognized when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. T he Company does not combine lease and non-lease components.
The Company measures Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities, adjusted for any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made to the lessor before or at the commencement date (net of lease incentives). The lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the ROU asset and the related lease liability and are recognized as lease expense is incurred. The Company’s variable lease payments generally relate to amounts
the Company pays for additional contingent rent based on a contractually stipulated percentage of sales.
Merchandise Inventories –
Merchandise inventories, which include merchandise for resale, are valued at the lower of cost (average cost) or net realizable value. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses and obsolescence based on a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted every reporting period to reflect the trend of actual physical inventory and cycle count results. In addition, the Company may be required to take markdowns below the carrying cost of certain inventory to expedite the sale of such merchandise.
Stock Based Compensation
–
The Company utilizes
three
types of equity awards: restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”).
Compensation related to RSAs, RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair market value at the time of grant.
The Company recognizes the compensation cost related to RSAs and RSUs over the requisite service period as determined by the grant, amortized ratably or on a straight-line basis over the life of the grant.
The Company also recognizes compensation cost for PSUs over the performance period of each tranche, adjusting this cost based on the Company’s estimate of the probability that performance metrics will be achieved. When an award is forfeited, any previously recorded expense is then reversed.
The Company accounts for actual forfeitures as they occur.
The Company records the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense for stock-based compensation and the tax deficiency resulting from stock-based compensation in excess of the related tax deduction as income tax expense or benefit. In addition, the Company reflects the tax savings (deficiency) resulting from the taxation of stock-based compensation as an operating cash flow in its consolidated statement of cash flows.
‎

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)
RSAs are outstanding shares of common stock and have the same cash dividend and voting rights as other shares of common stock. Shares of common stock subject to RSUs are not issued nor outstanding until vested, and RSUs do not have the same dividend and voting rights as common stock.
However, all outstanding RSUs have accompanying dividend equivalents, requiring payment to the employees and directors with unvested RSUs of amounts equal to the dividend they would have received had the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs been actually issued and outstanding.
Payments of dividend equivalents to employees are recorded as compensation expense.
PSUs, similar to RSUs, are awarded with dividend equivalents, provided that such amounts become payable only if the performance metric is achieved. At the time the Compensation Committee confirms the performance metric has been achieved, the accrued dividend equivalents are paid on the PSUs.
Treasury Stock   – Shares of common stock repurchased by the Company are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in the reduction of stockholders’ equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  The Company may reissue these treasury shares as part of its stock-based compensation programs.  When treasury shares are reissued, the Company uses the first in/first out (“FIFO”) cost method for determining cost of the reissued shares.  If the issuance price is higher than the cost, the excess of the issuance price over the cost is credited to additional paid-in capital (“APIC”).  If the issuance price is lower than the cost, the difference is first charged against any credit balance in APIC from treasury stock and the balance is charged to retained earnings. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company reissued approximately
7,000
treasury shares.                  Fair Value Measurements –  The Company measures the fair value for all financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.
The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction.
A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.
The Company has established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring and revaluing fair value.
These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The Company was not required to revalue any assets or liabilities utilizing Level 1 or Level 3 inputs at the balance sheet dates.
The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities revalued at the balance sheet dates, on a recurring basis, consisted of cash flow hedges (interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps) and forward foreign exchange contracts.
In addition, the Company utilizes Level 2 inputs in determining the fair value of long-term debt.
Non-financial assets and liabilities are revalued and recognized at fair value subsequent to initial recognition when there is evidence of impairment.
For the periods reported,
no
impairment of such non-financial assets was recorded.
The Company’s current and long-term financial assets and liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. The Company’s long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for any applicable unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs.
There have been no significant changes in fair market value of the Company’s current and long-term financial assets, and there have been no material changes to the valuation techniques utilized in the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities disclosed in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities –  The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates.
In using derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the Company’s exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks, the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item and are intended to provide a high degree of risk reduction and correlation.
Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria (effective hedge) are recorded using hedge accounting.
If a derivative financial instrument is an effective hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item completes its contractual term. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.
The Company did not change valuation techniques utilized in the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities presented on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets from previous practice during the reporting period. The Company seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the Company has an established banking relationship.
There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk.
Cash Flow Instruments.
The Company is a party to receive floating interest rate, pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain U.S. dollar denominated debt within its international subsidiaries.
The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of interest expense risk.
These instruments are considered effective hedges and are recorded using hedge accounting.
The Company is also a party to receive variable interest rate, pay fixed interest rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and currency exposure associated with the expected payments of principal and interest of U.S. denominated debt within its international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar.
The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk and interest-rate risk related to payments on the U.S. denominated debt.
These instruments are also considered to be effective hedges and are recorded using hedge accounting.
Under cash flow hedging, the entire gain or loss of the derivative, calculated as the net present value of the future cash flows, is reported on the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are released to earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction impacts consolidated earnings. Refer to “Note 8 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for information on the fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022 .
Fair Value Instruments.
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business.
This includes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on U.S. dollar denominated liabilities within the Company’s international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar.
The Company manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of non-deliverable forward foreign-exchange contracts that are intended to offset changes in cash flows attributable to currency exchange movements.
The contracts are intended primarily to economically address exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar.
Currently, these contracts are treated for accounting purposes as fair value instruments and do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting, and as such the Company does not apply derivative hedge accounting to record these transactions.
As a result, these contracts are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change. The Company seeks to mitigate foreign currency exchange-rate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features and are limited to less than one year in duration.
Revenue Recognition
– The accounting policies and other disclosures such as the disclosure of disaggregated revenues are described in “Note 3 – Revenue Recognition.”
Gain Contingencies and Recoveries
– A gain contingency is an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to a possible gain that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
During the ordinary course of our business, gain contingencies arise when we have the opportunity to recover costs or damages we incur from insurance carriers or other third parties.  Anticipated proceeds in excess of the amount of loss recognized are considered contingent gains. Anticipated proceeds in excess of a loss recognized in the financial statements are not recognized until all contingencies related to the collectability, timing and amount are
realizable.

Cost of Goods Sold
– The Company includes the cost of merchandise and food service and bakery raw materials in cost of goods sold, net merchandise sales. The Company also includes in cost of goods sold: net merchandise sales the external and internal distribution and handling costs for supplying merchandise, raw materials and supplies to the warehouse clubs, and, when applicable, costs of shipping to Members. External costs include inbound freight, duties, drayage, fees, insurance, and non-recoverable value-added tax related to inventory shrink, spoilage and damage. Internal costs include payroll and related costs, utilities, consumable supplies, repair and maintenance, rent expense and building and equipment depreciation at the Company's distribution facilities and payroll and other direct costs for in-club demonstrations.
For export sales, the Company includes the cost of merchandise and external and internal distribution and handling costs for supplying merchandise in cost of goods sold, exports.
For the marketplace and casillero operations, which were disposed of in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company included the costs of external and internal shipping, handling and other direct costs incurred to provide delivery, insurance and customs processing services in cost of goods sold, non-merchandise.
Vendor consideration consists primarily of volume rebates, time-limited product promotions, cooperative marketing efforts, digital advertising, slotting fees, demonstration reimbursements and prompt payment discounts. Volume rebates and time-limited promotions are recognized on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration as the Company progresses toward earning the rebate, provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable.
Cooperative marketing efforts and digital advertising are related to consideration received by the Company from vendors for non-distinct online advertising services on the Company’s website and social media platforms.
Slotting fees are related to consideration received by the Company from vendors for preferential "end cap" placement of the vendor's products within the warehouse club. Demonstration reimbursements are related to consideration received by the Company from vendors for the in-club promotion of the vendors' products. The Company records the reduction in cost of goods sold on a transactional basis for these programs. On a quarterly basis, the Company calculates the amount of rebates recorded in cost of goods sold that relates to inventory on hand and this amount is reclassified as a reduction to inventory, if significant. Prompt payment discounts are taken in substantially all cases and therefore are applied directly to reduce the acquisition cost of the related inventory, with the resulting effect recorded to cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold.   Selling, General and Administrative
– Selling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of expenses associated with operating warehouse clubs and freight forwarding
operations . These costs include payroll and related costs, utilities, consumable supplies, repair and maintenance, rent expense, building and equipment depreciation, bank, credit card processing fees, and amortization of intangibles. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are the payroll and related costs for the Company’s U.S. and regional management and purchasing centers.
Pre-Opening Costs
– The Company expenses pre-opening costs (the costs of start-up activities, including organization costs and rent) for new warehouse clubs as incurred.
Loss Contingencies and Litigation –  The Company records and reserves for loss contingencies if (a) information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
If one or both criteria for accrual are not met, but there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss will occur, the Company does not record and reserve for a loss contingency but describes the contingency within a note and provides detail, when possible, of the estimated potential loss or range of loss. If an estimate cannot be made, a statement to that effect is made.
Foreign Currency Translation
– The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars when the functional currency in the Company’s international subsidiaries is the local currency and not U.S. dollars.
Assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period.
The corresponding translation gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
These adjustments will affect net income upon the sale or liquidation of the underlying investment.

NOTE 3 – REVENUE RECOGNITION
Performance Obligations
The Company identifies each distinct performance obligation to transfer goods (or bundle of goods) or services. The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the goods or services to the customer. ﻿ Net Merchandise Sales .  The Company recognizes net merchandise sales revenue, net of sales taxes, on transactions where the Company has determined that it is the principal in the sale of merchandise. These transactions may include shipping commitments and/or shipping revenue if the transaction involves delivery to the customer.  ﻿ Non-merchandise Sales . Until the disposal of Aeropost in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recognized non merchandise revenue, net of sales taxes, on transactions where the Company had determined that it was the agent in the transaction. These transactions primarily consisted of contracts the Company entered into with its customers to provide delivery, insurance and customs processing services for products its customers purchased online in the United States either directly from other vendors utilizing the vendor’s website or through the Company’s marketplace site. Revenue was recognized when the Company’s performance obligations were completed (that is when delivery of the items have been made to the destination point) and was recorded in “non-merchandise revenue” on the consolidated statements of income. Prepayment for orders for which the Company had not fulfilled its performance obligation were recorded as deferred income. Additionally, the Company recorded revenue at the net amounts retained, i.e., the amount paid by the customer less amounts remitted to the respective merchandise vendors, as the Company was acting as an agent and was not the principal in the sale of those goods being purchased from the vendors by the Company’s customers. ﻿ Membership Fee Revenue.  Membership income represents annual membership fees paid by the Company’s warehouse club Members, which are recognized ratably over the 12-month term of the membership. Our membership policy allows Members to cancel their membership in the first 60 days and receive a full refund. After the 60-day period, membership refunds are prorated over the remaining term of the membership. The Company has significant experience with membership refund patterns and expects membership refunds will not be material. Therefore, no refund reserve was required for the periods presented. Membership fee revenue is included in membership income in the Company's consolidated statements of income. The deferred membership fee is included in deferred income in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. ﻿ Platinum Points Reward Programs.  The Company currently offers Platinum Memberships in all of its
thirteen
countries.  The annual fee for a Platinum Membership is approximately  $ 75 . The Platinum Membership provides Members with a  2 % rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of  $ 500 . The rebate is issued annually to Platinum Members on March 1 and expires August 31.  Platinum Members can apply this rebate to future purchases at the warehouse club during the redemption period.  The Company records this
2 % rebate as a reduction of revenue at the time of the sales transaction.  Accordingly, the Company has reduced warehouse sales and has accrued a liability within other accrued expenses and other current liabilities, platinum rewards. The Company has determined that breakage revenue is  5 %  of the awards issued; therefore, it records  95 % of the Platinum Membership liability at the time of sale. Annually, the Company reviews for expired unused rebates outstanding, and the expired unused rebates are recognized as “Other revenue and income” on the consolidated statements of income.
Co-branded Credit Card Points Reward Programs.   Most of the Company’s subsidiaries have points reward programs related to co-branded credit cards. These points reward programs provide incremental points that can be used at a future time to acquire merchandise within the Company’s warehouse clubs.  This results in two performance obligations, the first performance obligation being the initial sale of the merchandise or services purchased with the co-branded credit card and the second performance obligation being the future use of the points rewards to purchase merchandise or services.  As a result, upon the initial sale, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation with the amount allocated to the future use points rewards recorded as a contract liability within other accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The portion of the selling price allocated to the reward points is recognized as Net merchandise sales when the points are used or when the points expire. The Company reviews on an annual basis expired points rewards outstanding, and the expired rewards are recognized as Net merchandise sales on the consolidated statements of income within markets where the co-branded credit card agreement allows for such treatment.    ﻿ ‎

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)
Gift Cards . Members’ purchases of gift cards to be utilized at the Company's warehouse clubs are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. The outstanding gift cards are reflected as other accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These gift cards generally have a one-year stated expiration date from the date of issuance and are generally redeemed prior to expiration.  However, the absence of a large volume of transactions for gift cards impairs the Company's ability to make a reasonable estimate of the redemption levels for gift cards; therefore, the Company assumes a  100 % redemption rate prior to expiration of the gift card. The Company periodically reviews unredeemed outstanding gift cards, and the gift cards that have expired are recognized as “Other revenue and income” on the consolidated statements of income. ﻿ Co-branded Credit Card Revenue Sharing Agreements . As part of the co-branded credit card agreements that the Company has entered into with financial institutions within its markets, the Company often enters into revenue sharing agreements. As part of these agreements, in some countries, the Company receives a portion of the interest income generated from the average outstanding balances on the co-branded credit cards from these financial institutions (“interest generating portfolio” or “IGP”).   The Company recognizes its portion of interest received as revenue during the period it is earned. The Company has determined that this revenue should be recognized as “Other revenue and income” on the consolidated statements of income.
Contract Performance Liabilities
Contract performance liabilities as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of deferred membership income, other deferred income, deferred gift card revenue, Platinum points programs, and liabilities related to co-branded credit card points rewards programs which are included in deferred income and other accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 4 – EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company presents basic net income per share using the two-class method.
The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that otherwise would have been available to common stockholders and that determines basic net income per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings that would have been available to common stockholders.
A participating security is defined as a security that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock.
The Company’s capital structure includes securities that participate with common stock on a one-for-one basis for distribution of dividends.
These are the restricted stock awards and restricted stock units issued pursuant to the 2013 Equity Incentive Award Plan.
The Company does not include performance stock units as participating securities until the performance criteria are satisfied. The Company determines the diluted net income per share by using the more dilutive of the two class-method or the treasury stock method and by including the basic weighted average of outstanding performance stock units for which performance criteria have not been met in the calculation of diluted net income per share under the two-class method and including all potential common shares assumed issued in the calculation of diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method.
The following table sets forth the computation of net income per share for the three-months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The Company anticipates the ongoing payment of semi-annual dividends in subsequent periods, although the actual declaration of future dividends, if any, the amount of such dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates is subject to final determination by the Board of Directors at its discretion after its review of the Company’s financial performance and anticipated capital requirements, taking into account the uncertain macroeconomic conditions on our results of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 6 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business related to the Company’s operations and property ownership. The Company evaluates such matters on a case by case basis, and vigorously contests any such legal proceedings or claims which the Company believes are without merit. The Company believes that the final disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. It is possible, however, that the Company's results of operations for a particular quarter or fiscal year could be impacted by changes in circumstances relating to such matters.
The Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If it is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss will occur, the Company will provide disclosure regarding the contingency.
On August 5, 2022, PriceSmart received notice from Click USA Inc. and Aeropost, Inc. alleging that PriceSmart had breached certain provisions of a Stock Purchase Agreement between PriceSmart and Click USA, Inc. dated October 1, 2021, concerning the sale of Aeropost, Inc. to Click USA Inc. In this notice, Click USA Inc. and Aeropost, Inc. allege that PriceSmart made inaccurate or incomplete representations and warranties relating to Aeropost, Inc.’s cyber security and the condition of its IT systems in connection with the sale. Click USA Inc. and Aeropost, Inc. further asserted that, in or around April 2022, Aeropost, Inc. suffered cyberattacks, and they seek to hold PriceSmart liable for some amount of damages due to alleged losses directly relating to the cyber-attacks as well as due to possible third-party claims as a result of the cyber-attacks. The notice suggested that aggregate losses attributable to these losses and future claims could exceed $ 3,000,000 . On October 17, 2022, PriceSmart received a letter from Click USA Inc. supplementing its August 5, 2022 notice with additional information concerning Click USA Inc.’s direct losses and the existence or likelihood of third-party claims and potential related losses. Click USA Inc.’s letter estimates its total losses for direct and third-party claims at $ 2.9
million. Per the express terms of the agreement, the maximum amount of all losses for which PriceSmart may be liable for claims arising out of allegations concerning the above-referenced representations and warranties is $ 4,000,000 . In its October 17, 2022 letter, Click USA Inc. notified PriceSmart of a separate and unrelated claim for breach of representations and warranties in the Stock Purchase Agreement relating to the alleged misclassification of an employee in Costa Rica. Click USA Inc. alleges that the amount of possible loss relating to this claim is approximately $ 300,000 . PriceSmart intends to vigorously defend itself against all of Click USA Inc.’s claims and, as such, we have concluded that a loss related to this matter is not probable and any potential loss is not reasonably estimable; therefore, we have not accrued a liability for this matter.
Income Taxes –
For interim reporting, we estimate an annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate income tax expense. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss) .

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company is required to file federal and state tax returns in the United States and various other tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. The preparation of these tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company. The Company, in consultation with its tax advisors, bases its tax returns on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The tax returns, however, are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the Company files its returns. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with the interpretations the Company used to calculate its tax liability and therefore require the Company to pay additional taxes.
The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of probable additional income tax liability.
In certain cases, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than 50% likelihood of being sustained. There were no material changes in the Company’s uncertain income tax positions during the three months ended November 30, 2022 .
In evaluating the exposure associated with various non-income tax filing positions, the Company accrues for probable and estimable exposures for non-income tax related tax contingencies. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the Company has recorded within other accrued expenses a
total of $ 1.1  million
for various non-income tax related tax contingencies.
While the Company believes the recorded liabilities are adequate, there are inherent limitations in projecting the outcome of litigation, in estimating probable additional income tax liability taking into account uncertain tax positions and in evaluating the probable additional tax associated with various non-income tax filing positions. As such, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the sensitivity to change of estimates affecting its recorded liabilities. As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability and revises its estimates as appropriate.
In two countries where the Company operates, minimum income tax rules require the Company to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales rather than income.
As a result, the Company is making income tax payments substantially in excess of those it would expect to pay based on taxable income. The Company had income tax receivables of $ 11.2
million and $ 11.0
million and deferred tax assets of $ 3.7
million and $ 3.5
million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, in these countries. While the rules related to refunds of income tax receivables in these countries are either unclear or complex, the Company has not placed any type of allowance on the recoverability of these tax receivables or deferred tax assets, because the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will ultimately succeed in its refund requests .
Other Commitments
The Company is also committed to non-cancelable construction service obligations for various warehouse club developments and expansions. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 15.8
million and $ 16.5  million, respectively, in contractual obligations for construction services not yet rendered.
From time to time, the Company has entered into general land purchase and land purchase option agreements. The Company’s land purchase agreements are typically subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, the ability to obtain necessary governmental permits or approvals. A deposit under an agreement is typically returned to the Company if all permits or approvals are not obtained. Generally, the Company has the right to cancel any of its agreements to purchase land without cause by forfeiture of some or all of the deposits it has made pursuant to the agreement. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had entered into three land purchase agreements for new warehouse clubs that, if completed, would result in the use of approximately $ 9.7
million in cash.

NOTE 8 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk relating to its ongoing business operations.
To manage interest rate exposure, the Company enters into hedge transactions (interest rate swaps) using derivative financial instruments.
The objective of entering into interest rate swaps is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the LIBOR interest payments associated with variable-rate loans over the life of the loans.
As changes in interest rates impact the future cash flow of interest payments, the hedges provide a synthetic offset to interest rate movements.
In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate cash flow exposure related to non-functional currency long-term debt of two of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
To manage this foreign currency and interest rate cash flow exposure, the Company’s subsidiaries entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps that convert their U.S. dollar denominated floating interest payments to functional currency fixed interest payments during the life of the hedging instrument.  As changes in foreign exchange and interest rates impact the future cash flow of interest payments, the hedges are intended to offset changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate and foreign exchange movements.
These derivative instruments (cash flow hedging instruments) are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, with the entire gain or loss on the derivative reported as a component of other comprehensive loss.
Amounts are deferred in other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings.
The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business, including foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations on U.S. dollar denominated liabilities within its international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar.
The Company manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of non-deliverable forward foreign-exchange contracts (NDFs) that are intended to offset changes in cash flow attributable to currency exchange movements.
These contracts are intended primarily to economically address exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar.
Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting.
The Company seeks to mitigate foreign-currency exchange-rate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions.
These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features.

Forward derivative gains and (losses) on non-deliverable forward foreign-exchange contracts are included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income in the period of change, but the amounts were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021.
NOTE 9 – SEGMENTS
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the international operation of membership shopping in
50
warehouse clubs located in
12
countries and
one
U.S. territory that are located in Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. In addition, the Company operates distribution centers and corporate offices in the United States. The Company has aggregated its warehouse clubs, distribution centers and corporate offices into reportable segments. The Company’s reportable segments are based on management’s organization of these locations into operating segments by general geographic location, used by management and the Company's chief operating decision maker in setting up management lines of responsibility, providing support services, and making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance. Segment amounts are presented after converting to U.S. dollars and consolidating eliminations. Certain revenues, operating costs and inter-company charges included in the United States segment are not allocated to the segments within this presentation, as it is impractical to do so, and they appear as reconciling items to reflect the amount eliminated on consolidation of intersegment transactions. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and net income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. When the Company does so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.

Overview
The mission of our business is to improve the lives of our employees and Members, provide socially responsible support to the communities in which we operate our business and deliver a fair financial return to our investors. PriceSmart is the only membership-based warehouse club business in the markets where we operate in Latin America and the Caribbean. Following in the tradition of PriceClub® and Costco®, our goal is to offer high quality merchandise at the lowest possible prices by leveraging volume purchasing and eliminating inefficiencies from the distribution network.
PriceSmart opened its first location in Panama City, Panama in October of 1996. Today, our company operates 50 warehouse clubs in 12 countries, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands, with revenues in excess of $4.0 billion in fiscal year 2022.
Membership is a key characteristic of warehouse clubs. As of November 30, 2022, PriceSmart had in excess of 1.7 million membership accounts, with the average Member paying approximately $35 per year in membership fees. These membership fees are applied to lowering the price of the products we sell. We believe membership also provides a sense of identity and loyalty that, in turn, reduces the need for PriceSmart to spend money on advertising.
As is typical of all warehouse club businesses, PriceSmart stocks a limited number of stock keeping units (SKU’s). Our SKU count is less than 3,000 items, compared to a grocery store that might stock 30,000 SKU’s or a hypermarket that might stock over 100,000 SKU’s. We believe limiting the number of SKU’s contributes to efficiencies at all levels of our business, thereby supporting lower prices for our Members.
PriceSmart offers an extensive selection of its own private label products under the brand “Member’s Selection®”. The Member’s Selection® brand provides our Members with high quality private label merchandise at prices significantly less than the comparable national brands. Similar to other warehouse clubs, PriceSmart has food courts at all locations with the traditional selection of hot dogs and pizza, along with other items.
Unique to many of our PriceSmart clubs, are our coffee bars selling coffee and coffee specialties, with coffee sourced from the coffee growing regions in our markets. PriceSmart also offers an extensive line of bakery products, which are produced by our bakeries.
Our warehouse clubs range in sales floor size from approximately 30,000 to 60,000 square feet. Our larger clubs are typically located in and around densely populated major cities that include a large penetration of consumers with significant disposable income.
Our smaller clubs tend to be in areas with less population density, but where there are significant opportunities to serve the population and supply and support businesses. We also operate smaller format clubs in urban areas where it is difficult to secure sufficient real estate at a reasonable cost.
32          Table of Contents
We strategically invest in technology to enhance Member experience and convenience. We believe technology allows us to access valuable data that supports our ability to increase efficiencies and gain important insights about our Members. We now provide digital membership and auto-renewal for the convenience of our Members.
Our logistics and distribution infrastructure is key to maximizing efficiencies. We continually review and upgrade our logistics and distribution systems in an attempt to capture efficiencies as our business grows in sales volume, in geography and through activity generated by e-commerce. We utilize regional distribution centers in the U.S. and Costa Rica as well as several local distribution centers to distribute merchandise efficiently and to create flexibility to mitigate the risk of supply-chain disruption. We also seek to capture efficiencies by using specialized distribution centers for produce and centralized production for categories such as bakery and meat processing.
Purchasing land and constructing warehouse clubs is generally our largest ongoing capital investment. Securing land for warehouse club locations is challenging in several of our markets because suitable sites at economically feasible prices are difficult to find. We believe ownership of our real estate in many of our markets provides several advantages, including lower operating expenses, flexibility to expand or otherwise enhance our buildings, long-term control over the use of the property and potential increase of value in future years. Although we prefer to own real estate, we sometimes lease our real estate when leasing provides the best available opportunity.
We do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various local and international retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry outlets, hard discounters, home improvement centers, electronic retailers, specialty stores, convenience stores, traditional wholesale distribution and online sales.

Our warehouse clubs, one regional distribution center and several smaller local distribution centers are located in Latin America and the Caribbean, and our corporate headquarters, U.S. buying operations and our larger regional distribution center are located primarily in the United States. Our operating segments are the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia.
33          Table of Contents
We are currently constructing a smaller format warehouse club in the Hacienda San Andrés area of San Miguel, El Salvador, approximately 100 miles east of the capital city San Salvador, which is anticipated to open in the spring of 2023. It will be our third club in El Salvador. In addition, we are proceeding with the construction of a smaller format warehouse club in the affluent El Poblado area of Medellín, Colombia. We expect to open this warehouse club, which will be our second club in Medellín and the Company’s tenth warehouse club in Colombia, in the summer of 2023. Once these two new clubs are open, we will operate 52 warehouse clubs. We also export products to a retailer in the Philippines and are exploring expansion of that business in other markets. Factors Affecting Our Business
We continue to encounter operational challenges directly or indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased supply chain pressures, inflation, and foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to affect consumer purchasing behavior as it evolves, and we might not be able to meet unanticipated shifts in consumer demand. The pandemic could also give rise to additional operating costs that could have long-term impacts on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022 .
However, the COVID pandemic also has presented us opportunities to improve how we do business, how we serve our Members and how we treat our employees. In response to the pandemic, we:  Increased our focus on expanding local sourcing and near-shoring of goods that we offer,  Expedited our efforts to engage with Members online, including the launch of PriceSmart.com, and  Highlighted the importance of employee well-being and accelerated our decision to ensure health coverage for all employees in our Company. We also are establishing flexible schedules and hybrid work environments for office employees in order to maximize efficiencies and provide opportunity for balance in our employees’ lives .
Overall economic trends, foreign currency exchange volatility, and other factors impacting the business Our sales and profits vary from market to market depending on general economic factors, including GDP growth; consumer preferences; foreign currency exchange rates; political policies and social conditions; local demographic characteristics (such as population growth); the number of years we have operated in a particular market; and the level of retail and wholesale competition in that market. The economies of many of our markets are dependent on foreign trade, tourism, and foreign direct investments. Uncertain economic conditions and slowdown in global economic growth and investment may impact the economies in our markets, causing significant declines in GDP and employment and devaluations of local currencies against the U.S. dollar.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, inflation in all of our markets and devaluations of foreign currency, especially in Colombia, were significant headwinds. However, some markets, like Costa Rica, benefited from currency appreciation. Substantial product cost increases due to inflation or commodity price increases could impact our financial results and could lead to reduced sales, fewer units sold, and/or margin pressure. Events directly or indirectly related to COVID-19 have resulted in market and supply-chain disruptions. These factors have increased the complexity of managing our inventory flow and business; however, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we saw a general improvement in transit days and reduction in freight rates of our shipping containers. We are working to hold down and/or mitigate the price increases passed on to our Members while maintaining the right inventory mix to grow sales. One key mitigating factor has been our expanded network of distribution centers, which has facilitated alternative routings of shipments, increased throughput, and provided flexibility to mitigate our supply-chain challenges and risks more effectively. Our Colombian market has experienced a foreign currency devaluation against the U.S. dollar of approximately 20% as of November 30, 2022 compared to November 30, 2021. This devaluation increases the cost of imported merchandise to the Member, negatively impacts sales volume and may result in margin pressure.
Currency fluctuation can be one of the largest variables affecting our overall sales and profit performance, as we have experienced in prior fiscal years, because many of our markets are susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, approximately 78.5% of our net merchandise sales were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Of those sales, 49.2% consisted of sales of products we purchased in U.S. dollars.
34          Table of Contents
A devaluation of local currency reduces the value of sales and membership income that is generated in that country when translated to U.S. dollars for our consolidated results. In addition, when local currency experiences devaluation, we may elect to increase the local currency price of imported merchandise to maintain our target margins, which could impact demand for the merchandise affected by the price increase. We may also modify the mix of imported versus local merchandise and/or the source of imported merchandise to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations. Our Colombia market has experienced a foreign currency devaluation against the U.S. dollar of approximately 20% as of November 30, 2022 compared to November 30, 2021. This can increase the cost of imported merchandise to the Member and negatively impact sales volume. As a result, we are considering actions, such as strategically holding pricing steady on certain key U.S. imports to Colombia, instead of increasing the prices to reflect the rising costs of these items. This would adversely impact our total gross margin percentage for our Colombia segment and our Company overall. Information about the effect of local currency devaluations is discussed further in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net Merchandise Sales and
Comparable
Sales.”
Our wallet-share capture of total retail and wholesale sales can vary from market to market due to competition and the availability of other shopping options for our Members. Demographic characteristics within each of our markets can affect both the overall level of sales and future sales growth opportunities. Certain island markets, such as Aruba, Barbados and the U.S. Virgin Islands, offer us limited upside for sales growth given their overall market size.
We continue to face the risk of political instability which may have significant effects on our business. For example, civil unrest in Colombia in response to tax reform and austerity measures paralyzed significant portions of the country’s infrastructure as roadblocks and riots disrupted normal economic activity during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Nicaragua and Honduras experienced anti-government protests in 2019; Costa Rica also had a general strike against tax reform measures that significantly impeded regular economic activity in 2018.
Our operations are subject to volatile weather conditions and natural disasters. In November 2020, Hurricanes Eta and Iota brought severe rainfall, winds, and flooding to a significant portion of Central America, especially Honduras, which caused significant damage to parts of that country’s infrastructure. Although our warehouse clubs were not significantly affected and we were able to manage our supply chain to keep our warehouse clubs stocked with merchandise, similar natural disasters could adversely impact our overall sales, costs and profit performance in the future.
Periodically, we experience a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity), particularly in Trinidad. This can and has impeded our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products and to otherwise redeploy these funds in our Company. This illiquidity also increases our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. For instance, during fiscal year 2021, we experienced significant limitations on our ability to convert Trinidad dollars to U.S. dollars or other tradeable currencies. Our balance as of November 30, 2022 of Trinidad dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments measured in U.S. dollars was $25.6 million, a decrease of $74.9 million from the peak of $100.5 million as of November 30, 2020.
However, as the Trinidad central bank strictly manages the exchange rate of the Trinidad dollar with the U.S. dollar and affects the level of US Dollar liquidity in the market through its interventions, we are subject to continued challenges in converting our Trinidad dollars to U.S. dollars, as well as being exposed to the risk of a potential devaluation of the currency.
Mission and Business Strategy
PriceSmart exists to improve the lives and businesses of our Members, our employees and our communities through the responsible delivery of the best quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices. Our mission is to serve as a model company, which operates profitably and provides a good return to our investors, by providing Members in emerging and developing markets with exciting, high quality merchandise sourced from around the world and valuable services at compelling prices in safe U.S. style clubs and through PriceSmart.com. We prioritize the well-being and safety of our Members and employees. We provide good jobs, fair wages and benefits and opportunities for advancement. We strive to treat our suppliers right and empower them when we can. We conduct ourselves in a socially responsible manner as we endeavor to improve the quality of the lives of our Members and their businesses, while respecting the environment and the laws of all the countries in which we operate. The annual membership fee enables us to operate our business with lower margins than traditional retail stores. As we continue to invest in technological capabilities, we are increasing our tools to drive sales and operational efficiencies. We believe we are well positioned to blend the excitement and appeal of our brick-and-mortar business with the convenience and additional benefits of online shopping and services, and meanwhile, enhance Member experience and engagement.

Growth
As we look to the future, our Company is focused on three major drivers of growth:
 Invest in Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs, Adding New PriceSmart Locations and Opening More Distribution Centers  Increase Membership Value  Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Online, Digital and Technological Capabilities
I. Invest in Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs, Adding New PriceSmart Locations and Opening
More Distribution Centers .
We believe that one of the quickest and most effective ways to increase sales and profitability is to increase the size and number of parking spaces in our high-volume locations. For instance, we are currently preparing to remodel and expand one of our clubs in San Salvador, El Salvador.
We continue to pursue warehouse club growth opportunities in our markets and to assess opportunities in new markets. For example, we plan to open a warehouse club in El Salvador, located in the city of San Miguel in the spring of 2023 and to add a second warehouse club in the city of Medellin, Colombia, in late summer 2023. Our distribution network currently consists of major distribution centers in Miami and Costa Rica, complemented by varying distribution activities in our other markets. Based on our experience with our Costa Rica distribution center, we believe that investing in similar distribution centers in other major markets will play a strategic role in a variety of ways. Configuring these distribution centers to effectively operate as cross-docking facilities, helps us more efficiently manage the high volumes of locally sourced and imported merchandise for our club business. Distribution centers are also strategically important in providing the infrastructure to support PriceSmart.com online sales to both our business and our family Members. In addition to major distribution centers, PriceSmart has been investing in what we call Produce Distribution Centers, which enable us to purchase product directly from farms both in our markets, as well as for imported produce.
II. Increase Membership Value.
We are seeking to attract more Members and retain our current Members by expanding the benefits of being a Member of PriceSmart through sales, services, and convenience. As benefits grow and the value of being a PriceSmart Member increases, adjustments to the membership fee may be warranted. A larger membership base and higher membership fee contribute to the bottom line of the business. We focus on growth of our membership base, Member renewal rates and spend per Member as part of determining how Members see our value. By adding more benefits that Members can only obtain with us, we expect to see growth in the number of Members, which drives Membership income and Merchandise sales. Recent examples of enhancements we have made to the value of membership include: additional services such as the ability for all of our Members to transact on PriceSmart.com; pickup and delivery service in all of our clubs; and the implementation and expansion of our Well-being initiative, which offers Optical services with free eye exams for the Member and additional members of their families and deeply discounted eyeglass frames; Audiology services with free hearing exams and deeply discounted hearing aids; and Pharmacy, which provides a significant convenience to our Members. Another way we enhance Membership value is through our private label offering, “Member’s Selection®,” a brand which is available only to PriceSmart Members. We believe the Member’s Selection® brand carries goodwill and is recognized in our markets for value. Private label also provides us the opportunity to source quality items locally when appropriate. Select local sourcing has multiple benefits, including support of local communities in which we operate by enhancing business activity and creating direct and indirect jobs, mitigation of foreign currency exchange risk, and reduced supply chain exposure. These initiatives offer additional benefits and services for our Members, whether they choose to shop on-line, in-club, or both.
Our private label sales penetration grew to 25.9% of merchandise sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, from 23.6% in the same period of fiscal year 2022, and we plan to continue to invest in the development of additional private label products under the “Member’s Selection®” brand.
36          Table of Contents
III. Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Online, Digital and Technological Capabilities.
We recognize the growing expectation of consumers in our markets for alternative ways of shopping. As a result, we continue to improve the functionality and content of PriceSmart.com and to expand our product offerings available online. We also build and apply technological tools to continue to learn more about and strengthen our relationships with each of our Members. Using data analytics, we believe we have been able to provide our Members with enhancements to the membership experience. PriceSmart.com and these tools provide the opportunity for us to continually strengthen and expand the scope of our relationship with each Member and offer incremental products and services in the future. Our PriceSmart.com offering provides data that informs us regarding the potential viability of new clubs in new areas and offers us options to serve and expand into new markets without the need for a traditional brick & mortar club location. We also invest in technology to capture operational efficiencies and enhance our decision-making for the increasingly dynamic environment we are in .
Financial highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 included:
 Total revenues increased 8.1% over the comparable prior year period.
 Net merchandise sales increased 8.6% over the comparable prior year period. We ended the quarter with 50 warehouse clubs compared to 49 warehouse clubs at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by 2.3% versus the same three-month period in the prior year.
 Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the 47 warehouse clubs that have been open for greater than 13 ½ calendar months) for the 13 weeks ended December 4, 2022 increased 5.0%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted comparable net merchandise sales negatively by 2.1%.
 Membership income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 increased 7.5% to $15.9 million over the comparable prior year period.  Total gross margins (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) increased 10.3% over the prior-year period, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales were 16.2%, an increase of 20 basis points (0.2%) from the same period in the prior year.
 Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $55.5 million, an increase of 20.7%, or $9.5 million, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
 We recorded a $4.6 million net loss in
other income (expense), net
primarily from currency transactions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to a $1.9 million net gain primarily from the disposal of Aeropost in the same period last year.  Our effective tax rate decreased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to 33.3% from 34.1% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
The decrease in the effective tax rate is related to the favorable impact from f ewer valuation allowances we took on foreign tax credits that are no longer deemed recoverable and
changes in uncertain tax positions.  Net income attributable to PriceSmart for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $32.9 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $30.5 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.

Comparison of Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021
Overall, total net merchandise sales grew by 8.6% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, driven by a 3.0% increase in transactions and a 5.5% increase in average ticket. Transactions represent the total number of visits our Members make to our warehouse clubs plus the number of Click & Go™ curbside pickup and delivery service transactions. Average ticket represents the amount our Members spend on each visit or Click & Go™ order. We had 50 clubs in operation as of November 30, 2022 compared to 49 clubs as of November 30, 2021.
Net merchandise sales in our Central America segment increased 10.1% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. This increase had a 600 basis point (6.0%) positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth. All markets within this segment showed increased net merchandise sales during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.
Net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment increased 12.9% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. This increase had a 360 basis point (3.6%) positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth. All of our markets in this segment had positive net merchandise sales growth. Our Dominican Republic market continued its strong performance in the quarter with 19.6% growth. We added one new club to the segment when compared to the comparable prior-year period. We opened our second warehouse club in Jamaica in April 2022.
Net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment decreased 8.3% during
the first quarter of
fiscal year 2023. This decrease had a 100 basis point (1.0%) negative impact on total net merchandise sales growth. The primary driver of the decreased sales for the quarter was due to the significant devaluation of the Colombian peso during the past several months, which has negatively impacted sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 .
The following table indicates the impact that currency exchange rates had on our net merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the three-month period ended November 30, 2022.
The term “currency exchange rates” refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert net merchandise and comparable net merchandise sales for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activities translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. We believe the disclosure of the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results permits investors to understand better the Company’s underlying performance.

Overall, the effects of currency fluctuations within our markets had an approximately $21.2 million, or 230 basis point (2.3%), negative impact on net merchandise sales for the three-months ended November 30, 2022.
Currency fluctuations had a $2.3 million, or 40 basis point (0.4%), negative impact on net merchandise sales in our Central America segment for the three months ended November 30, 2022. These currency fluctuations contributed approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of negative impact on total net merchandise sales for the quarter ended November 30, 2022. The Honduran Lempira and Guatemalan Quetzal devalued significantly against the US dollar. This devaluation was partially offset by an appreciation in the Costa Rica
Colón .
Currency fluctuations had a $4.7 million, or 180 basis point (1.8%), positive impact on net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment for the three months ended November 30, 2022. These currency fluctuations contributed approximately 50 basis points (0.5%) of positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth for the period. The Dominican Republic market experienced currency appreciation when compared to the same three-month period last year.
Currency fluctuations had a $ 23.6 million, or 2,050 basis point (20.5%), negative impact on net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment for the three months ended November 30, 2022. These currency fluctuations contributed approximately 260 basis points (2.6%) of negative impact on total net merchandise sales for the current
fiscal year period.
Comparable Merchandise Sales
We report comparable net merchandise sales on a “same week” basis with 13 weeks in each quarter beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. The periods are established at the beginning of the fiscal year to provide as close of a match as possible to the calendar month and quarter that is used for financial reporting purposes. This approach equalizes the number of weekend days and weekdays in each period for improved sales comparison, as we experience higher merchandise club sales on the weekends. Each of the warehouse clubs used in the calculations was open for at least 13 ½ calendar months before its results for the current period were compared with its results for the prior period. As a result, sales related to three of our warehouse clubs opened during fiscal year 2022 will not be used in the calculation of comparable sales until they have been open for at least 13 ½ months. Therefore, comparable net merchandise sales includes 47 warehouse clubs for the thirteen-week period ended December 4, 2022.
The following tables indicate the comparable net merchandise sales in the reportable segments in which we operate and the percentage changes in net merchandise sales by segment during the thirteen-week period ended December 4, 2022 and November 28, 2021 compared to the prior year.

Our Dominican Republic market continued its strong performance in the thirteen-week period with 19.2% comparable sales growth. Our U.S. Virgin Islands and Barbados markets also showed strong performance this quarter with 4.3% and 3.4% comparable sales growth, respectively. This strong performance was offset by our Jamaica market, which declined in comparable net merchandise sales by 6.9% for the thirteen-week period due to sales transfers from the existing club included in the comparable net merchandise sales calculation to new clubs not included in the calculation.
Comparable net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment decreased 13.1% for the thirteen-week period ended December 4, 2022. This decrease contributed approximately 160 basis points (1.6%) of negative impact in total comparable merchandise sales for the period. The decrease in Colombia during the current quarter was primarily due to the foreign currency devaluation and sales transfers from existing clubs included in the comparable net merchandise sales calculation to a new club not included in the calculation.
The following tables illustrate the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our comparable merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change for the

Comparison of Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021
The number of Member accounts as of November 30, 2022
was 3.9% higher than the prior year period. Membership income increased 7.5% over the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, compared to the prior-year period.
Membership income increased across our Central America and Caribbean segments and decreased in our Colombia segment for the three months ended November 30, 2022. The consolidated increase in membership income is due to an increasing membership base since the comparable prior year period. The Caribbean had the largest increase in membership base in the first three months of fiscal year 2023 compared to the comparable prior year period
with 5.5% growth, followed by Central America with a 3.9% increase and Colombia with a 1.9% increase.
Since August 31, 2022, our Central America and Caribbean segments have increased their membership base and our Colombia segment has faced a decline in its membership base.
We offer the Platinum Membership program in all locations where PriceSmart operates. The annual fee for a Platinum Membership in most markets is approximately $75. The Platinum Membership program provides Members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500. We record the 2% rebate as a reduction on net merchandise sales at the time of the sales transaction. Platinum Membership accounts were 7.9% of our total membership base as of November 30, 2022, an increase from 6.5% as of November 30, 2021. Platinum Members tend to have higher renewal rates than our Diamond Members.
Our trailing twelve-month renewal rate was 87.9% and 89.0% for the periods ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, respectively.

Comparison of Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021
Total gross margin
is derived from our Revenue – Net merchandise sales less our Cost of goods sold – Net merchandise sales and
represents
our sales less cost of sales generated from the business activities of our warehouse clubs. We express our Total gross margin percentage as a percentage of our Net merchandise sales.
On a consolidated basis, total gross margin for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was 16.2%, 20 basis points (0.2%) higher than the
comparable
prior year period. This increase was primarily due to general margin improvement across most of our sales categories, particularly food service and bakery, and from favorable freight costs.
Total revenue margin is derived from Total revenues, which includes our Net merchandise sales, Membership income, Export sales, and Other revenue and income less our Cost of goods sold for net merchandise sales, Export sales, and Non-merchandise revenues. We express our Total revenue margin as percentage of Total revenues.
Total revenue margin increased 20 basis points (0.2%) for the three months ended November 30, 2022, primarily due to improved total gross margins of 20 basis points (0.2%).
Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of warehouse club and other operations, general and administrative expenses, pre-opening expenses, and loss on disposal of assets. In total, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.0 million compared to the prior year but decreased as a percentage of total revenue, declining 40 basis points (0.4%) to 12.3% of total revenue compared to 12.7% of total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 due to severance costs. Please refer to “Item 1. Financial Statements: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10 – Subsequent Events” for further discussion.
Warehouse club and other operations expenses decreased to 9.2% of total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to 9.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, primarily due to 10 basis points of lower operations expenses associated with our casillero and marketplace business due to the sale of Aeropost on October 1, 2021. The 10 basis point savings resulting from the Aeropost sale was supplemented by reduced warehouse club and other operations expenses as a percentage of revenue in our Colombia market, which decreased 10 basis points (0.1%) primarily due to the devaluation of the Colombian peso.
General and administrative expenses decreased to 3.1% of total revenues for the current quarter compared to 3.2% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The 10 basis point (0.1%) decrease is primarily due to a 10 basis point (0.1%) decrease from the reduction in general and administrative expenses due to the sale of Aeropost.
Operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 increased to $55.5 million (5.3% of total revenue) compared to $46.0 million (4.7% of total revenue) for the same period last year. This reflects the increase in total revenue margin of 20 basis points (0.2%), along with a 40 basis point (0.4%) increase due to leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses over the comparable prior-year period.

Net interest expense increased for the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, primarily due to the increase in long-term borrowings in our Trinidad market to facilitate conversion of Trinidad dollars to US dollars and a decrease in capitalized interest from fewer construction projects compared to the prior year.   Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net, consists of currency gains or losses, as well as net benefit costs related to our defined benefit retirement plans and other items considered to be non-operating in nature.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity (primarily U.S. dollars) are revalued to the functional currency using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
These foreign exchange transaction gains/(losses) are recorded as currency gains or losses. Additionally, gains or losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity also generate currency gains or losses.
Comparison of Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 and 2021
For the three-months ended November 30, 2022, the primary driver of other income (expense), net was $3.2 million of foreign currency losses due to revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities (primarily U.S. dollars) in several of our markets. In addition, we had higher transaction costs of $1.1 million associated with converting Trinidad dollars into available tradeable currencies, such as euros or Canadian dollars, before converting them to U.S. dollars.

For the three months ended November 30, 2022, the effective tax rate was 33.3% compared to 34.1% for the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate versus the prior year was primarily attributable to the following factors:
 A comparably favorable benefit from recurring items of 0.5%, primarily resulting from fewer valuation allowances we took with respect to deferred tax assets from foreign tax credits that are no longer deemed recoverable; and  A comparably favorable net tax impact from non-recurring items of 0.4%,
primarily related to changes in uncertain tax positions.

Our other comprehensive loss of approximately $0.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 resulted primarily from the comprehensive loss of approximately $0.9 million from foreign currency translation adjustments related to assets and liabilities and the translation of revenue, costs and expenses on the statements of income of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. During the first three months of fiscal year 2023, the largest translation adjustments were related to the devaluation of the local currencies against the U.S. dollar for our Colombia, Dominican Republic and Jamaica subsidiaries, partially offset by the translation adjustment for the appreciation of the local currency against the U.S. dollar of our Costa Rica subsidiary. These losses were offset by approximately $0.3 million related to unrealized gains on changes in the value of our derivative obligations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Financial Position and Cash Flow
Our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.
We generate cash from operations primarily through net merchandise sales and membership fees. Cash used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse club and distribution center operating costs (including payroll, employee benefits and utilities), as well as payments for income taxes.
Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have generally been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations and to pay dividends on our common stock. We evaluate our funding requirements on a regular basis to cover any shortfall in our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our capital requirements. We may consider funding alternatives to provide additional liquidity if necessary. Refer to
“Item 1. Financial Statements: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7 - Debt” for additional information regarding our available short-term facilities, short-term and long-term borrowings, and any repayments.
Repatriation of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may require us to accrue and pay taxes.
We have no plans at this time to repatriate cash through the payment of cash dividends by our foreign subsidiaries to our domestic operations and, therefore, have not accrued taxes that would be due from repatriation.

As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, there were no certificates of deposit with a maturity of over a year held by our foreign subsidiaries and domestically.
From time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products or otherwise fund our operations. Since fiscal 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to source a sufficient level of tradeable currencies. We are working with our banks in Trinidad and government officials to convert all of our Trinidad dollars into tradeable currencies. We have and continue to take additional actions in this respect. Refer to “Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Factors Affecting Our Business” for our quantitative analysis and discussion.

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $30.5 million and net cash used in operating activities totaled $13.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, respectively. Shifts in working capital generated from changes in our merchandise inventory and accounts payable positions for the three months ended November 30, 2022 contributed $29.0 million to net cash provided by operating activities compared to the same prior year three-month period ended November 30, 2021. The prior year increase in inventory reflected our efforts to increase inventory to accommodate pandemic influenced consumer preferences and to mitigate out-of-stocks due to supply-chain disruptions during that period. Our inventory buildup for the holiday season this fiscal year was lower as we set our inventory position to align more with our historical days-on-hand, and we have rebalanced our inventory mix to reflect current and anticipated consumer demand and preferences.
This net positive change was supplemented by another net positive change of $11.3 million in various current and non-current assets and liabilities, primarily driven by less prepaid VAT and fewer security deposits as the build-up of inventory was significantly less for these periods, comparatively.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $21.5 million and $12.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021. The $9.4 million increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of a net $13.3 million decrease in proceeds from settlements of short-term investments, with a $4.3 million decrease in purchases of short-term investments, compared to the same three-month period a year-ago. The decrease in proceeds from settlements and purchases of short-term investments is primarily due the overall net decrease of short-term investments in Trinidad as our Trinidad dollar balances are comparably lower than the prior year period. ﻿ Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $14.7 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We use cash flows provided by financing primarily to fund our working capital needs, our warehouse club and distribution center acquisitions and expansions, and investments in technology to support our omni-channel initiatives. The $13.5 million increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the net $16.7 million increase in long-term bank proceeds and repayments, partially offset by a $4.3 million net decrease between the proceeds and repayment of short-term borrowings, compared to the same three-month period a year-ago. Total proceeds from long-term debt received during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $19.9 million compared to $4.2 million
in the same period last year.

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt
Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets while minimizing our borrowing costs.
The proceeds of these borrowings were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its financial condition or consolidated financial statements.
Repurchase of Equity Securities and Reissuance of Treasury Shares
At the vesting dates for restricted stock awards to our employees, we repurchase a portion of the shares that have vested at the prior day's closing price per share and apply the proceeds to pay the employees' minimum statutory tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of restricted stock awards. The Company expects to continue this practice going forward. We do not currently have a stock repurchase program.
Shares of common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in the reduction of stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheets. We may reissue these treasury shares in the future.
We have reissued treasury shares as part of our stock-based compensation programs.
During the three-months ended November 30, 2022, we reissued
approximately 7 ,000
treasury shares.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Some of our accounting policies require management to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to business acquisitions, contingencies and litigation, income taxes, value added taxes, and long-lived assets.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances.
Using different estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Income Taxes
For interim reporting, we estimate an annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate income tax expense. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss).
We are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. The preparation of these tax returns requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by us. We, in consultation with our tax advisors, base our tax returns on interpretations that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The tax returns, however, are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we file our tax returns. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the interpretations we used to calculate our tax liability and therefore require us to pay additional taxes.
We accrue an amount for our estimate of probable additional income tax liability. In certain cases, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has 50% or less likelihood of being sustained. This requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. There were no material changes in our uncertain income tax positions for the period ended on November 30, 2022.
Tax Receivables
We pay Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or similar taxes, income taxes, and other taxes within the normal course of our business in most of the countries in which we operate related to the procurement of merchandise and/or services we acquire and/or on sales and taxable income.
VAT is a form of indirect tax applied to the value added at each stage of production (primary, manufacturing, wholesale and retail). This tax is similar to, but operates somewhat differently than, sales tax paid in the United States. We generally collect VAT from our Members upon sale of goods and services and pay VAT to our vendors upon purchase of goods and services. Periodically, we submit VAT reports to governmental agencies and reconcile the VAT paid and VAT received. The net overpaid VAT may be refunded or applied to subsequent returns, and the net underpaid VAT must be remitted to the government.
‎
50          Table of Contents
With respect to income taxes paid, if the estimated income taxes paid or withheld exceed the actual income tax due this creates an income tax receivable. In most countries where we operate, the governments have implemented additional collection procedures, such as requiring credit card processors to remit a portion of sales processed via credit and debit cards directly to the government as advance payments of VAT and/or income tax. This collection mechanism generally leaves us with net VAT and/or income tax receivables, forcing us to process significant refund claims on a recurring basis. These refund or offset processes can take anywhere from several months to several years to complete .
In two countries where the Company operates, there have been changes in the method of computing minimum tax payments, under which the governments have sought to require the Company to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales rather than taxable income. As a result, we have made and may continue to make income tax payments substantially in excess of those we would expect to pay based on taxable income. The Company had income tax receivables of $11.2 million and $11.0 million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and deferred tax assets of $3.7 million and $3.5 million as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, in these countries. While the rules related to refunds of income tax receivables in these countries are either unclear or complex, the Company has not placed any type of allowance on the recoverability of these tax receivables or deferred tax assets, because the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will ultimately succeed in its refund requests. Similarly, we have not placed any recoverability allowances on tax receivables that arise from payments we are required to make originating from tax assessments that we are appealing, as we believe it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in the related appeals. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in recovering all tax receivables or deferred tax assets.
Our policy for classification and presentation of VAT receivables, income tax receivables and other tax receivables is as follows:
 Short-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other current assets: This classification is used for any countries where our subsidiary has generally demonstrated the ability to recover the VAT or income tax receivable within one year.
We also classify as short-term any approved refunds or credit notes to the extent that we expect to receive the refund or use the credit notes within one year.
 Long-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other non-current assets: This classification is used for amounts not approved for refund or credit in countries where our subsidiary has not demonstrated the ability to obtain refunds within one year and/or for amounts which are subject to outstanding disputes.
An allowance is provided against VAT and income tax receivable balances in dispute when we do not expect to eventually prevail in our recovery of such balances. We do not currently have any allowances provided against VAT and income tax receivables.
Long-lived Assets
We evaluate quarterly our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment.
Indicators that an asset may be impaired are:
 the asset's inability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods;  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset;  significant changes in its strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and  the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends.
Management's judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation and can include management's best estimate of future business activity, which in turn drives estimates of future cash flows from these assets. These periodic evaluations could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value. Future business conditions and/or activity could differ materially from the projections made by management causing the need for additional impairment charges. We did not record any impairment charges during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the loss of legal ownership or title to assets; significant changes in the Company's strategic business objectives or utilization of assets; or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. Loss on disposal of assets recorded during the years reported resulted from improvements to operations and normal preventive maintenance.

Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of our goodwill. Because of the nature of the factors used in
these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $43.2 million of certain acquired goodwill, the fair value was greater than the carrying value; however, any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge.   Seasonality
Historically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets.
In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix, and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable.
Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter.
In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates. There have been no material changes in our market risk factors at November 30, 2022 compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022.
From time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products. Since fiscal year 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to source a sufficient level of tradeable currencies. We are working with our banks in Trinidad and Barbados to source tradeable currencies. We expect the illiquid market conditions in both markets to continue. Refer to “Item 2. Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Factors Affecting Our Business” and “Item 2. Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Liquidity: Financial Position and Cash Flow” for our quantitative analysis and discussion.
Information about the financial impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the three-month period ended November 30, 2022 is disclosed in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Other Expense, net”.
Information about the change in the fair value of our hedges and the financial impact thereof for the three-month period ended November 30, 2022 is disclosed in

Information about the movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar for the three-month period ended November 30, 2022 is disclosed in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Other Comprehensive Loss.”

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decision regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Because we do not control or manage those entities, our control procedures with respect to those entities were substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by SEC Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e), we carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and automating manual processes. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the reader should carefully consider the following risk factor, which supplements and should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under Part I. “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.
We may not successfully manage the transition associated with the resignation of our Chief Executive Officer, which could have an adverse impact on us.                 On December 9, 2022, the Company announced that Sherry Bahrambeygui will be resigning as Chief Executive Officer, effective February 3, 2023, the date of the Company’s annual stockholder meeting, in order to pursue new professional and philanthropic interests. Robert Price, a Company founder and Chairman of the Board, will become Interim Chief Executive Officer. John Hildebrandt has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. David Price has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff to the Chairman. When Robert Price becomes Interim Chief Executive Officer, David Price will be Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff to the Interim CEO.                 Ms. Bahrambeygui will continue serving stockholders as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, and is also included in the slate of directors for election at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Prior to her tenure as CEO, she served on the Company’s Board as a director for eight years, including having served as Vice Chair and Chair of the Compensation Committee. Between now and February 3, 2023, Ms. Bahrambeygui will continue her employment and will work towards the orderly transition of her responsibilities. She has agreed to make herself available at the Company’s request for up to 100 hours of transition support during the twelve months following the date of her separation agreement.
Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage. An inadequate transition to a new leadership team may cause disruption within the Company, adversely affecting our financial performance and ability to meet operational goals and strategic plans. Management turnover also inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. In addition, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.
