ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   All for One Media Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Utah on March 2, 2004. The Company is a media and entertainment company focused on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups commonly referred to as “boy bands” and “girl groups.” On October 26, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Exchange Agreement (the “Asset Exchange”) with Crazy for the Boys, LLC (“CFTB”), a privately held company, and certain members owning membership interest in CFTB whereby the Company acquired certain assets from CFTB in exchange for
5,201,500
shares of the Company’s common stock. The assets that were acquired included a movie screenplay, master song recordings, trademarks, and web domain names (the “CFTB Assets”).   On December 7, 2016, the Company organized a subsidiary in the state of Nevada, Crazy for the Boys Movie, LLC (“CFTB Movie”) which was created for the sole purpose of financing, producing and commercially exploiting (via all distribution sources and other means of revenue generation) one feature-length motion picture as a coming of age, musical dramedy, entitled Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of “Crazy For The Boys” (the “Movie”) and all of its allied, ancillary, subsidiaries and merchandising rights. The Company is the Managing Member of CFTB Movie and will have the sole and exclusive right to operate CFTB Movie. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company owns approximately
70 % of CFTB Movie, the Company’s majority owned subsidiary.   In May 2017, the Company entered into an Assignment and Transfer Agreement with Crazy for the Boys GA LLC (“CFTB GA”), a company organized in the state of Georgia, whereby CFTB GA assigned and transferred all ownership, asset rights and other interest in CFTB GA to CFTB Movie. CFTB GA was created for the sole purpose of producing the Movie in the State of Georgia, in the city of Savannah, which offers production incentives up to
30 % of Georgia production expenditures in transferable tax credits. The Georgia tax incentive program is available for qualifying projects, including feature films, television series, commercials, music videos, animation and game development. Consequently, CFTB GA became a wholly owned subsidiary of CFTB Movie and as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CFTB GA. Filming for the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018. The Company started to screen the movie in January 2019 for potential buyers. The Company had received several offers for the distribution of the film and the Company continues to review any offers.   On February 2, 2022, the Company and RA Production, Inc (“RA Production”) (collectively as “Parties”) entered into an Operating Agreement with Boss Music and Entertainment, LLC (“BME”), a Delaware limited liability company (see Note 8). Pursuant to the Operating Agreement,
the Company has 50% interest in BME and was to contribute a total of $1,000,000 towards the BME capital account payable as follows: (i) $200,000 upon signing hereof of the Operating Agreement and (ii) $800,000 payable on the full execution of recording agreements with five artists to form a recording group, (i.e. boy band). As of December 31, 2022, of the total $200,000 only $7,500 of capital contribution had been paid which was recorded as a loss on equity method investment during fiscal 2022 . This project was abandoned and no additional contributions will be made to BME (see Note 8).   NOTE 2 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information, which includes consolidated interim financial statements and present the consolidated interim financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows have been made. Those adjustments consist of normal and recurring adjustments. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022, and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 29, 2022. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.   Cash   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The Company’s accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $ 250,000 . As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company had not reached bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits.
7 Table of Contents   ALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)   Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets   Prepaid expenses and other current assets of $ 6,531
and $ 6,863
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, consist primarily of costs paid for future services which will occur within a year. Prepaid expenses typically include prepayments in cash for consulting which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.   Use of Estimates   In preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include but are not limited to the recoverability of the equity method investment, fair value of common stock issued, the valuation of derivative liabilities, gain (loss) from extinguishment of debt, the valuation of stock-based compensation, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.   Film Production Costs   The Company capitalizes costs which were used in the production of films according to ASC 926, Entertainment - Films. For films produced by the Company, capitalized costs include all direct production and financing costs, capitalized interest and production overhead. Production overhead includes the costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of films. Production overhead does not include general and administrative expenses and marketing, selling and distribution costs. Capitalization of interest costs should generally commence when a film is set for production and end when a film is substantially complete and ready for distribution. Filming the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018. Generally, the interest eligible for capitalization includes stated interest, imputed interest, and interest related to debt instruments as well as amortization of discounts and other debt issue costs.   Pursuant to ASC 926-20-35, the Company will begin to amortize capitalized film cost when a film is released, and it begins to recognize revenue from the film. These costs for an individual film are amortized and participation costs (see below) are accrued to direct operating expenses in the proportion that current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or sale of such film. Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture.   Parties involved in the production of a film may be compensated in part by contingent payments based on the financial results of a film pursuant to contractual formulas (participations) and by contingent amounts due under provisions of collective bargaining agreements (residuals). Such parties are collectively referred to as participants, and such costs are collectively referred to as participation costs. Participations may be given to creative talent, such as actors or writers, or to entities from whom distribution rights are licensed. Participation costs are typically recognized evenly as the ultimate revenues are earned.   Unamortized film costs are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the film may be less than unamortized costs. Consistent with the rules for recognizing impairment of long-lived assets in ASC 926, the standard sets forth examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the entity must assess whether the fair value of the film (whether it has been completed or is still in production) is less than the carrying amount of its unamortized film costs.     1. An adverse change in the expected performance of the film prior to its release,   2. Actual costs substantially in excess of budgeted costs,   3. Substantial delays in completion or release schedules,   4. Changes in release plans, such as a reduction in the initial release pattern,   5. Insufficient funding or resources to complete the film and to market it effectively,   6. Actual performance subsequent to release fails to meet prerelease expectations. (ASC 926-20-35-12)   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   FASB ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to the Company on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the estimates presented in these unaudited consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
8 Table of Contents   ALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)   The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:   Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.   Level 2: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.   Level 3: Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.   The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, due from and to related parties, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.   Assets or liabilities measured at fair value or a recurring basis included embedded conversion options in convertible debt (see Note 5) and were as follows on December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022:       December 31, 2022     September 30, 2022   Description   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Level 1     Level 2     Level 3   Derivative liabilities   $ —     $ —     $ 7,016,885     $ —     $ —     $ 8,149,517     A roll forward of the level 3 valuation financial instruments is as follows:       For the Three Months Ended December 31,       2022     2021   Balance at beginning of period   $ 8,149,517     $ 11,587,761   Initial valuation of derivative liabilities included in debt discount     -       224,000   Initial valuation of derivative liabilities included in derivative expense     -       123,743   Reclassification of derivative liabilities to gain on debt extinguishment     ( 16,256

The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding equity instruments.   Derivative Liabilities   The Company has certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10
- Derivative and Hedging - Contract in Entity’s Own Equity . This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on debt extinguishment.
9 Table of Contents   ALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)   In July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of the ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.   Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share   Pursuant to ASC 260-10-45, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of common stock issuable for stock options and stock warrants (using the treasury stock method), convertible notes and common stock issuable. These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future.   The potentially dilutive common stock equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were included in the dilutive income (loss) per share calculation. The following were the computation of diluted shares outstanding and in periods where the Company has a net income, all dilutive securities were included.       December 31,       2022     2021   Common Stock Equivalents:             Stock warrants     1,600,000       1,600,000   Convertible notes     97,683,720,952       24,321,697,816   Total     97,685,320,952       24,323,297,816     The following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share:       Three Months Ended December 31,       2022     2021   Income per common share - basic:             Net income attributable to All For One Media Corp.   $ 758,467     $ 5,343,417   Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic     8,265,965,907       4,391,606,717                     Net income per common share - basic:   $ 0.00     $ 0.00                     Income (Loss) per common share - diluted:                 Net income (loss) attributable to All For One Media Corp.   $ 758,467     $ 5,343,417   Add: interest on debt     227,193       442,037   Add: initial derivative expense     -       123,743   Add: loss on extinguishment of debt, net     7,120       48,570   Less: gain from change in fair value of derivative liabilities     ( 1,116,376

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)   Income Taxes   The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740-10”), which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.   Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.   The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25, “Definition of Settlement”, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they are filed. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations nor has it had any federal or state examinations since its inception. The Company’s 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019 tax years may still be subject to federal and state tax examination.   Stock-Based Compensation   Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, Share-Based Payment, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments non-employees, compensation expense is determined at the measurement date defined as the earlier of: a) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or b) the date at which the counterparty’s performance is complete.   The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third parties are then revalued, or the total compensation is recalculated, based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.   Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements   In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-65, “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (“SFAS No. 160”). This ASC clarifies that a non-controlling (minority) interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable to both the parent and non-controlling interest, with disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statement of the amounts attributed to the parent and to the non-controlling interest. In accordance with ASC 810-10- 45-21, those losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries may exceed their interests in the subsidiary’s equity. The excess and any further losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest shall be attributed to those interests even if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance. During the year ended September 30, 2017, the Company sold 8 Class A units of membership interest in CFTB Movie and assigned 1 Class B unit in CFTB Movie pursuant to a guarantee agreement which resulted in approximately
27 % non-controlling interest. On November 14, 2018, the Company sold 1and ¼ Class A units of membership interest in CFTB Movie to a director of the Company for $ 125,000
increasing the non-controlling interest to approximately
29.9 %. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company recorded a non-controlling interest balance of $( 401,305 ) and $( 400,173 ), respectively, in connection with the majority-owned subsidiaries, CFTB Movie and CFTB GA as reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets and loss attributable to non-controlling interest of $ 1,132
and $ 1,119
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations.
11 Table of Contents   ALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)   Equity Method Investment   The Company accounts for investments in which the Company owns more than 20% or has the ability to exercise significant influence of the investee but the investee does not qualify for consolidation, using the equity method in accordance with ASC Topic 323,
Investments—Equity Method . Under the equity method, an investor initially records an investment in the stock of an investee at cost and adjusts the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the investor’s share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition. The amount of the adjustment is included in the determination of net income by the investor, and such amount reflects adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated statements including adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses, and to amortize, if appropriate, any difference between investor cost and underlying equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment. The investment of an investor is also adjusted to reflect the investor’s share of changes in the investee’s capital. Dividends received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of the investment has occurred which is other than temporary, and which should be recognized even though the decrease in value is in excess of what would otherwise be recognized by application of the equity method.   In accordance with ASC 323-10-35-20 through 35-22, the investor ordinarily shall discontinue applying the equity method if the investment (and net advances) is reduced to zero and shall not provide for additional losses unless the investor has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support for the investee. An investor shall, however, provide for additional losses if the imminent return to profitable operations by an investee appears to be assured. For example, a material, nonrecurring loss of an isolated nature may reduce an investment below zero even though the underlying profitable operating pattern of an investee is unimpaired. If the investee subsequently reports net income, the investor shall resume applying the equity method only after its share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended.   Equity method investments are classified as investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company periodically evaluates its equity and cost method investments for impairment due to declines considered to be other than temporary. If the Company determines that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, then a charge to earnings is recorded as an impairment loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.    Revenue Recognition   ASU Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 606”),
the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.   The Company recognized revenue of $ 2,402
and $ 2,313
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from streaming music sales. The Company markets their master song recordings through online music streaming websites and recognizes revenues on a net basis once the songs are downloaded by the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts on an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exceptions. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and it did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
12 Table of Contents   ALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The new ASU addresses issuer’s accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options. This amendment is effective for all entities, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-04 during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and it did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.   In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging—Portfolio Layer Method. Current GAAP permits only prepayable financial assets and one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of prepayable financial instruments to be included in a last-of-layer closed portfolio. The amendments in ASU 2022-01 allow 3 non-prepayable financial assets also to be included in a closed portfolio hedged using the portfolio layer method. That expanded scope permits an entity to apply the same portfolio hedging method to both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets, thereby allowing consistent accounting for similar hedges.   The amendments in ASU 2022-01 clarify the accounting for and promote consistency in the reporting of hedge basis adjustments applicable to both a single hedged layer and multiple hedged layers as follows:     1. An entity is required to maintain basis adjustments in an existing hedge on a closed portfolio basis (that is, not allocated to individual assets).         2. An entity is required to immediately recognize and present the basis adjustment associated with the amount of the dedesignated layer that was breached in interest income. In addition, an entity is required to disclose that amount and the circumstances that led to the breach.         3. An entity is required to disclose the total amount of the basis adjustments in existing hedges as a reconciling amount if other areas of GAAP require the disaggregated disclosure of the amortized cost basis of assets included in the closed portfolio.         4. An entity is prohibited from considering basis adjustments in an existing hedge when determining credit losses.   For public business entities, amendments in ASU 2022-01 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted on any date on or after the issuance of ASU 2022-01 for any entity that has adopted the amendments in ASU 2017-12 for the corresponding period. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, the effect of adopting the amendments related to basis adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption (that is, the initial application date). The Company early adopted ASU 2022-01 during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and it did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.   Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.   NOTE 3 -
GOING CONCERN   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company had net income of $ 757,335
and $5,343,417 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in operations of $ 83,230
and $ 211,828 , respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily a result of the non-cash gain from change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $ 1,116,376 . Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 24,949,796 , working capital deficit of $ 14,770,520
and a stockholders’ deficit of $ 14,908,020
as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 2,832,637
of gross convertible notes and $ 2,472,500
of gross notes payable outstanding. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future such as selling the completed Movie and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations.
13 Table of Contents   ALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)   The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues, there can be no assurances to that effect.   NOTE 4 -

Pursuant to the Amendment Agreements, the Parties agreed to extend the maturity dated of all these convertible notes to December 31, 2022 and waived any penalty interest that would otherwise have occurred due to the failure to timely repay the convertible notes on or prior to the original maturity date. In December 2022, the Parties extended the maturity date of these convertible and non-convertible date to March 31, 2023. All other terms of the convertible notes not modified in the Amendment Agreements shall remain in full force and effect.   As of December 31, 2022, the Company had defaulted on certain convertible notes payable with aggregate outstanding principal amount of $ 1,047,821 .

Additionally, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Convertible Notes and Warrants outstanding were accounted for as derivatives as the Company does not have sufficient authorized shares to cover these dilutive securities.

and $ 5,384,980
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the derivative liabilities was estimated at issuance, upon revaluation, and on December 31, 2022 and 2021, using the Binomial Lattice valuation model with the following assumptions:       2023     2022   Dividend rate   — %   — % Term (in years)   0.01 to

As of December 31, 2022, we had defaulted on 6 of these convertible notes payable with aggregate outstanding principal amount of $1,047,821.   Cash Flows   Changes in our cash balance are summarized as follows:       Three Months Ended December 31,       2022     2021   Net cash used in operating activities   $ (83,230
)   $ (211,828

We require additional financing to fund our current operations for fiscal 2023. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.   If we are unable to raise the funds required to fund our operations, we will seek alternative financing through other means, such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need for our operations from the sale of our securities. We have not located any sources for these funds and may not be able to do so in the future. We expect that we will seek additional financing in the future. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to cease operations. If we fail to raise funds, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws.     36 Table of Contents   Going Concern   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company had net income loss of $757,335 and $5,343,417 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in operations of $83,230 and $211,828, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily a result of the non-cash gain from change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $1,116,376. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $24,949,796, working capital deficit of $14,770,520 and a stockholders’ deficit of $14,908,020 as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $2,832,637 of gross convertible notes and $2,472,500 of gross notes payable outstanding. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future such as selling the completed Movie and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations.   The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues, there can be no assurances to that effect.   Critical Accounting Policies   The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.   Use of Estimates   In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include but are not limited to the fair value of common stock issued for services, the valuation of derivative liabilities, the valuation of stock-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets.   Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments   FASB ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to the Company on September 30, 2022. Accordingly, the estimates presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).   The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:   Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.   Level 2: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.   Level 3: Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.     37 Table of Contents   The carrying amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets for cash, due from and to related parties, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.   In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13,” Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements”, which will improve the effectiveness of disclosure requirements for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements, and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. During the period ended March 31, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2018-13. This guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   Derivative Liabilities   The Company has certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10
– Derivative and Hedging – Contract in Entity’s Own Equity . This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on debt extinguishment.   In July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of the ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.   Stock-Based Compensation   Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, Share-Based Payment, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments non-employees, compensation expense is determined at the measurement date defined as the earlier of: a) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or b) the date at which the counterparty’s performance is complete.   The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third parties are then revalued, or the total compensation is recalculated, based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.   Revenue Recognition   The Company adopted and implemented on October 1, 2018, ASU Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 606”). ASU 606 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   Upon implementation of ASU 606, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
38 Table of Contents   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item.   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the 1934 Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company’s limited resources and limited number of employees, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   We may be involved from time to time in ordinary litigation, negotiation and settlement matters that will not have a material effect on our operations or finances. We are not aware of any pending legal proceedings against us or our officers and directors in their capacity as such that could have a material impact on our operations or finances.   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item. We refer readers to our Form 10-K for additional risk factor disclosures.   An occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations.   The occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our goods and services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   ITEM 2.
