CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended December
31, 2022 (the “Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements
are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from
liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact
included in this Report, or incorporated by reference into this Report, are forward-looking statements. Throughout this Report, we have
attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as “may,” “believe,” “will,”
“could,” “project,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “should,”
“continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecasts,” “goal,” “seek,”
“intend,” other forms of these words or similar words or expressions or the negative thereof. Additionally, statements concerning
future matters such as our expected earnings, revenues, expenses and financial condition, our expectations with respect to the development
of new products, expectations regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other statements regarding matters that are not historical
are forward-looking statements.
We have based our forward-looking statements on management’s
current expectations and projections about trends affecting our business and industry and other future events. Although we do not make
forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Forward-looking
statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business, financial condition, results of operations
or performance to differ materially from our historical results or those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement contained
in this Report. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects or which could cause actual
results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors” in
Item 1A of Part II of this Report, as such factors may be updated, amended or superseded from time to time by subsequent public filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, actual results may differ as a result of additional risks and uncertainties
of which we are currently unaware or which we do not currently view as material to our business.
You should read this Report in its entirety,
together with the documents that we file as exhibits to this Report, with the understanding that our future results may be materially
different from what we currently expect. The forward-looking statements we make speak only as of the date on which they are made. We expressly

LANTRONIX, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2022
1. Company and Significant Accounting Policies
Company
Lantronix, Inc., which we refer to herein as the Company, Lantronix,
we, our, or us, is a global Industrial and Enterprise internet of things (“IoT”) provider of solutions that target diversified
verticals ranging from Smart Cities, Utilities and Healthcare to Enterprise, Intelligent Transportation, and Industrial Automation. Building
on a long history of connectivity and video processing competence, target applications include Video Surveillance, Traffic management,
Infotainment systems, Robotics, Edge Computing and Remote Environment Management (“REM”).
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
of Lantronix have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for
interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2022, which was filed with the SEC on August 29, 2022. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring
accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position of Lantronix
at December 31, 2022, the consolidated results of our operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and our consolidated
cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accounting measurements at interim dates inherently involve greater reliance
on estimates than at year-end.
The results of operations for the three and six months ended December
31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Contracts
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a
business combination by addressing diversity and inconsistency related to (i) recognition of an acquired contract liability and (ii) payment
terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The amendments in this ASU require that an entity (acquirer)
recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with existing revenue
recognition guidance under Accounting Standard Codification Topic (“ASC”) 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer would
assess how the acquiree applied ASC 606 to determine what to record for the acquired revenue contracts. Generally, this would result in
an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and
measured in the acquiree’s financial statements. Lantronix adopted this ASU in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June
30, 2023, and as such, we recorded applicable contract assets and liabilities acquired in the Uplogix acquisition (see
Note 3 )
in accordance with this ASU.
9
Current Expected Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new ASU requiring financial assets
measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted
from the amortized cost basis. The ASU eliminates the threshold for initial recognition in current U.S. GAAP and reflects an entity’s
current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on historical experience, current conditions,
and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets. The ASU is effective for Lantronix beginning
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.
2. Revenue
Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
We apply the following five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (i) identifying the contract
with a customer, (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation
is satisfied. On occasion we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally
capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized net of (i) any taxes collected from customers,
which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities and (ii) shipping and handling costs collected from customers.
Products
Most of our product revenue is recognized as a distinct single performance
obligation when products are tendered to a carrier for delivery, which represents the point in time that our customer obtains control
of the promised products. A smaller portion of our product revenue is recognized when our customer receives delivery of the promised products.
A significant portion of our products are sold to distributors under
agreements which contain (i) limited rights to return unsold products and (ii) price adjustment provisions, both of which are accounted
for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We base our estimates for returns and price adjustments
primarily on historical experience; however, we also consider contractual allowances, approved pricing adjustments and other known or
anticipated returns and price adjustments in a given period. Such estimates are generally made at the time of shipment to the customer
and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable
that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur. Our estimates of accrued variable consideration are included in
other current liabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Services
Revenues from our extended warranty, technical support and maintenance
services are generally recognized ratably over the applicable service period. Although not significant to date, revenues from sales of
our SaaS solutions are recognized ratably over the applicable service period as well.
We prepay sales commissions related to certain of these
contracts, which are incremental costs of obtaining the contract. We capitalize these costs and expense them ratably on a
straight-line basis over the life of the contract. At December 31, 2022, prepaid sales commissions included in prepaid expenses and
other current assets totaled $ 112,000
and included in other assets totaled $ 134,000 .
10
Engineering Services
We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering and related consulting
service contracts with customers. Revenues from professional engineering services are generally recognized as services are performed.
These contracts generally include performance obligations in which control is transferred over time because the customer either simultaneously
receives and consumes the benefits provided or our performance on the contract creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls.
These contracts typically provide services on the following basis:
·
Time & Materials (“T&M”) – services consist of revenues from software modification, consulting implementation, training and integration services. These services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary depending on the actual time and materials incurred based on the customer’s needs.
·
Fixed Price – arrangements to render specific consulting and software modification services which tend to be more complex.
Performance obligations for T&M contracts qualify for the "Right
to Invoice" practical expedient within the revenue guidance. Under this practical expedient, we may recognize revenue, over time,
in the amount to which we have a right to invoice. In addition, we are not required to estimate variable consideration upon inception
of the contract and reassess the estimate each reporting period. We have determined that this method best represents the transfer of services
as, upon billing, we have a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer
of our performance completed to date.
We recognize revenue on fixed price contracts, over time, using
an input method based on the proportion of our actual costs incurred (generally labor hours expended) to the total costs expected to
complete the contract performance obligation. We have determined that this method best represents the transfer of services as the
proportion closely depicts the efforts or inputs completed towards the satisfaction of a fixed price contract performance
obligation.
Multiple Performance Obligations
From time to time, we may enter into contracts with customers that
include promises to transfer multiple deliverables that may include sales of products, professional engineering services and other product
qualification or certification services. Determining whether the deliverables in such arrangements are considered distinct performance
obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together often requires judgment. We consider performance obligations to be
distinct when the customer can benefit from the promised good or service on its own or by combining it with other resources readily available
and when the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promised goods or services in the contract. In such arrangements,
we allocate revenue on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone
selling price for each performance obligation.
Net Revenue by Product Line and Geographic Region
We organize our products and solutions into three product lines: Embedded
IoT Solutions, IoT System Solutions, and Software & Services. Our Embedded IoT products are normally embedded into new designs. These
products include application processing that delivers compute to meet customer needs for data transformation, computer vision, machine
learning, augmented / virtual reality, audio / video aggregation and distribution, and custom applications at the edge. Our IoT System
products include wired and wireless connections that enhance the value and utility of modern electronic systems and equipment by providing
secure network connectivity, power for IoT end devices through Power over Ethernet (PoE), application hosting, protocol conversion, media
conversion, secure access for distributed IoT deployments and many other functions. Our Software & Services products can be classified
as either (i) our SaaS platform, which enables customers to easily deploy, monitor, manage, and automate across their global deployments,
all from a single platform login, virtually connected as though directly on each device, (ii) engineering services, which is a flexible
business model that allows customers to select from turnkey product development or team augmentation for accelerating complex areas of
product development or (iii) extended warranty, support and maintenance.
We conduct our business globally and manage our sales teams by three
geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific Japan (“APJ”).

Contract Balances
In certain instances, the timing of revenue recognition may differ
from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record a contract asset receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, and
a contract or deferred revenue liability when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. With respect to product shipments, we expect
to fulfill contract obligations within one year and so we have elected not to separately disclose the amount nor the timing of recognition
of these remaining performance obligations. For contract balances related to contracts that include services and multiple performance
obligations, refer to the deferred revenue discussion below.
12
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of unearned revenue related
to our extended warranty, support and maintenance services and certain software services. These services are generally invoiced at the
beginning of the contract period and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period. Current and non-current deferred revenue balances
represent revenue allocated to the remaining unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of a reporting period and are respectively
included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The following table presents the changes in our deferred revenue balance

3. Acquisition
On September 12, 2022 (the “Closing
Date”), we entered into a Merger Agreement with Uplogix, Inc. (“Uplogix”) pursuant to which Uplogix became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Lantronix. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Uplogix were cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an applicable portion of the Consideration Pool Amount (as defined in the Merger Agreement). In addition, the
holders of promissory notes issued by Uplogix entered into note termination agreements with Uplogix, which provided, among other things,
that the issued and outstanding promissory notes were cancelled and terminated upon the closing of the Merger. Holders of Company Junior-Only
Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received, in connection with their cancellation and termination of such notes, the full payment
of principal and interest. Holders of Company Senior Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement), including those holders of Company Senior
Notes and Company Junior Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the “Company Senior Noteholders”), received the applicable
portions of the Estimated Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
The aggregate consideration payable by Lantronix
under the Merger Agreement was equal to $8,000,000 (inclusive of payments to satisfy the Company Junior-Only Notes), subject to certain
adjustments, including, without limitation, for cash, debt, transaction expenses (including the Bonus Amount (as defined below)) and net
working capital. Prior to the Closing Date, Uplogix entered into an amended and restated bonus plan, which provided that certain of its
employees would be entitled to receive, in the aggregate, 15% of the consideration otherwise payable to the holders of Company Senior
Notes (the “Bonus Amount”) under the Merger Agreement, with the terms of such bonus payments (including the amounts per employee
and the timing of such payments) as specified in such bonus plan.
In addition, the Company Senior Noteholders
and former Uplogix employees have the right to receive up to an additional $4,000,000 in the aggregate (the “Earnout Amount”),
payable after the closing of the Merger based on revenue targets for the business of Uplogix as specified in the Merger Agreement. The
Earnout Amount will be based on Uplogix achieving revenue (subject to certain adjustments as specified in the Merger Agreement) of $7,000,000
to $14,000,000 for the period beginning at the Closing Date and ending on September 30, 2023. The Company Senior Noteholders are entitled
to an advance of the Earnout Amount if the revenue of the Uplogix business for the period beginning at the closing of the Merger and ending
on March 31, 2023 is between $7,000,000 to $14,000,000, but in no event will the Earnout Amount, together with any such advance of the
Earnout Amount, exceed $4,000,000.
The acquisition of the Uplogix brings immediate scale to our out-of-band
remote management solutions, adding a complementary high-end product offering that includes high-margin maintenance and licensing revenues.

We recorded Uplogix’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities
based on their estimated fair values as of the Closing Date and allocated the remaining purchase consideration to goodwill. Our valuation
assumptions of acquired assets and assumed liabilities require significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. Updates
to the valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed may result in changes to the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities,
with corresponding adjustments to goodwill in subsequent periods. We expect to complete the purchase price allocation within 12 months
of the Closing Date.

As discussed above, the purchase consideration, and resulting purchase
price allocation for this acquisition included various adjustments for transaction expenses, the Bonus Amount, payment of Company Junior-Only
Notes and certain other accrued expenses paid shortly after the Closing Date. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, substantially all of the
$4,103,000 cash acquired was to be utilized for these items. The purchase price allocation above reflects both this cash acquired and
the applicable accrued liabilities and notes payable that were substantially all disbursed on or shortly after the Closing Date.
The factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition
of goodwill include our belief that this acquisition will create a more diverse IoT company with respect to product offerings and our
belief that we are committed to improving cost structures in accordance with our operational and restructuring plans which should result
in a realization of cost savings and an improvement of overall efficiencies.
Depending on the structure of a particular acquisition, goodwill and
identifiable intangible assets may not be deductible for tax purposes. We have preliminarily determined that goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets related to this acquisition are deductible.
Acquisition-related costs were expensed in the periods in which the
costs were incurred.
The valuation of identifiable intangible assets and their estimated
useful lives are as follows:

The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the

Valuation Methodology
The customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess
earnings method, which estimates revenues and cash flows derived from this asset and also considers portions of the cash flows that can
be attributed to the use of other supporting assets. The useful lives of customer relationships are estimated based primarily upon customer
turnover data. Order backlog was estimated to be substantially fulfilled within a year of the Closing Date.
Developed technology and trades names were valued using the relief-from-royalty
method. This method is an income approach that estimates the portion of a company’s earnings attributable to an asset based on the
royalty rate the company would have paid for the use of the asset if it did not own it. Royalty payments are estimated by applying a royalty
rate to the prospective revenue attributable to the intangible asset. The resulting annual royalty payments are tax-affected and then
discounted to present value.
Assumptions used in forecasting cash flows for
each of the identified intangible assets included consideration of the following:
·
Historical performance including sales and profitability
·
Business prospects and industry expectations
·
Estimated economic life of the asset
·
Development of new technologies
·
Acquisition of new customers
·
Attrition of existing customers
·
Obsolescence of technology over time
The fair value of earnout consideration was estimated based on applying
a Monte Carlo simulation method to forecast achievement of the revenue targets. This method involves many possible value outcomes which
are evaluated to establish an estimated value. Key inputs in the valuation include forecasted revenue, revenue volatility and discount
rate.
Remeasurement of Earnout Consideration
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a remeasurement
adjustment of $ 673,000
to reduce the acquisition date preliminary estimated earnout consideration fair value of $ 1,718,000
down to $ 1,045,000 .
This adjustment was recorded based on our updated expectations of achieving the revenue targets for the business of Uplogix. The remeasurement
adjustment was recorded within our operating expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Supplemental Pro Forma Information
The following supplemental pro forma data summarizes our results of
operations for the periods presented, as if we completed the acquisition of Uplogix as of the first day of our fiscal year ended
June 30, 2022. The supplemental pro forma data reports actual operating results adjusted to include the pro forma effect and timing of
the impact of amortization expense of identified intangible assets, restructuring costs, the purchase accounting effect on inventories
acquired, and transaction costs. In accordance with the pro forma acquisition date, we recorded in the six months ended December 31, 2021
supplemental pro forma data (i) cost of goods sold from manufacturing profit in acquired inventory of $ 104,000 , (ii) acquisition
related restructuring costs of $ 297,000
and (iii) acquisition-related costs of $ 315,000 , with a corresponding reduction in the six months
ended December 31, 2022 supplemental pro forma data. Additionally, we recorded $ 319,000
of amortization expense in the six months ended
December 31, 2021 supplemental pro forma data, and additional amortization expense of $ 38,000
in the six months ended December 31, 2022
supplemental pro forma data to represent amortization for the full fiscal year-to-date period.
Net revenue related to products and services from the acquisition of
Uplogix contributed slightly over 3% to our total net revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022. As of the Closing Date, we began
to immediately integrate the acquisition into existing operations, engineering groups, sales distribution networks and management structure,
making it generally impracticable to determine the post-acquisition earnings on a standalone basis.

6. Bank Loan Agreements
On September 7, 2022 we entered into a Third
Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amendment”) with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”),
pertaining to our existing term loan and revolving credit facility (together, the “Senior Credit Facilities), which amends that
certain Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 2, 2021, as amended by the First Amendment to Third
Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of October 21, 2021, as amended by the Second Amendment to Third Amended and
Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2022 by and among Lantronix and SVB (collectively with the Amendment, the
“Loan Agreement”).
The Amendment, among other things, provided
for an additional term loan in the original principal amount of $ 5,000,000
that matures on
August 2, 2025 . The additional term loan bears
interest at
Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“ SOFR”) or the Prime Rate,
at the option of Lantronix, plus a margin that ranges from 3.10% to 4.10% in the case of Term SOFR and 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of the
Prime Rate, depending on our total leverage with a Term SOFR floor of 1.50% and a Prime Rate floor of 3.25%. The Amendment reduces the
minimum liquidity requirement from $ 5,000,000
to $ 4,000,000 . As a condition to entering into the Amendment, we were obligated to pay a
nonrefundable facility increase fee in the amount of $ 25,000 .
On September 7, 2022 we also borrowed $ 2,000,000
on our revolving credit facility.
The following table summarizes our outstanding debt under the Senior
Credit Facilities:

Financial Covenants
The Senior Credit Facilities require Lantronix to comply with a minimum
liquidity test, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. We are currently in compliance with all financial
covenants.
Liquidity
The Senior Credit Facilities require that we maintain a
minimum liquidity
of $4,000,000 at SVB, as measured at the end of each month.
Maximum leverage ratio
The Senior Credit Facilities require that
we maintain a maximum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of funded debt to the consolidated trailing 12 month earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain other allowable exclusions of (i) 2.50 to 1.00 for each calendar quarter ending June
30, 2021 through and including September 30, 2022, (ii) 2.25 to 1.00 for each calendar quarter ending December 31, 2022 through and including
September 30, 2023, and (iii) 2.00 to 1.00 for the calendar quarter December 31, 2023 and each calendar quarter thereafter.
Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio
The Senior Credit Facilities require that
we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of consolidated trailing 12 month earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain other allowable exclusions, less capital expenditures and taxes paid, to the trailing
twelve month principal and interest payments on all funded debt of 1.25 to 1.00 as measured at the end of each calendar quarter.
In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities
contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict Lantronix
and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, dispose of assets, make investments, make certain restricted payments,
merge or consolidate and enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements. The Senior Credit Facilities include a number of events
of default, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other materials indebtedness, bankruptcy
and insolvency defaults and material judgment defaults. If any event of default occurs (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace
periods), the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding amounts under the Senior
Credit Facilities may become due and payable immediately.

8. Income Taxes
We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The

The difference between our effective tax rates in the periods presented
above and the federal statutory rate is primarily due to a tax benefit from our domestic losses being recorded with a full valuation allowance,
as well as the effect of foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal statutory rate.
We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe it is more
likely than not that these assets will be realized. Due to our cumulative losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income,
we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
9. Commitments and Contingencies
From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings and
claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. However, regardless of the outcome, litigation can
have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management time and resources, and other factors.
California Corporate Headquarters Lease
In July 2022, we commenced the lease of approximately 14,000 square
feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Irvine, California. The term of the lease is 84 months from the commencement date,
with an option to extend the lease for one 60-month extension period at a basic rent to be agreed upon by the parties or determined pursuant
to the lease. The initial basic rent payable is $28,900 per month and is subject to customary annual rent increases. The aggregate basic
rent payable under the lease during the 84-month term is approximately $ 2,700,000 . We are also obligated to pay as additional rent our
proportionate share of operating expenses, including property taxes. Additionally, the lease required us to deliver to the landlord an
irrevocable stand-by letter of credit in the amount of $ 50,000
as security in the case of default.
We accounted for this lease as an operating
lease in accordance with ASC 842. Upon commencement of the lease, we recorded a right-of-use asset of $2,852,000 and lease liability of
$2,852,000 at the inception of the lease based upon a discount rate of 4.6% over a term of 7 years.

Acquisition
On September 12, 2022 we acquired Uplogix, Inc. (“Uplogix”)
for an aggregate purchase price of $8,000,000, subject to certain adjustments, plus an earnout up to an additional $4,000,000 depending
on the achievement of certain revenue targets of the business of Uplogix through September 30, 2023. Uplogix brings immediate scale to
our out-of-band remote management solutions, adding a complementary high-end product offering that includes high-margin maintenance and
licensing revenues.

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference, for
additional discussions regarding the acquisition of Uplogix.
COVID-19 Update
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken measures
to protect the health and safety of our employees and comply with applicable local directives. Most of our employees transitioned to remote
working arrangements commencing in March 2020, and many continue to primarily work remotely as of the date hereof. We continue to monitor
the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, as well as our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses, including
the emergence of new strains of the virus, current or future government-imposed shutdowns, and the impact of ongoing vaccination efforts.
Our supply chain still faces challenges, as most of our manufacturing
is performed in Thailand, Taiwan and China. While we have seen some improvement in the global supply chain challenges over the last three
to six months, including certain freight and logistics costs, and shipping lead times, the recent increase in COVID-19 infections in China
causes uncertainty in supply availability.
Overall, in light of the changing nature and continuing uncertainty
around the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in future periods remains limited.

Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of recent
accounting pronouncements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The accounting policies that have the greatest impact on our financial
condition and results of operations and that require the most judgment are those relating to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful
accounts, inventory valuation, warranty reserves, restructuring charges, valuation of deferred income taxes, business combinations, goodwill
and intangible assets and stock-based compensation. These policies are described in further detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended June 30, 2022 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 29, 2022 (the “Form
10-K”) and have not changed significantly during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to what was previously disclosed
in the Form 10-K.

Results of Operations – Three Months
Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Summary
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, our net revenue decreased
by $2,175,000 or 6.5%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net revenue was driven by a 12.4% decrease
in net revenue in our Embedded IoT Solutions product line, as well as an 8.9% decrease in net revenue in our IoT System Solutions product
line; these decreases were partially offset by a 71.0% increase in net revenues in our Software and Services product line. We had a net
loss of $2,609,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net loss of $2,395,000 for the three months ended December
31, 2021. The increase in net loss was primarily driven by the decrease in revenues coupled with only a 1.7% decrease in operating expenses
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Embedded IoT Solutions
Net revenue decreased primarily due to reduced
unit sales of our wireless communications product line across all regions and our embedded ethernet connectivity products in the EMEA
and APJ regions. These decreases were partially offset by revenue growth in our network interface cards (“NICs”) & optics
products in the Americas region.
IoT System Solutions
Net revenue decreased primarily due to reduced
unit sales of our device management/out-of-band products and our media converter products, mostly in the Americas region. These decreases
were partially offset by an increase in sales of our network switches, primarily in the Americas region.
Software & Services
Net revenue increased primarily due to an
increase in our extended warranty services in the Americas region, mostly as a result of the Uplogix acquisition.
25
Gross Profit
Gross profit represents net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue
consists primarily of the cost of raw material components, subcontract labor assembly from contract manufacturers, direct and indirect
personnel expenses related to professional services, manufacturing overhead, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete products or raw
materials, warranty costs, royalties and share-based compensation.

Gross profit as a percent of revenue (referred to as “gross margin”)
increased slightly due primarily to our sales mix. As compared to the prior year period, in the current quarter we experienced higher
revenues from our high-margin extended warranty services, mostly from the Uplogix acquisition, as well as increased unit sales of some
of our NICs and optics products, which typically carry a higher margin than our other embedded solutions.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related
expenses, including salaries and commissions, share-based compensation, facility expenses, information technology, trade show expenses,
advertising, and legal and accounting fees.

Results of Operations – Six Months Ended
December 31, 2022 Compared to the Six Months Ended December 31, 2021
Summary
In the six months ended December 31, 2022, our net revenue increased
by $1,915,000 or 3.1%, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 28.9% increase
in net revenue in our Software & Services product line, as well as a 2.8% increase in net revenue in our Embedded IoT Solutions product
line. We had a net loss of $4,262,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net loss of $4,678,000 for the six months
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net loss was primarily driven by the increase in revenues partially offset by an increase in
operating expenses of $910,000 or 3.0% during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.

Embedded IoT Solutions
Net revenue increased primarily due to organic
growth in our compute modules in the APJ and EMEA regions as well as increased sales of our NICs and optics products, primarily in the
Americas region. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of our wireless communications products across all regions.
IoT System Solutions
Net revenue was flat for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 when compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. We saw an increase in revenues from our network switches in
the Americas region, substantially offset by a decrease in our out-of-band products in the Americas region and, to a lesser extent, EMEA.
Software & Services
Net revenue increased primarily due to an
increase in our extended warranty services in the Americas region, mostly as a result of the Uplogix acquisition.

Restructuring, Severance and Related Charges
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred charges
of approximately $174,000 related to headcount reductions and restructuring of certain non-essential operations.
We may incur additional restructuring, severance and related charges
in future periods as we continue to identify cost savings and synergies related to our acquisitions and general business operations.
29
Acquisition-Related Costs
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately
$315,000 of costs primarily in connection with the acquisition of Uplogix. These costs were mainly comprised of banking, legal and other
professional fees.
Interest Income (Expense), Net
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred net interest
expense due to borrowings on our credit facilities. We also earn interest income on our domestic cash balance.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Our other income (expense), net, is comprised primarily of foreign
currency remeasurement and transaction adjustments related to our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.

In September 2022 we entered into an amendment to our Senior Credit
Facilities (as defined in
Note 6
of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1
of this Report) which provide for an additional term loan in the original principal amount of $5,000,000 that matures on August 2, 2025.
We also borrowed $2,000,000 on our revolving credit facility.
Our principal sources of cash and liquidity include our existing cash
and cash equivalents, borrowings and amounts available under our loan agreement with our bank, and cash generated from operations. We
believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund our current requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other financial
commitments for at least the next 12 months and beyond. We anticipate that the primary factors affecting our cash and liquidity are net
revenue, working capital requirements and capital expenditures.
We define cash and cash equivalents as highly liquid deposits with
original maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. We maintain cash and cash equivalents balances at certain financial institutions
in excess of amounts insured by federal agencies. Management does not believe this concentration subjects us to any unusual financial
risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships. We frequently monitor the third-party depository institutions
that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those
funds.
30
Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors,
including the following: timing and amount of our net revenue; our product mix and the resulting gross margins; research and development
expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; and expenses associated with any strategic partnerships, acquisitions or infrastructure
investments.
From time to time, we may seek additional capital from public or private
offerings of our capital stock, borrowings under our existing or future credit lines or other sources in order to (i) develop or enhance
our products, (ii) take advantage of strategic opportunities, (iii) respond to competition or (iv) continue to operate our business. We
currently have a Form S-3 shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds,
our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to
those of our existing stockholders. If we issue debt securities to raise additional funds, we may incur debt service obligations, become
subject to additional restrictions that limit or restrict our ability to operate our business, or be required to further encumber our
assets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

Operating Activities
Cash used in operating activities during the six months ended December
31, 2022 increased compared to the prior year period. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, our net loss included $6,831,000 of
non-cash charges, while the changes in operating assets and liabilities used net cash of $12,520,000.
Our net inventories increased by $11,477,000, or 30.5%, from June 30,
2022 to December 31, 2022. Of this increase, $3,590,000 of net inventories were acquired in the Uplogix acquisition. The remainder of
the increase resulted primarily from a build-up of critical long-lead time components as we continue to experience lead time and supply
constraints, as well as raw materials acquired to fulfill future demand on a new customer supply agreement that we executed in January
2023.
Accounts payable decreased by $3,927,000, or 19.0%, from June 30, 2022
to December 31, 2022, which was slightly offset by the acquisition of $278,000 of accounts payable from the Uplogix acquisition. The reduction
is primarily due to the timing of our inventory purchases and related payments to our vendors.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December
31, 2022 was driven by the acquisition of Uplogix, which used net cash of $4,650,000. We also used $1,994,000 for the purchase of property
and equipment, primarily related to building out and furnishing our new lease facilities in California and Minnesota.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended
December 31, 2022 resulted primarily from
$7,000,000 in gross proceeds received from our credit facilities with SVB. The increase
in cash was partially offset by principal payments on the senior credit facility, as well as tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees
for restricted shares.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December
31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level.
(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter
ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting with the exception of the modification of certain existing internal controls over financial reporting and implementation of new
control activities and business processes resulting from the October 2022 implementation of our new enterprise resource planning (ERP)
system.
We believe that the new ERP system and related changes to
internal controls and business processes will enhance our internal control over financial reporting while providing us the ability to
scale our business. We have taken steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during the second
fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 and will continue to evaluate the operating effectiveness of related key controls in subsequent periods.
(c) Inherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
Refer to
Note 9
of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of legal
proceedings.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors
We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous
risks and uncertainties. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described
in this section, as well as other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC. This section should be read
in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in Item 1 of this
Report, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item
2 of this Report. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part
of your investment. In addition, risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely
affect our business.
The risks and uncertainties discussed below update and supersede
the risks and uncertainties previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2022, which was filed with the SEC on August 29, 2022.  There have been no material changes to the risks and uncertainties previously
disclosed in such Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for the addition of the new section “Increasing attention on environmental,
social and governance matters may have a negative impact on our business, impose additional costs on us, and expose us to additional risks,”
as set out below.
Risks Related to Our Operations and Industry
The effect of COVID-19 and other possible
pandemics and similar outbreaks could result in material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the periodic measures intended to
reduce its spread imposed by governments and other authorities around the world, including restrictions on freedom of movement and business
operations such as travel bans, border closings, business limitations and closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, have had,
and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the economy generally, our business and the businesses of our suppliers, and our results
of operations and financial condition. Most of our employees transitioned to remote working arrangements commencing in March 2020, and
many continue to primarily work remotely as of the date hereof, which may ultimately result in lower work efficiency and productivity,
and in turn adversely affect our business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in industry events, trade shows and business travel
being suspended, cancelled and/or significantly curtailed. The cessation of trade shows and business travel resulted in our lead pipeline
being negatively impacted, which has negatively affected our sales since the beginning of the outbreak. While most industry events, trade
shows and business travel have resumed, if these activities are suspended, cancelled and/or significantly curtailed in the future, whether
due to surges of COVID-19 or otherwise related to the pandemic, our sales may continue to be negatively impacted in the future.
33
In addition, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures
to prevent its spread subject us to various risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition, including the following:
·
significant volatility or decreases in the demand for our products or extended sales cycles;
·
changes in customer behavior and preferences, as customers may experience financial difficulties and/or may delay orders or reduce their spending in light of COVID-19;
·
adverse impacts on our ability to distribute or deliver our products or services, including due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on air travel, as well as temporary disruptions, restrictions or closures of the facilities of our suppliers or customers and their contract manufacturers;
·
further disruptions in our contract manufacturers’ ability to manufacture our products, as some contract manufacturers and suppliers of materials used in the production of our products are located in areas more severely impacted by COVID-19, which has limited and could further limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials to produce and manufacture our products; and
·
volatility in the availability of raw materials and components that our contract manufacturers purchase and volatility in raw material and other input costs.
The duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on
our operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this
time, including new information which may emerge concerning the long-term effects of COVID-19, actions taken to contain COVID-19, additional
surges of COVID-19 infections due to the rate of public acceptance and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines or due to new and more contagious
and/or vaccine resistant variants, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after
the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
prospects as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the
future. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.
We have experienced and may in the future experience constraints
in the supply of certain materials and components that could affect our operating results.
Some of our integrated circuits are only available from a single source
and in some cases, are no longer being manufactured. From time to time, integrated circuits, and potentially other components used in
our products, will be phased out of production by the manufacturer. When this happens, we attempt to purchase sufficient inventory to
meet our needs until a substitute component can be incorporated into our products. Nonetheless, we may be unable to purchase sufficient
components to meet our demands, or we may incorrectly forecast our demands, and purchase too many or too few components. In addition,
our products use components that have been in the past and may in the future be subject to market shortages and substantial price fluctuations,
whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the war between Ukraine and Russia, recent tensions between China and Taiwan or otherwise. From
time to time, we have been unable to meet customer orders because we were unable to purchase necessary components for our products. We
do not have long-term supply arrangements with most of our vendors to obtain necessary components, including semiconductor chips, or technology
for our products and instead purchase components on a purchase order basis. If we are unable to purchase components from these suppliers,
our product shipments could be prevented or delayed, which could result in a loss of sales. If we are unable to meet existing orders or
to enter into new orders because of a shortage in components, we will likely lose net revenue, risk losing customers and risk harm to
our reputation in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For instance,
we have recently experienced increased delays in shipments of semiconductor chips. As a result, we have sought alternate sources of certain
components, which have been at a higher cost. Because semiconductor chips continue to be subject to an ongoing significant shortage, our
ability to source components that use semiconductor chips has been adversely affected. These supply interruptions have resulted in increased
component delivery lead times and increased costs to obtain components with available semiconductor chips. To the extent this semiconductor
chip shortage or other shortages continue, the production of our products may be impacted.
34
Future operating results depend upon our ability to timely obtain
components in sufficient quantities and on acceptable terms.
We and our contract manufacturers are responsible for procuring raw
materials for our products. Our products incorporate some components and technologies that are only available from single or limited sources
of supply. Depending on a limited number of suppliers exposes us to risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality
and delivery schedules. Moreover, due to our limited sales, we may not be able to convince suppliers to continue to make components available
to us unless there is demand for these components from their other customers. If any one or more of our suppliers cease to provide us
with sufficient quantities of components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, we would have to seek alternative sources of
supply and we may have difficulty identifying additional or replacement suppliers for some of our components.
We outsource substantially all of our manufacturing to contract
manufacturers in Asia. If our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products at the quality and quantity we
request, our business could be harmed.
We use contract manufacturers based in Asia to manufacture substantially
all of our products. Generally, we do not have guaranteed supply agreements with our contract manufacturers or suppliers. If any of these
subcontractors or suppliers were to cease doing business with us, we might not be able to obtain alternative sources in a timely or cost-effective
manner. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers, especially in countries outside of the U.S., exposes us to a number of significant
risks, including:
·
reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;
·
lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply;
·
reliance on these manufacturers to maintain competitive manufacturing technologies;
·
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws and tariffs;
·
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
·
differing labor regulations;
·
disruptions to the business, financial stability or operations, including due to strikes, labor disputes or other disruptions to the workforce, of these manufacturers;
·
compliance with a wide variety of complex regulatory requirements;
·
fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
·
changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;
·
effects of terrorist attacks or geopolitical conflicts abroad;
·
greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations; and
·
increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities.
Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost
of our products from our contract manufacturers or suppliers could cause us to lose net revenue, damage our customer relationships and
harm our reputation in the marketplace, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations.
From time to time, we may transition the manufacturing of certain products
from one contract manufacturer to another. When we do this, we may incur substantial expenses, risk material delays or encounter other
unexpected issues.
35
Certain of our products are sold into mature markets, which could
limit our ability to continue to generate revenue from these products. Our ability to sustain and grow our business depends on our ability
to develop, market, and sell new products.
Certain of our products are sold into mature markets that are characterized
by a trend of declining demand. As the overall market for these products decreases due to the adoption of new technologies, we expect
that our revenues from these products will continue to decline. As a result, our future prospects will depend on our ability to develop
and successfully market new products that address new and growing markets. Our failure to develop new products or failure to achieve widespread
customer acceptance of any new products could cause us to lose market share and cause our revenues to decline. There can be no assurance
that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, marketing and sale of new
products or product enhancements. Factors that could cause delays include regulatory and/or industry approvals, product design cycle and
failure to identify products or features that customers demand. In addition, the introduction and sale of new products often involves
a significant technical evaluation, and we often face delays because of our customers’ internal procedures for evaluating, approving
and deploying new technologies. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with new products is typically lengthy, often
lasting six to 24 months and sometimes longer. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our introduction or announcement of new product
offerings will achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market acceptance or result in increased revenue in the near term.
Our software offerings are subject to risks that differ from
those facing our hardware products.
We continue to dedicate significant engineering resources to our management
software platform, applications, and SaaS offerings, including ConsoleFlow™. These product and service offerings are subject to
significant additional risks that are not necessarily related to our hardware products. Our ability to succeed with these offerings will
depend in large part on our ability to provide customers with software products and services that offer features and functionality that
address the specific needs of businesses. We may face challenges and delays in the development of this product line as the marketplace
for products and services evolves to meet the needs and desires of customers. We cannot provide assurances that we will be successful
in operating and growing this product line.
In light of these risks and uncertainties, we may not be able to establish
or maintain market share for our software and SaaS offerings. As we develop new product lines, we must adapt to market conditions that
are unfamiliar to us, such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past. We have and
will encounter competition from other solutions providers, many of whom may have more significant resources than us with which to compete.
There can be no assurance that we will recover our investments in this product line, that we will receive meaningful revenue from or realize
a profit from this new product line.
We may experience significant fluctuation in our revenue because
the timing of large orders placed by some of our customers is often project-based.
Our operating results fluctuate because we often receive large orders
from customers that coincide with the timing of the customer’s project. Sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers
delay approval or commencement of projects due to budgetary constraints, internal acceptance review procedures, timing of budget cycles
or timing of competitive evaluation processes. In addition, sometimes our customers make significant one-time hardware purchases for projects
which are not repeated. We sell primarily on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to long-term contracts, and we expect fluctuations
in our revenues as a result of one-time project-based purchases to continue in the future. In addition, our sales may be subject to significant
fluctuations based on the acceleration, delay or cancellation of customer projects, or our failure to complete one or a series of significant
potential sales. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, even a single order can have a disproportionate effect
on our quarterly revenues and operating results. As a result of the factors discussed above, and due to the complexities of the industry
in which we operate, it is difficult for us to forecast demand for our current or future products with any degree of certainty, which
means it is difficult for us to forecast our sales. If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors
or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.
36
The lengthy sales cycle for our products and services, along
with delays in customer completion of projects, make the timing of our revenues difficult to predict.
We have a lengthy sales cycle for many of our products that generally
extends between six and 24 months and sometimes longer due to a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process. The length of this process
can be affected by factors over which we have little or no control, including the customer’s budgetary constraints, timing of the
customer’s budget cycles, and concerns by the customer about the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors. As a
result, sales cycles for customer orders vary substantially among different customers. The lengthy sales cycle is one of the factors that
has caused, and may continue to cause, our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition,
we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not
result in agreements or revenues, which may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities. Accordingly, excessive delays in sales could
be material and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The nature of our products, customer base and sales channels
causes us to lack visibility into future demand for our products, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our manufacturing and inventory
requirements.
We use forecasts based on anticipated product orders to manage our
manufacturing and inventory levels and other aspects of our business. However, several factors contribute to a lack of visibility with
respect to future orders, including:
·
the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our products that can extend from six to 24 months or longer;
·
the project-driven nature of many of our customers’ requirements;
·
we primarily sell our products indirectly through distributors;
·
the uncertainty of the extent and timing of market acceptance of our new products;
·
the need to obtain industry certifications or regulatory approval for our products;
·
the lack of long-term contracts with our customers;
·
the diversity of our product lines and geographic scope of our product distribution;
·
we have some customers who make single, non-recurring purchases; and
·
a large number of our customers typically purchase in small quantities.
This lack of visibility impacts our ability to forecast our inventory
requirements. If we overestimate our customers’ future requirements for products, we may have excess inventory, which would increase
our costs and potentially require us to write-off inventory that becomes obsolete. Additionally, if we underestimate our customers’
future requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers, harm
our reputation, and cause our revenues to decline. If any of these events occur, they could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability
and the value of our common stock may decline.
Delays in qualifying revisions of existing products for certain
of our customers could result in the delay or loss of sales to those customers, which could negatively impact our business and financial
results.
Our industry is characterized by intense competition, rapidly evolving
technology and continually changing customer preferences and requirements. As a result, we frequently develop and introduce new versions
of our existing products, which we refer to as revisions.
37
Prior to purchasing our products, some of our customers require that
products undergo a qualification process, which may involve testing of the products in the customer’s system. A subsequent revision
to a product’s hardware or firmware, changes in the manufacturing process or our selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification
process, which may result in delays in sales to customers, loss of sales, or us holding excess or obsolete inventory.
After products are qualified, it can take additional time before the
customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying
any new or revised products with a customer, that failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of these products to the customer, and
could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, new revisions to our products could cause our customers to alter the timing
of their purchases, by either accelerating or delaying purchases, which could result in fluctuations of our net revenue from quarter to
quarter.
We depend on distributors for a majority of our sales and to
complete order fulfillment.
We depend on the resale of products through distributor accounts for
a substantial majority of our worldwide net revenue. In addition, sales through our top five distributors accounted for approximately
44% of our net revenue in fiscal 2022. A significant reduction of effort by one or more distributors to sell our products or a material
change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability
to sell our products. Furthermore, if a key distributor materially defaults on a contract or otherwise fails to perform, our business
and financial results would suffer.
In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing
relationships with them are important to our success. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these distributors impairs
their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors.
Our ability to sustain and grow our business depends in part
on the success of our distributors and resellers.
A substantial part of our revenues is generated through sales by distributors
and resellers. To the extent they are unsuccessful in selling our products, or if we are unable to obtain and retain a sufficient number
of high-quality distributors and resellers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our distributors
and resellers may devote more resources to marketing, selling and supporting products and services that are competitive with ours, than
to our products. They also may have incentives to promote our competitors' products over our products, particularly for our competitors
with larger volumes of orders, more diverse product offerings and a longer relationship with our distributors and resellers. In these
cases, one or more of our important distributors or resellers may stop selling our products completely or may significantly decrease the
volume of products they sell on our behalf. This sales structure also could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational
harm if, for example, any of our distributors or resellers misrepresents the functionality of our products or services to customers, violates
laws or our corporate policies. If we fail to effectively manage our existing or future distributors and resellers effectively, our business
and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
Changes to the average selling prices of our products could affect
our net revenue and gross margins and adversely affect results of operations.
In the past, we have experienced reductions in the average selling
prices and gross margins of our products. We expect competition to continue to increase, and we anticipate this could result in additional
downward pressure on our pricing. Our average selling prices for our products might also decline as a result of other reasons, including
promotional programs introduced by us or our competitors and customers who negotiate price concessions. To the extent we are able to increase
prices, we may experience a decline in sales volumes if customers decide to purchase competitive products. If any of these were to occur,
our gross margins could decline and we might not be able to reduce the cost to manufacture our products enough or at all to keep up with
the decline in prices.
If we are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, it
could become obsolete, which could require us to write-down or write off obsolete inventory, which could harm our operating results.
At any time, competitive products may be introduced with more attractive
features or at lower prices than ours. If this occurs, and for other reasons, we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our
products and our inventory levels may increase. There is a risk that we may be unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner to avoid
it becoming obsolete. If we are required to substantially discount our inventory or are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner,
we would be required to increase our inventory reserves or write off obsolete inventory and our operating results could be substantially
harmed.
38
Our failure to compete successfully in our highly competitive
market could result in reduced prices and loss of market share.
The market in which we operate is intensely competitive, subject to
rapid technological advances and highly sensitive to evolving industry standards. The market can also be affected significantly by new
product and technology introductions and marketing and pricing activities of industry participants. Our products compete directly with
products produced by a number of our competitors. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial and human resources
for marketing and product development, more experience conducting research and development activities, greater experience obtaining regulatory
approval for new products, larger distribution and customer networks, more established relationships with contract manufacturers and suppliers,
and more established reputations and name recognition. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against
our current or potential future competitors. In addition, the amount of competition we face in the marketplace may change and grow as
the market for IoT and M2M networking solutions grows and new companies enter the marketplace. Present and future competitors may be able
to identify new markets, adapt new technologies, develop and commercialize products more quickly and gain market acceptance of products
with greater success. As a result of these competitive factors, we may fail to meet our business objectives and our business, financial
condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
Acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or investments
may impair our capital and equity resources, divert our management’s attention or otherwise negatively impact our operating results.
We may pursue acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures
that we believe would allow us to complement our growth strategy, increase market share in our current markets and expand into adjacent
markets, broaden our technology and intellectual property and strengthen our relationships with distributors, OEMs and ODMs. For instance,
we acquired Maestro, Intrinsyc, the Transition Networks and Net2Edge businesses of CSI, and Uplogix in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively.
Our previous acquisitions have required, and any future acquisition, partnership, joint venture or investment may also require, that we
pay significant cash, issue equity and/or incur substantial debt. Acquisitions, partnerships or joint ventures may also result in the
loss of key personnel and the dilution of existing stockholders to the extent we are required to issue equity securities. In addition,
acquisitions, partnerships or joint ventures require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from our other operations.
These capital, equity and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our business. Furthermore, acquired businesses may not be
effectively integrated, may be unable to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships, may not result in expected synergies, an
increase in revenues or earnings or the delivery of new products, may contribute to increased fixed costs, and may expose us to unanticipated
liabilities. If any of these occur, we may fail to meet our business objectives and our business, financial condition and operating results
could be materially and adversely affected.
We may experience difficulties associated with utilizing third-party
logistics providers.
A majority of our physical inventory management process, as well as
the shipping and receiving of our inventory, is performed by third-party logistics providers in Los Angeles, California and Hong Kong.
There is a possibility that these third-party logistics providers will not perform as expected and we could experience delays in our ability
to ship, receive, and process the related data in a timely manner. This could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations,
cash flows and the market price of our common stock.
Relying on third-party logistics providers could increase the risk
of the following: failing to receive accurate and timely inventory data, theft or poor physical security of our inventory, inventory damage,
ineffective internal controls over inventory processes or other similar business risks out of our immediate control.
39
Risks Related to Technology, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property
Cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise
our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.
In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive
data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners,
and personally identifiable information of our employees, on our networks and third-party cloud software providers. Increased global information
technology (“IT”) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems
and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. There have been several recent, highly publicized cases
in which organizations of various types and sizes have reported the unauthorized disclosure of customer or other confidential information,
as well as cyberattacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information, intellectual property, cash or other
valuable assets. There have also been several highly publicized cases in which hackers have requested “ransom” payments in
exchange for not disclosing customer or other confidential information or for not disabling the target company’s computer or other
systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of the information that we collect and store on our systems is critical to
our operations and implementing security measures designed to prevent, detect, mitigate or correct these or other IT security threats
involves significant costs. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems, we have, from time to time,
experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware, phishing and computer virus attacks, and it is possible that in the future
our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure
of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. In addition, due to the fast pace and unpredictability of
cyber threats, long-term implementation plans designed to address cybersecurity risks become obsolete quickly and, in some cases, it may
be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. Any unauthorized access, disclosure or other
loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence
in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.
If our products become subject to cybersecurity breaches, or
if public perception is that they are vulnerable to cyberattacks, our reputation and business could suffer.
We could be subject to liability or our reputation could be harmed
if technologies integrated into our products, or our products, fail to prevent cyberattacks, or if our partners or customers fail to safeguard
the systems with security policies that conform to industry best practices. In addition, any cyberattack or security breach that affects
a competitor’s products could lead to the negative perception that our solutions are or could be subject to similar attacks or breaches.
Some of our software offerings may be subject to various cybersecurity
risks, which are particularly acute in the cloud-based technologies operated by us and other third parties that form a part of our solutions.
In connection with certain implementations of our management software
platform, application, and SaaS offering, ConsoleFlow, we expect to store, convey and process data produced by devices. This data may
include confidential or proprietary information, intellectual property or personally identifiable information of our customers or other
third parties with whom they do business. It is important for us to maintain solutions and related infrastructure that are perceived by
our customers and other parties with whom we do business to provide a reasonable level of reliability and security. Despite available
security measures and other precautions, the infrastructure and transmission methods used by our products and services may be vulnerable
to interception, attack or other disruptive problems.
If a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized
access to or modification of our customers’ data or our own data, whether due to a failure with our systems or related systems operated
by third parties, we could suffer damage to our brand and reputation. The costs we would incur to address and fix these incidents could
significantly increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and increased
legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring. Further, as regulatory
focus on privacy and data security issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the protection of information
become more complex, the potential risks and costs of compliance to our business will intensify.
40
If software that we incorporate into our products were to become
unavailable or no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, it could adversely affect sales of our products, which could disrupt
our business and harm our financial results.
Certain of our products contain software developed and maintained by
third-party software vendors or which are available through the “open source” software community. We also expect that we may
incorporate software from third-party vendors and open source software in our future products. Our business would be disrupted if this
software, or functional equivalents of this software, were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially
reasonable terms. In either case, we would be required to either redesign our products to function with alternate third-party software
or open source software, or develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our
product shipments. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings.
Our products may contain undetected software or hardware errors
or defects that could lead to an increase in our costs, reduce our net revenue or damage our reputation.
We currently offer warranties ranging from one to five years on each
of our products. Our products could contain undetected software or hardware errors or defects. If there is a product failure, we might
have to replace all affected products, or we might have to refund the purchase price for the units. Regardless of the amount of testing
we undertake, some errors might be discovered only after a product has been installed and used by customers. Any errors discovered after
commercial release could result in financial losses and claims against us. Significant product warranty claims against us could harm our
business, reputation and financial results and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual
property rights, which could harm our competitive position or require us to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.
We rely primarily on a combination of laws, such as patent, copyright,
trademark and trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect
our proprietary rights. Despite any precautions that we have taken:
·
laws and contractual restrictions might not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies;
·
other companies might claim intellectual property rights based upon prior use that negatively impacts our ability to enforce our trademarks and patents; and
·
policing unauthorized use of our patented technology and trademarks is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and we might be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use.
Also, the laws of some of the countries in which we market and manufacture
our products offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other
misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it. Consequently,
we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited by others in the U.S. or abroad, which could require costly
efforts to protect our technology. Policing the unauthorized use of our technology, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive,
difficult and, in some cases, impracticable. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property
rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could
result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business. Accordingly, despite our efforts,
we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, which may harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
The impact of natural disasters and other business interruptions
could negatively impact our supply chain and customers resulting in an adverse impact to our revenues and profitability.
Certain of our components and other materials used in producing our
products are from regions susceptible to natural disasters. A natural disaster could damage equipment and inventory at our suppliers’
facilities, adversely affecting our supply chain. If we are unable to obtain these materials, we could experience a disruption to our
supply chain that would hinder our ability to produce our products in a timely manner, or cause us to seek other sources of supply, which
may be more costly or which we may not be able to procure on a timely basis. In addition, our customers may not follow their normal purchasing
patterns or temporarily cease purchasing from us due to impacts to their businesses in the region, creating unexpected fluctuations or
decreases in our revenues and profitability. Natural disasters in other parts of the world on which our operations are reliant also could
have material adverse impacts on our business.
41
In addition, our operations and those of our suppliers are vulnerable
to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity breaches, IT systems failure, terrorist attacks
and other events beyond our control. A substantial portion of our facilities, including our corporate headquarters and other critical
business operations, are located near major earthquake faults and, therefore, may be more susceptible to damage if an earthquake occurs.
We do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses. If a business interruption occurs, whether due to a natural
disaster or otherwise, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
Risk Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have a history of losses.
We have historically incurred net losses. There can be no assurance
that we will generate net profits in future periods. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be cash flow positive in future
periods. In the event that we fail to achieve profitability in future periods, the value of our common stock may decline. In
addition, if we are unable to achieve or maintain positive cash flows, we would be required to seek additional funding, which may not
be available on favorable terms, if at all.
We may need additional capital and it may not be available on
acceptable terms, or at all.
To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments
to operate our business and develop our products. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and
amount of our net revenue, research and development expenditures, expenses associated with any strategic partnerships or acquisitions
and infrastructure investments, and expenses related to litigation, each of which could negatively affect our ability to generate additional
cash from operations. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may need to raise
additional capital. Looking ahead at long-term needs, we may need to raise additional funds for a number of purposes, including, but not
limited to:
·
to fund working capital requirements;
·
to update, enhance or expand the range of products we offer;
·
to refinance existing indebtedness;
·
to increase our sales and marketing activities; or
·
to respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities, such as investment, acquisition and international expansion activities.
·
to acquire additional businesses
We may seek additional capital from public or private offerings of
our capital stock, borrowings under our existing or future credit lines or other sources. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise
additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences
and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, licensing,
joint ventures, or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential future products or proprietary
technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any needed
capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to secure additional financing in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms,
we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities, respond to competition or continue to operate
our business.
The terms of our Senior Credit Facilities may restrict our financial
and operational flexibility and, in certain cases, our ability to operate.
The terms of our Senior Credit Facilities restrict, among other things,
our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, dispose of assets, make investments, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate
and enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements. Further, we are currently and may in the future be required to maintain specified
financial ratios, including pursuant to a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or a minimum liquidity test. Our
ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will
meet those tests. Pursuant to our amended credit agreement and the related loan and security agreement, we have pledged substantially
all of our assets to our senior lender, SVB.

Risks Related to International Operations
Rising concern regarding international tariffs could materially
and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The current political landscape has introduced significant uncertainty
with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements, as shown by the U.S.-initiated renegotiation of
the North America Free Trade Agreement, Brexit in Europe, and the current war between Ukraine and Russia. This uncertainty includes the
possibility of imposing tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the U.S., including the US government’s institution
of a 25% tariff on a range of products from China and subsequent tariffs imposed by the U.S. as well as tariffs imposed by trading partners
on U.S. goods, the potential for increased trade barriers between the U.K. and the European Union, and export controls or other retaliatory
actions against, or restrictions on doing business with Russia, as well as any resulting disruption, instability or volatility in the
global markets and industries resulting from such conflict. The institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China
specifically, carries the risk of negatively affecting the overall economic conditions of both China and the U.S., which could have a
negative impact on us.
We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes
to international trade agreements or whether quotas, duties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions on our products will be
changed or imposed. If we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of regulatory
changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Furthermore, imposition of tariffs may result in local sourcing initiatives, or other developments
that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries, which would negatively impact our business and operating results.
We face risks associated with our international operations that
could impair our ability to grow our revenues abroad as well as our overall financial condition.
We believe that our future growth is dependent in part upon our ability
to increase sales in international markets. These sales are subject to a variety of risks, including geopolitical events, fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, longer
accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and export license requirements. In addition, we are subject
to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic
and trade relationships. In many markets where we operate, business and cultural norms are different than those in the U.S., and practices
that may violate laws and regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) unfortunately
are more commonplace. Although we have implemented policies and procedures with the intention of ensuring compliance with these laws and
regulations, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as distributors and resellers involved in our international sales, may take
actions in violation of our policies. Many of our vendors and strategic business allies also have international operations and are subject
to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely
affected if one or more of our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks. There can be no assurance that one or
more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and financial condition.
Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.
We are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currencies
and interest rates. In particular, we are exposed to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which our products
are sold and our services are purchased, including devaluation and revaluation of local currencies. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign
currency rates could adversely affect our revenues.
In particular, the uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain
European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related European financial restructuring efforts may
cause the value of the Euro and other European currencies to fluctuate. If the value of European currencies, including the Euro, deteriorates,
thus reducing the purchasing power of European customers, our sales could be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters
Our inability to obtain appropriate industry certifications or
approvals from governmental regulatory bodies could impede our ability to grow revenues in our wireless products.
The sale of our wireless products in some geographical markets
is sometimes dependent on the ability to gain certifications and/or approvals by relevant governmental bodies. In addition, many of our
products are certified as meeting various industry quality and/or compatibility standards.  Failure to obtain these certifications
or approvals, or delays in receiving any needed certifications or approvals, could impact our ability to compete effectively or at all
in these markets and could have an adverse impact on our revenues.
43
Our failure to comply effectively with regulatory laws pertaining
to our foreign operations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.
We are required to comply with U.S. government export regulations in
the sale of our products to foreign customers, including requirements to properly classify and screen our products against a denied parties
list prior to shipment. We are also required to comply with the provisions of the FCPA and all other anti-corruption laws, such as the
U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, of all other countries in which we do business, directly or indirectly, including compliance with the anti-bribery
prohibitions and the accounting and recordkeeping requirements of these laws. Violations of the FCPA or other similar laws could trigger
sanctions, including ineligibility for U.S. government insurance and financing, as well as large fines. Failure to comply with the aforementioned
regulations could also affect our decision to sell our products in international jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect
on our revenues and profitability.
Our failure to comply effectively with the requirements of applicable
environmental legislation and regulation could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.
Certain states and countries have passed regulations relating to chemical
substances in electronic products and requiring electronic products to use environmentally friendly components. For example, the European
Union has the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, the Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive, and the Regulation
on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. In the future, China and other countries including the U.S. are
expected to adopt further environmental compliance programs. In order to comply with these regulations, we may need to redesign our products
to use different components, which may be more expensive, if they are available at all. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we
may not be able to sell our products in jurisdictions where these regulations apply, which could have a material adverse effect on our
revenues and profitability.
Increasing attention on environmental, social and governance
matters may have a negative impact on our business, impose additional costs on us, and expose us to additional risks.
Increasingly regulators (including the
SEC), customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. While
we have, or are developing, certain ESG initiatives, there can be no assurance that regulators, customers, investors, and employees will
determine that these programs are sufficiently robust. Actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to our ESG initiatives and reporting
can impact our ability to hire and retain employees, increase our customer base, or attract and retain certain types of investors. In
addition, these parties are increasingly focused on specific disclosures and frameworks related to ESG matters. Collecting, measuring,
and reporting ESG information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming, is subject to evolving reporting standards, and
can present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material impact on us, including
on our reputation and stock price. Inadequate processes to collect and review this information prior to disclosure could subject us to
potential liability related to such information.
Current or future litigation could adversely affect us.
We are subject to a wide range of claims and lawsuits in the course
of our business. Any lawsuit may involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and the
diversion of other resources. The results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes are possible.
In particular, litigation regarding intellectual property rights occurs
frequently in our industry. The results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes are possible. Adverse outcomes may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
There is a risk that other third parties could claim that our products,
or our customers’ products, infringe on their intellectual property rights or that we have misappropriated their intellectual property.
In addition, software, business processes and other property rights in our industry might be increasingly subject to third-party infringement
claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Other parties might
currently have, or might eventually be issued, patents that pertain to the proprietary rights we use. Any of these third parties might
make a claim of infringement against us. The results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes are possible.
44
Responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, could:
·
be time-consuming, costly and/or result in litigation;
·
divert management’s time and attention from developing our business;
·
require us to pay monetary damages, including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed;
·
require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;
·
require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; or
·
require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.
If any of these occur, our business, financial condition or results
of operations could be adversely affected.
General Risk Factors
Risks generally associated with a company-wide implementation
of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of our
internal controls over financial reporting.
In October 2022 we implemented a company-wide ERP system to
upgrade certain existing business, operational, and financial processes, and continue to refine the system on an ongoing basis. Our ERP
implementation is a complex and time-consuming project. This project has required and may continue to require investment of capital and
human resources, the re-engineering of processes of our business, and the attention of many employees who would otherwise be focused on
other aspects of our business. Any deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system could result in higher
costs than we had anticipated and could adversely affect our ability to develop and launch solutions, provide services, fulfill contractual
obligations, file reports with the SEC in a timely manner, operate our business or otherwise affect our controls environment. Any of these
consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, because the ERP is a new
system that we have limited prior experience with, there is an increased risk that one or more of our financial controls may fail. Any
failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. If our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we have a material weakness
in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock
Market, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting,
or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the
capital markets.
If we are unable to attract, retain or motivate key senior management
and technical personnel, it could seriously harm our business.
Our financial performance depends substantially on the performance
of our executive officers and of key engineers, marketing and sales employees. We are particularly dependent upon our technical personnel,
due to the specialized technical nature of our business. If we were to lose the services of our executive officers or any of our key personnel
and were not able to find replacements in a timely manner, our business could be disrupted, other key personnel might decide to leave,
and we might incur increased operating expenses associated with finding and compensating replacements.
Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause
the market price of our common stock to decline.
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant
fluctuations in net revenue, expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter. We therefore believe that quarter to quarter comparisons
of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance, and you should not rely on them to predict our future operating
or financial performance or the future performance of the market price of our common stock. A high percentage of our operating expenses
are relatively fixed and are based on our forecast of future revenue. If we were to experience an unexpected reduction in net revenue
in a quarter, we would likely be unable to adjust our short-term expenditures significantly. If this were to occur, our operating results
for that fiscal quarter would be harmed. In addition, if our operating results in future fiscal quarters were to fall below the expectations
of equity analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock would likely fall.
45
The market price of our common stock may be volatile based on
a number of factors, many of which are not under our control.
The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile. The
market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are out of our
control, including:
·
adverse changes in domestic or global economic, market and other conditions;
·
new products or services offered by our competitors;
·
our completion of or failure to complete significant one-time sales of our products;
·
actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;
·
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;
·
announcements of technological innovations;
·
our announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
·
conditions or trends in the industry;
·
additions or departures of key personnel;
·
increased competition from industry consolidation;
·
mergers and acquisitions; and
·
sales of common stock by our stockholders or us or repurchases of common stock by us.
In addition, the Nasdaq Capital Market often experiences price and
volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies listed
on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
