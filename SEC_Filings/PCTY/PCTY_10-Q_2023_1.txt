share data) (1) Organization and Description of Business   Paylocity Holding Corporation (the “Company”) is a cloud-based provider of human capital management and payroll software solutions that deliver a comprehensive platform for the modern workforce. Services are provided in a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) delivery model. The Company’s comprehensive product suite delivers a unified platform that helps businesses attract and retain talent, build culture and connection with their employees, and streamline and automate HR and payroll processes.
(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a)
Basis of Presentation, Consolidation and Use of Estimates These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. Accounting estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes. (b)
Interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Information   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year or the results for any future periods. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(c)
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, using the asset and liability method. The Company’s provision for income taxes is based on the annual effective rate method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net-recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 6 Table of Contents (d)
Recently Issued Accounting Standards   From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of other recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
(3) Revenue The Company derives its revenue from contracts predominantly from recurring and non-recurring service fees. While the majority of its agreements are generally cancellable by the client on
60
days’ notice or less, the Company also offers term agreements to its clients, which are generally
two years
in length. Recurring fees are derived from payroll, timekeeping, and HR-related cloud-based computing services. The majority of the Company’s recurring fees are satisfied over time as services are provided. The performance obligations related to payroll services are satisfied upon the processing of the client’s payroll with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per payroll frequency fee. The performance obligations related to time and attendance services and HR related services are satisfied over time each month with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per month fee. For subscription-based fees which can include payroll, time and attendance, and other HCM related services, the Company recognizes the applicable recurring fees over time each month with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per month fee. Non-recurring service fees consist mainly of nonrefundable implementation fees, which involve setting the client up in, and loading data into, the Company’s cloud-based modules. These implementation activities are considered set-up activities. The Company has determined that the nonrefundable upfront fees provide certain clients with a material right to renew the contract.
Disaggregation of revenue The following table disaggregates total revenues from contracts by Recurring fees and Implementation services and other, which the Company believes depicts the nature, amount and timing of its revenue: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Recurring fees $ 188,159   $ 247,522   $ 362,856   $ 484,341   Implementation services and other 6,882   8,912   13,009   17,499   Total revenues from contracts $ 195,041   $ 256,434   $ 375,865   $ 501,840   Deferred revenue The timing of revenue recognition for recurring revenue is consistent with the timing of invoicing as they occur simultaneously based on the client payroll processing period or by month. As such, the Company does not recognize contract assets or liabilities related to recurring revenue. The Company defers and amortizes nonrefundable upfront fees related to implementation services generally over a period up to
24
months based on the type of contract.
The following table summarizes the changes in deferred revenue (i.e., contract liability) related to these nonrefundable upfront fees as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Balance at beginning of the period $ 8,717 $ 14,195 $ 8,734 $ 12,233 Deferral of revenue 5,407 12,002 9,760 20,234 Revenue recognized ( 4,783 ) ( 6,460 ) ( 9,153 ) ( 12,730 ) Balance at end of the period $ 9,341 $ 19,737 $ 9,341 $ 19,737 Deferred revenue related to these nonrefundable upfront fees are recorded within Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company expects to recognize these deferred revenue balances of $ 12,680
in fiscal 2023, $ 6,102
in fiscal 2024 and $ 955
in fiscal 2025 and thereafter.
7 Table of Contents Deferred contract costs The Company defers certain selling and commission costs that meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. The Company also capitalizes certain costs to fulfill a contract related to its proprietary products if they are identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered under ASC 340-40. Implementation fees are treated as nonrefundable upfront fees and the related implementation costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit, which is the period in which the Company expects to recover the costs and enhance its ability to satisfy future performance obligations.
The Company utilizes the portfolio approach to account for both the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a contract. These capitalized costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which has been determined to be over
7
years based on the Company’s average client life and other qualitative factors, including rate of technological changes. The Company does not incur any additional costs to obtain or fulfill contracts upon renewal. The Company recognizes additional selling and commission costs and fulfillment costs when an existing client purchases additional services. These additional costs only relate to the additional services purchased and do not relate to the renewal of previous services.
The following tables present the deferred contract costs and the related amortization expense for these deferred contract costs: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Beginning Balance Capitalized Costs Amortization Ending Balance Costs to obtain a new contract $ 149,222   $ 14,929   $ ( 8,587 ) $ 155,564   Costs to fulfill a contract 76,785   13,100   ( 3,770 ) 86,115   Total $ 226,007   $ 28,029   $ ( 12,357 ) $ 241,679   Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Beginning Balance Capitalized Costs Amortization Ending Balance Costs to obtain a new contract $ 191,088   $ 20,310   $ ( 10,845 ) $ 200,553   Costs to fulfill a contract 117,524   18,803   ( 6,010 ) 130,317   Total $ 308,612   $ 39,113   $ ( 16,855 ) $ 330,870   Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 Beginning Balance Capitalized Costs Amortization Ending Balance Costs to obtain a new contract $ 145,718   $ 26,666   $ ( 16,820 ) $ 155,564   Costs to fulfill a contract 69,175   24,040   ( 7,100 ) 86,115   Total $ 214,893   $ 50,706   $ ( 23,920 ) $ 241,679   Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Beginning Balance Capitalized Costs Amortization Ending Balance Costs to obtain a new contract $ 182,543   $ 39,222   $ ( 21,212 ) $ 200,553   Costs to fulfill a contract 106,025   35,665   ( 11,373 ) 130,317   Total $ 288,568   $ 74,887   $ ( 32,585 ) $ 330,870   Deferred contract costs are recorded within Deferred contract costs and Long-term deferred contract costs on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs is primarily recorded in Cost of revenues and Sales and marketing in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
Remaining Performance Obligations The balance of the Company’s remaining performance obligations related to minimum monthly fees on its term-based contracts was approximately $ 53,940
as of December 31, 2022, which will be generally recognized over the next
24
8 Table of Contents months. This balance excludes the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts for which the variable consideration is allocated entirely to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations. ( 4) Business Combinations On January 18, 2022, the Company acquired all of the shares outstanding of Cloudsnap, Inc., ("Cloudsnap") through a merger for cash consideration of $ 50,002 , which was paid upon closing. Cloudsnap is a provider of a flexible, low-code solution for integrating disparate business applications.

The Company regularly reviews the composition of its portfolio to determine the existence of credit impairment. The Company did
not
recognize any credit impairment losses during the three or six months ended December 31, 2021 or 2022. All securities in the Company’s portfolio held an A-1 rating or better as of December 31, 2022. The Company did not make any material reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income for realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities during the three or six months ended December 31, 2021 or 2022. There were
no
realized gains or losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities for the three or six months ended December 31, 2021 or 2022. Expected maturities of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2022 were as follows: Amortized cost Fair value One year or less $ 259,823 $ 258,853 One year to two years 90,033 87,491 Two years to three years 93,175 91,459 Three years to five years 2,000 1,780 Total available-for-sale securities $ 445,031 $ 439,583 (7) Fair Value Measurement Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: • Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. • Level 2—Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. The Company measures certain cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and client fund obligations at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. The Company considers the recorded value of these
13 Table of Contents financial assets and liabilities to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 based upon the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Marketable securities, consisting of securities classified as available-for-sale as well as certain cash equivalents, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. Available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. government agency and other securities. The independent pricing service utilizes a variety of inputs including benchmark yields, broker/dealer quoted prices, reported trades, issuer spreads as well as other available market data. The Company, on a sample basis, validates the pricing from the independent pricing service against another third-party pricing source for reasonableness. The Company has not adjusted any prices obtained by the independent pricing service, as it believes they are appropriately valued. There were
no
available-for-sale securities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at June 30, 2022 or December 31, 2022.
The fair value level for the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities was as follows: June 30, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Cash and cash equivalents $ 139,756 $ 139,756 $ — $ — Funds held for clients' cash and cash equivalents 3,653,697 3,640,427 13,270 — Available-for-sale securities: Commercial paper 58,040 — 58,040 — Corporate bonds 57,853 — 57,853 — Asset-backed securities 9,704 — 9,704 — Certificates of deposit 31,836 — 31,836 — U.S. treasury securities 166,987 — 166,987 — U.S government agency securities 7,549 — 7,549 — Other 2,110 — 2,110 — Total available-for-sale securities 334,079 — 334,079 — Total investments $ 4,127,532 $ 3,780,183 $ 347,349 $ — December 31, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Cash and cash equivalents $ 120,053 $ 120,053 $ — $ — Funds held for clients' cash and cash equivalents 2,626,114 2,607,468 18,646 — Available-for-sale securities: Commercial paper 97,423 — 97,423 — Corporate bonds 76,777 — 76,777 — Asset-backed securities 27,668 — 27,668 — Certificates of deposit 40,462 — 40,462 — U.S. treasury securities 185,250 — 185,250 — U.S government agency securities 7,399 — 7,399 — Other 4,604 — 4,604 — Total available-for-sale securities 439,583 — 439,583 — Total investments $ 3,185,750 $ 2,727,521 $ 458,229 $ — Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

14 Table of Contents (8) Debt In July 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, and other lenders, which is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets, subject to certain restrictions. In August 2022, the Company entered into a first amendment to the aforementioned credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility ("credit facility") to $ 550,000 , which may be increased up to $ 825,000 , subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying other requirements. The amended credit agreement extends the maturity date of the credit facility to August 2027 and replaces the interest rate based on London Interbank Offered Rate with an interest rate based on secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR"). The Company had
no
borrowings at June 30, 2022 or December 31, 2022. The proceeds of any borrowings are to be used to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions, permitted investments, permitted distributions and share repurchases. The Company may generally borrow, prepay and reborrow under the credit facility and terminate or reduce the lenders’ commitments at any time prior to revolving credit facility expiration without a premium or a penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs.
Any borrowings under the credit facility will generally bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate per annum determined by reference to either the Term SOFR rate plus the SOFR Adjustment or an adjusted base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from
0.875 % to
1.500 % and
0.0 % to
0.500 %, respectively, based on the then-applicable net total leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company is required to pay certain commitment, letter of credit fronting and letter of credit participation fees on available and/or undrawn portions of the credit facility. The Company is required to comply with certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a requirement to maintain a maximum net total leverage ratio of not greater than
4.00
to 1.00, (with a step up to
4.50
to 1.00 for the 4 consecutive fiscal quarters following a fiscal quarter in which certain permitted acquisitions are consummated), and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than
2.00
to 1.00. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of the aforementioned covenants. (9) Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains a 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2008 Plan”) and a 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) pursuant to which the Company has reserved shares of its common stock for issuance to its employees, directors and non-employee third parties. The 2014 Plan serves as the successor to the 2008 Plan and permits the granting of restricted stock units and other equity incentives at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors.
No
new awards have been or will be issued under the 2008 Plan since the effective date of the 2014 Plan. Outstanding awards under the 2008 Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2008 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan may increase each calendar year, continuing through and including January 1, 2024. The number of shares added each year may be equal to the lesser of (a) four and five tenths percent ( 4.5 %) of the number of shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or (b) an amount determined by the Company’s board of directors. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
13,784
shares allocated to the plans, of which
1,841
shares were subject to outstanding options or awards. Generally, the Company issues previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options or vesting of awards; however, shares previously subject to 2014 Plan grants or awards that are forfeited or net settled at exercise or release may be reissued to satisfy future issuances. 15 Table of Contents The following table summarizes changes in the number of shares available for grant under the Company’s equity incentive plans during the six months ended December 31, 2022: Number of Shares Available for grant at July 1, 2022 12,393   RSUs granted ( 730 ) MSUs granted ( 81 ) Shares withheld in settlement of taxes and/or exercise price 334   Forfeitures 95   Shares removed ( 68 ) Available for grant at December 31, 2022 11,943   Shares removed represents forfeitures of shares and shares withheld in settlement of taxes and/or payment of exercise price related to grants made under the 2008 Plan. As noted above,
no
new awards will be issued under the 2008 Plan. Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units (“RSUs”), market share units (“MSUs”) and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is included in the following line items in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Cost of revenues $ 3,317   $ 5,232   $ 5,924   $ 9,273   Sales and marketing 5,716   10,795   10,875   20,354   Research and development 5,406   11,292   9,108   20,094   General and administrative 11,804   16,232   19,895   33,643   Total stock-based compensation expense $ 26,243   $ 43,551   $ 45,802   $ 83,364   In addition, the Company capitalized $ 1,879

and $ 6,096
during the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. There were
no
stock options granted during the six months ended December 31, 2022.

and $ 1,484
during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and $ 47,627
and $ 49,627
during the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The Company grants RSUs under the 2014 Plan with terms determined at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors. RSUs generally vest over
four years
following the grant date and have time-based vesting conditions. 16 Table of Contents The following table represents restricted stock unit activity during the six months ended December 31, 2022: Units Weighted average grant date fair value RSU balance at July 1, 2022 1,327   $ 168.44   RSUs granted 730   $ 261.90   RSUs vested ( 609 ) $ 148.90   RSUs forfeited ( 92 ) $ 138.11   RSU balance at December 31, 2022 1,356   $ 228.70   At December 31, 2022, there was $ 173,117
of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested restricted stock units granted. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
1.9
years. The Company also grants MSUs under the 2014 Plan with terms determined at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors. The actual number of MSUs that will be eligible to vest is based on the achievement of a relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) target as compared to the TSR realized by each of the companies comprising the Russell 3000 Index over an approximately
three-year
period. The MSUs cliff-vest at the end of the TSR measurement period, and up to
200 % of the target number of shares subject to each MSU are eligible to be earned. The following table represents market share unit activity during the six months ended December 31, 2022: Units Weighted average grant date fair value MSU balance at July 1, 2022 101 $ 263.83 MSUs granted 81 $ 388.25 MSUs forfeited ( 3 ) $ 355.60 MSU balance at December 31, 2022 179 $ 318.97 The Company estimated the grant date fair value of the MSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model that included the following assumptions: Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Valuation assumptions: Expected dividend yield — % — % Expected volatility 47.4

of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested MSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a period of
2.4
years. (10) Litigation On November 16, 2020, a potential class action complaint was filed against the Company with the Circuit Court of Cook County alleging that the Company violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The complaint seeks statutory damages, attorney’s fees and other costs. The Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of loss, with respect to this matter at this time. The Company intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.
From time to time, the Company is subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Many of these matters are covered in whole or in part by insurance. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the ultimate disposition of any matters currently outstanding or threatened will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
17 Table of Contents financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and could materially impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity based on the final disposition of these matters. (11) Income Taxes The Company’s quarterly provision for income taxes is based on the annual effective rate method. The Company’s quarterly provision for income taxes also includes the tax impact of certain unusual or infrequently occurring items, if any, including changes in judgment about valuation allowances and effects of changes in tax laws or rates, and other discrete items in the interim period in which they occur. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the "IRA") was signed into law and contains a number of tax related provisions. The Company is in the process of evaluating the IRA but does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company’s effective tax rate was ( 26.9 )% and
14.3 % for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was lower than the federal statutory rate of
21 % primarily due to excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the federal statutory rate of
21 % primarily due to a decrease to the valuation allowance, partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). The Company's effective tax rate was ( 127.8 )% and ( 82.9 )% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was lower than the federal statutory rate of
21 % primarily due to excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation and state and local income taxes, partially offset by an increase to the valuation allowance. The Company's effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the federal statutory rate of
21 % primarily due to excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation, state and local income taxes, and a decrease in the valuation allowance. (12) Net Income Per Share Basic net income per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, the release of restricted stock units and market share units as of the balance sheet date.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The statements included herein that are not based solely on historical facts are “forward looking statements.” Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by us in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including items discussed below and impacts from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2022. Overview We are a leading cloud-based provider of human capital management, or HCM, and payroll software solutions that deliver a comprehensive platform for the modern workforce. Our HCM and payroll platform offers an intuitive, easy-to-use product suite that helps businesses attract and retain talent, build culture and connection with their employees, and streamline and automate HR and payroll processes. Effective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Our cloud-based software solutions, combined with our unified database architecture, are highly flexible and configurable and feature a modern, intuitive user experience. Our platform offers automated data integration with hundreds of third-party partner systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems. We plan to continue to invest in research and development efforts that will allow us to offer a broader selection of products to new and existing clients focused on experiences that solve our clients’ challenges. We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients and we intend to invest in our business to achieve this purpose. We market and sell our solutions through our direct sales force. We have increased our sales and marketing expenses as we have added sales representatives and related sales and marketing personnel. We intend to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization across new and existing geographic territories. In addition to growing our number of clients, we intend to grow our revenue over the long term by increasing the number of solutions that clients purchase from us. To do so, we must continue to enhance and grow the number of solutions we offer to advance our platform. We also believe that delivering a positive service experience is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain our clients. We supplement our comprehensive software solutions with an integrated implementation and client service organization, all of which are designed to meet the needs of our clients and prospects. We expect to continue to invest in and grow our implementation and client service organization as our client base grows. We will continue to invest across our entire organization as we continue to grow our business over the long term. These investments include increasing the number of personnel across all functional areas, along with improving our solutions and infrastructure to support our growth. The timing and amount of these investments vary based on the rate at which we add new clients and personnel and scale our application development and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them, which will make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. We expect these investments to increase our costs on an absolute basis, but as we grow our number of clients and our related revenues, we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale and increased operating leverage. As a result, we expect our gross and operating margins will improve over the long term. Paylocity Holding Corporation is a Delaware corporation, which was formed in November 2013. Our business operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Key Metrics We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Revenue Growth Our recurring revenue model and high annual revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results and cash flow from operations. This visibility enables us to better manage and invest in our business. Total revenues increased from $196.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $273.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing a 39% year-over-year increase. Total revenues increased from $377.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to $526.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022,
20 Table of Contents representing a 39% year-over-year increase. The increase in year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the strong performance by our sales team and also increases in client workforce levels and growth in interest income on funds held for clients attributable to rising interest rates and higher average daily balances for funds held for clients due to new clients and increases in client workforce levels as compared to the prior fiscal year. Our
revenue growth in future periods may be impacted by fluctuations in client employee counts, potential increases in client losses, a changing interest rate environment, uncertainties around market and economic conditions including inflation risk, among other factors. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA We disclose Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA because we use them to evaluate our performance, and we believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA assist in the comparison of our performance across reporting periods by excluding certain items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe these metrics are used in the financial community, and we present them to enhance investors’ understanding of our operating performance and cash flows. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and you should not consider Adjusted Gross Profit as an alternative to gross profit or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income or cash provided by operating activities, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definition of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA may be different than the definition utilized for similarly-titled measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, amortization of certain acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises, and other items as defined below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and other items as defined below.

Basis of Presentation Revenues Recurring and other revenue We derive the majority of our revenues from recurring fees attributable to our cloud-based HCM and payroll software solutions. Recurring fees for each client generally include a base fee in addition to a fee based on the number of client employees and the number of products a client uses. We also charge fees attributable to our preparation of W-2 documents and annual required filings on behalf of our clients. We charge implementation fees for professional services provided to implement our HCM and payroll solutions. Implementations of our payroll solutions typically require one to eight weeks, depending on the size and complexity of each client, at which point the new client’s payroll is first processed using our solution. We implement additional HCM products as requested by clients and leverage the data within our payroll solution to accelerate our implementation processes. Our average client size has continued to be over 100 employees.
The number of client employees on our platform and the mix of products purchased by a client as well as the timing of services provided with respect to those client employees can vary each period. As such, the number of client employees on our system is not a good indicator of our financial results in any given period. Recurring and other revenue accounted for 99% and 94% of our total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and 99% and 95% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. While the majority of our agreements with clients are generally cancellable by the client on 60 days’ notice or less, we also have term agreements, which are generally two years in length. Our agreements do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. We recognize recurring fees in the period in which services are provided and the related performance obligations have been satisfied. We defer implementation fees related to our proprietary products over a period generally up to 24 months.
Interest Income on Funds Held for Clients We earn interest income on funds held for clients. We collect funds for employee payroll payments and related taxes in advance of remittance to employees and taxing authorities. Prior to remittance to employees and taxing authorities, we earn interest on these funds through demand deposit accounts with financial institutions with which we have automated clearing house, or ACH, arrangements. We also earn interest by investing a portion of funds held for clients in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.
22 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues includes costs to provide our HCM and payroll solutions which primarily consists of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, relating to the provision of ongoing client support and implementation activities, payroll tax filing, distribution of printed checks and other materials as well as delivery costs, computing costs, amortization of certain acquired intangibles and bank fees associated with client fund transfers. Costs related to recurring support are generally expensed as incurred. Implementation costs related to our proprietary products are capitalized and amortized over a period of 7 years. Our cost of revenues is expected to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we increase our client base. However, we expect to realize cost efficiencies over the long term as our business scales, resulting in improved operating leverage and increased margins. We also capitalize a portion of our internal-use software costs, which are then primarily amortized as Cost of revenues. We amortized $6.1 million and $7.5 million of capitalized internal-use software costs during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and $12.2 million and $14.5 million of capitalized internal-use software costs during the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff, including wages, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses, benefits, marketing expenses and other related costs. Our sales personnel earn commissions and bonuses for attainment of certain performance criteria based on new sales throughout the fiscal year. We capitalize certain selling and commission costs related to new contracts or purchases of additional services by our existing clients and amortize them over a period of 7 years.
We will seek to grow our number of clients for the foreseeable future, and therefore our sales and marketing expense is expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our sales organization and expand our marketing activities. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our research and development and product management teams, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, maintenance, quality assurance and testing of new technologies and ongoing refinement of our existing solutions. Research and development expenses, other than internal-use software costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred. We capitalize a portion of our development costs related to internal-use software. The timing of our capitalized development projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. The table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.

We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but to vary as a percentage of total revenue on a period-to-period basis. 23 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and other administrative departments. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, occupancy costs, insurance and other corporate expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as our company continues to grow. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) generally consists of interest income related to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, net of losses on disposals of property and equipment and interest expense related to our revolving credit facility.

Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was (127.8)% and (82.9)% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation, state and local income taxes, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation, state and local income taxes, and a decrease in the valuation allowance. Quarterly Trends and Seasonality Our overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Our historical results should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations. We experience fluctuations in revenues and related costs on a seasonal basis, which are primarily seen in our fiscal third quarter, which ends on March 31 of each year. Specifically, our recurring revenue is positively impacted in our fiscal third quarter as a result of our preparation of W-2 documents for our clients’ employees in advance of tax filing requirements. The seasonal fluctuations in revenues also positively impact gross profits during our fiscal third quarter. Our historical results for our fiscal third quarter should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations. Our interest income earned on funds held for clients is also positively impacted during our fiscal third quarter as a result of our increased collection of funds held for clients. Certain payroll taxes are primarily collected during our fiscal third quarter and subsequently remitted. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions and, to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and
29 Table of Contents actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Accounting estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes. Our critical accounting policies and use of estimates are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 5, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are related to the funding of general business requirements, including working capital requirements, research and development, and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2022, our principal source of liquidity was $120.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. In August 2022, we amended the credit agreement entered in July 2019 to increase the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to
$550.0
million, which may be increased up to
$825.0
million. No amounts were drawn on the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the amended credit agreement.
We may invest portions of our excess cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These investments may consist of commercial paper, corporate debt issuances, asset-backed debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and other securities with credit quality ratings of A-1 or higher. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any corporate investments. In order to grow our business, we intend to increase our personnel and related expenses and to make significant investments in our platform, data centers and general infrastructure. The timing and amount of these investments will vary based on our financial condition, the rate at which we add new clients and new personnel and the scale of our module development, data centers and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them, which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows during any particular period and may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. However, we expect to fund our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments principally with cash flows from operations, and to the extent that our liquidity needs exceed our cash from operations, we would look to our cash on hand or utilize the borrowing capacity under our credit facility to satisfy those needs.
Funds held for clients and client fund obligations will vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of payroll and tax obligations due. Our payroll processing activities involve the movement of significant funds from accounts of employers to employees and relevant taxing authorities. Though we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf, there is a delay between our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities and when the incoming funds from the client to cover these amounts payable actually clear into our operating accounts. We currently have agreements with eleven major U.S. banks to execute ACH and wire transfers to support our client payroll and tax services. We believe we have sufficient capacity under these ACH arrangements to handle all transaction volumes for the foreseeable future. We primarily collect fees for our services via ACH transactions at the same time we debit the client’s account for payroll and tax obligations and thus are able to reduce collectability and accounts receivable risks.
We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and access to our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditure and other liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter, for the foreseeable future.
30 Table of Contents The following table sets forth data regarding cash flows for the periods indicated: Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 26,858  $ 78,757  Cash flows from investing activities: Purchases of available-for-sale securities (190,000) (296,060) Proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities 60,391  190,253  Capitalized internal-use software costs (17,966) (19,740) Purchases of property and equipment (10,528) (6,663) Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (60,234) —  Other investing activities —  29  Net cash used in investing activities (218,337) (132,181) Cash flows from financing activities: Net change in client fund obligations 160,325  (922,079) Proceeds from employee stock purchase plan 7,216  8,450  Taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (67,109) (79,369) Payment of debt issuance costs (41) (864) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 100,391  (993,862) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and funds held for clients' cash and cash equivalents $ (91,088) $ (1,047,286) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $26.9 million and $78.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change in net cash provided by operating activities from the six months ended December 31, 2021 to the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to improved operating results after adjusting for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense and deferred income tax benefit, accompanied by net changes in operating assets and liabilities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $218.3 million and $132.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities is significantly impacted by the timing of purchases and sales and maturities of investments as we invest portions of funds held for clients in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. The amount of funds held for clients invested will vary based on timing of client funds collected and payments due to client employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities.
The change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $129.9 million in additional proceeds from the sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and a $60.2 million decrease in amounts paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $106.1 million in additional purchases of available-for-sale securities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $100.4 million and $(993.9) million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily the result of a decrease in the change in client fund obligations of $1,082.4 million due to the timing of client funds collected and related remittance of those funds to client employees and taxing authorities during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. 31 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2022, our principal commitments consisted of $86.0 million in operating lease obligations, of which $10.9 million is due in the next twelve months. We also had $59.3 million in purchase obligations, of which $30.2 million is due in the next twelve months. Capital Expenditures We expect to continue to invest in capital spending as we continue to grow our business and expand and enhance our operating facilities, data centers and technical infrastructure. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth. In the event that our sales growth or other factors do not meet our expectations, we may eliminate or curtail capital projects in order to mitigate the impact on our use of cash. Capital expenditures were $10.5 million and $6.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, exclusive of capitalized internal-use software costs of $18.0 million and $19.7 million for the same periods, respectively.

32 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We have operations primarily in the United States and are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate and certain other exposures including risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the United States. Refer to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” on our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 5, 2022 for risks related to our business as well as risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We have not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives to mitigate the impact of interest rate or other exposure or for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $120.1 million and funds held for clients of $3,065.7 million. We did not hold corporate investments on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. We deposit our cash and cash equivalents and significant portions of our funds held for clients in demand deposit accounts with various financial institutions. We invest portions of our excess cash and cash equivalents and funds held for clients in marketable securities including commercial paper, corporate debt issuances, asset-backed debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency securities and other which were classified as available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022. Our investment policy is focused on generating higher yields from these investments while preserving liquidity and capital. However, as a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our financial statements.
In a falling rate environment, a decline in interest rates would decrease our interest income earned on both cash and cash equivalents and funds held for clients. An increase in the overall interest rate environment may cause the market value of our investments in fixed rate available-for-sale securities to decline. If we are forced to sell some or all of these securities at lower market values, we may incur investment losses. However, because we classify all marketable securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates until such securities are sold or decreases in fair value are deemed due to expected credit losses. We have not recorded any credit impairment losses on our portfolio to date. Based upon a sensitivity model that measures market value changes caused by interest rate fluctuations, an immediate 100-basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the market value of our available-for-sale securities by $4.1 million as of December 31, 2022. An immediate 100-basis point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the market value of our available-for-sale securities by $4.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Fluctuations in the value of our available-for-sale securities caused by changes in interest rates are recorded in other comprehensive income and are only realized if we sell the underlying securities. Additionally, as described in
Note 8 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements,
we entered into a first amendment to our credit agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility (“credit facility”) in the aggregate amount of
$550.0
million, which may be increased up to
$825.0
million. Borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at a rate based upon the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus the SOFR Adjustment or an adjusted base rate plus an applicable margin based on our then-applicable net total leverage ratio. As of
December 31, 2022 , there were no amounts drawn on the credit facility. To the extent that we draw additional amounts under the credit facility, we may be exposed to increased market risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which affects our interest expense. Inflation Risk We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 33 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 34 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in litigation related to claims arising from the ordinary course of our business. We believe that there are no claims or actions pending or threatened against us, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on us. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes in our risk factors disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2022. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (a) Sales of Unregistered Securities Not applicable. (b) Use of Proceeds On March 24, 2014, we completed our initial public offering or IPO, of 8,101,750 shares of common stock, at a price of $17.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions.

With the proceeds of the IPO, we repaid amounts outstanding under a note issued by us to Commerce Bank & Trust Company on March 9, 2011, which totaled $1.1 million, paid $9.4 million for the purchase of substantially all of the assets of BFKMS Inc. and paid $9.5 million for the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Synergy Payroll, LLC. On December 17, 2014, we completed a follow-on offering of 4,960,000 shares of common stock at a price of $26.25 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the follow-on offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-200448) which was declared effective by the SEC on December 11, 2014.
