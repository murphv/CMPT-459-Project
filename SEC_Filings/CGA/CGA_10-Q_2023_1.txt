NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principle of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Green New Jersey, Jinong, Gufeng, Tianjuyuan, and the VIE Company.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
For purposes of comparability, certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented with its
former VIEs, Lishijie, Jinyangguang, Wangtian and Fengnong as a discontinued operation.
Effective June 16, 2013,
Yuxing was converted
from being a wholly owned foreign enterprise 100% owned by Jinong to a domestic enterprise 100% owned one natural person, who is not affiliated
to the Company (“Yuxing’s Owner”). Effective the same day, Yuxing’s Owner entered into a series of contractual
agreements with Jinong pursuant to which Yuxing became the VIE of Jinong.
VIE assessment
A VIE is an entity (1) that has total equity at
risk that is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other entities, (2) where
the group of equity holders does not have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s
economic performance, or the obligation to absorb the entity’s expected losses or the right to receive the entity’s expected
residual returns, or both, or (3) where the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected
losses of the entity, their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, or both, and substantially all of the entity’s
activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. In order to determine
if an entity is considered a VIE, the Company first performs a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding
its assessments, including, but not limited to, the design of the entity, the variability that the entity was designed to create and pass
along to its interest holders, the rights of the parties, and the purpose of the arrangement. If the Company cannot conclude after a qualitative
analysis whether an entity is a VIE, it performs a quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis considered the design of the entity,
the risks that cause variability, the purpose for which the entity was created, and the variability that the entity was designed to pass
along to its variable interest holders. When the primary beneficiary could not be identified through a qualitative analysis, we used internal
cash flow models to compute and allocate expected losses or expected residual returns to each variable interest holder based upon the
relative contractual rights and preferences of each interest holder in the VIE’s capital structure.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these
estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results and outcomes may differ from
management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment
due to the recent outbreak of a novel strain of the COVID-19.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a
lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement based
on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the implicit rate is typically not readily determinable in the Company’s
lease agreements, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of
the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company’s specific rate of interest to borrow on a collateralized
basis, over a similar term and in a similar economic environment as the lease. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease
expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, the Company accounts for lease and non-lease components
as a single lease component for its identified asset classes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have any material leases for
the implementation of ASC 842.

Cash and cash equivalents and concentration of cash
For statement of cash flows purposes, the Company
considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit with state owned banks in the PRC and banks in the United States, and
other highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company
maintains large sums of cash in three major banks in China. The aggregate cash in such accounts and on hand as of December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022 were $ 74,060,128
and $ 57,714,868 , respectively. There is no insurance securing these deposits in China. In addition,
the Company also had $ 59,020
and $ 55,435
in cash in two banks in the United States as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
Cash overdraft as of balance sheet date will be reflected as liabilities in the balance sheet. The Company has not experienced any losses
in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts.
Accounts receivable
Management regularly reviews the composition of
accounts receivable and analyzes customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate
the adequacy of these reserves at each year-end. Accounts considered uncollectible are provisioned for /written off based upon management’s
assessment. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the Company had accounts receivable of $
27,681,097
and $ 28,792,891 , net of allowance
for doubtful accounts of $ 56,174,302
and $ 58,000,266 , respectively. The impact of COVID-19 caused the difficulty of accounts receivable
collection from 2020 as numerous distributors encountered significant difficulties and/or hardships in their businesses amid the pandemic.
The company recorded bad debt expense in the amount of $ 2
and $ 25
million (included bad debt expense from discontinuing operations) for
six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company adopts no policy to accept product returns after the sales delivery.
Inventories
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost (determined
on a weighted average basis) or market. Inventories consist of raw materials, work in process, finished goods and packaging materials.
The Company reviews its inventories regularly for possible obsolete goods and establishes reserves when determined necessary. As of December
31, 2022, and 2021, the Company had no reserve for obsolete goods. The company confirmed the loss of $ 2
million and $ 11
million of inventories
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Intangible Assets
The Company records intangible assets acquired
individually or as part of a group at fair value. Intangible assets with definitive lives are amortized over the useful life of the intangible
asset, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the entity’s future cash flows.
The Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more often whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The Company has not recorded impairment of intangible assets as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively.
Customer deposits
Payments received before all the relevant criteria
for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as customer deposits. When all revenue recognition criteria are met, the customer deposits
are recognized as revenue. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the Company had customer deposits of $ 7,518,719
and $ 7,994,669 ,
respectively.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed based on
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the
weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using
the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.

The components of basic and diluted earnings per share consist of the

Recent accounting pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”), ASU 2019-12, “ Simplifying the Accounting for
Income Taxes.”
ASU 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, “ Income Taxes ,” and clarifies certain
aspects of ASC 740 to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a
prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company evaluated
the impact that with the adoption of ASU 2019-12, and it did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06,
Debt—Debt
with Conversion and Other Options
(Subtopic 470-20) and
Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
(Subtopic 815-40):
Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies accounting
for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions
that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation
in certain areas. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2023, although
early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial statements.
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
The Company’s financial statements are prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash
flows during the reporting period from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 and may continue to incur operating losses and generate
negative cash flows as the Company implements its future business plan. If the situation exists, there could be substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as going concern.
To meet its working capital needs through the
next twelve months and to fund the growth of the Company, the Company may consider plans to raise additional funds through the issuance
of equity or borrow loan from local bank. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully
execute its new business strategy and eventually attain profitable operations.
The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as going concern.

The convertible notes take priority over the preferred
stock and common stock of Jinong, and any other class or series of capital stocks Jinong issues in the future in terms of interests and
payments in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Jinong. On or after the third anniversary of the issuance date
of the note, noteholders may request Jinong to process the note conversion to convert the note into shares of the Company’s common
stock. The notes cannot be converted prior to the mature date.
The per share conversion price of the notes is the higher of the following:
(i) $5.00 per share or (ii) 75% of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date the noteholder delivers the conversion
notice.
Due to the discontinuation of VIE agreements with Zhenbai’s shareholders, certain convertible notes issued on June 30, 2016
with a face amount of RMB
12,000,000
($ 1,738,800 ) were tendered back to the Company. All outstanding balance of unpaid principal and accrued
interest in the tendered convertible notes were forfeited.
On November 21, 2019, the Company issued
995,000
shares of common stock at the price of $ 5.00
per share for the total amount of $ 4,975,000
to the holders of the Company’s convertible
notes payable in connection with the payment of the convertible notes’ principal and interests. The convertible notes were issued
on June 30, 2016 and matured on
June 30, 2019 .
On February 14, 2020, the Company issued
377,650
shares of common stock at the price of $ 5.00
per share for the total amount of $ 1,888,250
to the holders of the Company’s convertible
notes payable in connection with the payment of the convertible notes’ principal and interests. The convertible notes were issued
on January 1, 2017 and matured on
December 31, 2019 .
The Company determined that the fair value of
the convertible notes payable was
0
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Aside from the forfeiture of the convertible
notes previously issued to Zhenbai’s shareholders, the difference between the fair value of the notes and the face amount of the
notes is being amortized to accretion implied interest expense over the three-year life of the notes. As of December 31, 2022, the accumulated
amortization of this discount into accretion expenses was $ 1,375,499 . As of December 31, 2021, the accumulated amortization of this discount
into accretion expenses was $ 1,375,499 .

NOTE 12 – TAXES PAYABLE
Enterprise Income Tax
Effective January 1, 2008, the Enterprise Income
Tax (“EIT”) law of the PRC replaced the tax laws for Domestic Enterprises (“DEs”) and Foreign Invested Enterprises
(“FIEs”). The EIT rate of
25 % replaced the
33 % rate that was applicable to both DEs and FIEs.
The two-year tax exemption and
three-year 50% tax reduction tax holiday for production-oriented FIEs was eliminated.
Since January 1, 2008, Jinong became subject to
income tax in China at a rate of
15 % as a high-tech company, because of the expiration of its tax exemption on December 31, 2007. Accordingly,
it made provision for income taxes for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of
0
and
0 , respectively.
Value-Added Tax
All the Company’s fertilizer products that
are produced and sold in the PRC were subject to a Chinese Value-Added Tax (VAT) of
13 % of the gross sales price. On April 29, 2008, the
PRC State of Administration of Taxation (SAT) released Notice #56, “ Exemption of VAT for Organic Fertilizer Products ”,
which allows certain fertilizer products to be exempt from VAT beginning June 1, 2008. The Company submitted the application for exemption
in May 2009, which was granted effective September 1, 2009, continuing through December 31, 2015. On August 10, 2015 and August 28, 2015,
the SAT released Notice #90.
“ Reinstatement of VAT for Fertilizer Products ”, and Notice #97, “ Supplementary
Reinstatement of VAT for Fertilizer Products ”, which restore the VAT of 13% of the gross sales price on certain fertilizer products
includes non-organic fertilizer products starting from September 1, 2015, but granted taxpayers a reduced rate of 3% from September 1,
2015 through June 30, 2016.
On April 28, 2017, the PRC State of Administration
of Taxation (SAT) released Notice 2017 #37, “ Notice on Policy of Reduced Value Added Tax Rate, ” under which, effective
July 1, 2017, all the Company’s fertilizer products that are produced and sold in the PRC are subject to a Chinese Value-Added Tax
(VAT) of
11 % of the gross sales price. The tax rate was reduced
2 % from
13 %.
On April 4, 2018, the PRC State of Administration
of Taxation (SAT) released Notice 2018 #32, “ Notice on Adjustment of VAT Tax Rate, ” under which, effective May 1, 2018,
all the Company’s fertilizer products that are produced and sold in the PRC are subject to a Chinese Value-Added Tax (VAT) of
10 %
of the gross sales price. The tax rate was reduced
1 % from
11 %.
On March 20, 2019, the PRC State of Administration
of Taxation (SAT) released Notice 2019 #39, “ Announcement on Policies Concerning Deepening the Reform of Value Added Tax, ”
under which, effective April 1, 2019, all the Company’s fertilizer products that are produced and sold in the PRC are subject to
a Chinese Value-Added Tax (VAT) of
9 % of the gross sales price. The tax rate was reduced
1 % from

NOTE 17 – VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
In accordance with accounting standards regarding
consolidation of variable interest entities, VIEs are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without
additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision-making ability. All VIEs with which a company
is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required
to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes.
Green Nevada through one of its subsidiaries,
Jinong, entered into a series of agreements (the “VIE Agreements”) with Yuxing for it to qualify as a VIE, effective June
16, 2013.
The Company has concluded, based on the contractual
arrangements, that Yuxing is a VIE and that the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Jinong, absorbs most of the risk of loss from
the activities of Yuxing, thereby enabling the Company, through Jinong, to receive a majority of Yuxing expected residual returns.
On June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, the Company,
through its wholly owned subsidiary Jinong, entered into strategic acquisition agreements and into a series of contractual agreements

NOTE
19 – OTHER EVENTS
In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which was continuing to spread throughout
China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak
of the COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization
characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. The epidemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary
closure of office buildings and facilities in China and in the U.S.
Xi’an
City, where our headquarters are located, is one of the most affected areas in China. The Company has been following the orders of local
government and health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees, including the closures of its offices and having employees
work remotely from January of 2020 until March of 2020. An occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively
affect our operations and financial results.
Substantially
all our revenues are generated in China. Consequently, our results of operations were adversely and materially affected by COVID-19.
Any potential impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding
the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 or treat
its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control. Potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:
●
temporary closure of offices,
travel restrictions or suspension of transportation of our products to our customers and our suppliers have been negatively affected,
and could continue to be negatively affected, on their ability to supply our demands;
●
our customers that are
negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may reduce their budgets to purchase our products and services, which may materially
adversely impact our revenue;
●
we may have to provide
significant sales incentives to our customers in response to the outbreak, which may in turn materially adversely affect our financial
condition and operating results;
●
the business operations
of our customers and suppliers have been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the outbreak, result in loss of customers
or disruption of our services, which may in turn materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;
●
any disruption of our supply
chain, logistics providers or customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including causing our suppliers
to cease manufacturing products for a period or materially delay delivery to customers, which may also lead to loss of customers,
as well as reputational, competitive and business harm to us;
●
many of our customers,
distributors, suppliers and other partners are individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong
cash flows or be well capitalized, and may be vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. If the SMEs
that we work with cannot weather COVID-19 and the resulting economic impact, or cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged
outbreak, our revenues and business operations may be materially and adversely impacted;
●
the global stock markets
have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant decline from the COVID-19 outbreak, which could materially adversely
affect our stock price;
Because
of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the financial impact related to the outbreak of and response to the COVID-19 cannot
be reasonably estimated at this time, but our results for the full fiscal year of 2022 and first half of fiscal year 2023 had been adversely
affected.
In
general, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of epidemics, including, but not limited to, the COVID-19, avian influenza,
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A virus, the Ebola virus, or other outbreaks. In response to an epidemic or other
outbreaks, government and other organizations may adopt regulations and policies that could lead to severe disruption to our daily operations,
including temporary closure of our offices and other facilities. These severe conditions may cause us and/or our partners to make internal
adjustments, including but not limited to, temporarily closing business, limiting business hours, and setting restrictions on travel
and/or visits with clients and partners for a prolonged period. Various impacts arising from severe conditions may cause business disruption,
resulting in material, adverse effects to our financial condition and results of operations.
We
are taking significant measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19 as well as additional actions to improve
our liquidity through cost reduction and conservation measures.

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contain
forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as the slow-down of the
macro-economic environment in China and its impact on economic growth in general, the competition in the fertilizer industry and the
impact of such competition on pricing, revenues and margins, the weather conditions in the areas where our customers are based, the cost
of attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel, the prospects for future acquisitions, and the factors set forth elsewhere in this
report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. With these risks and uncertainties,

in this report is a statement of our intention as of the date of this report and is based upon, among other things, the existing regulatory
environment, industry conditions, market conditions and prices, and our assumptions as of such date. We may change our intentions,

Overview
We
are engaged in the research, development, production, and sale of various types of fertilizers and agricultural products in the PRC through
our wholly owned Chinese subsidiaries, Jinong and Gufeng (including Gufeng’s subsidiary Tianjuyuan), and our VIE, Yuxing. Our primary
business is fertilizer products, specifically humic-acid based compound fertilizer produced by Jinong and compound fertilizer, blended
fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizer, highly concentrated water-soluble fertilizer, and mixed organic-inorganic
compound fertilizer produced by Gufeng. In addition, through Yuxing, we develop and produce various agricultural products, such as top-grade
fruits, vegetables, flowers and colored seedlings. For financial reporting purposes, our operations are organized into three business
segments: fertilizer products (Jinong), fertilizer products (Gufeng) and agricultural products (Yuxing).
The
fertilizer business conducted by Jinong and Gufeng generated approximately 89.0% and 92.1% of our total revenues for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Yuxing serves as a research and development base for our fertilizer products.

Pursuant
to the SAA and the ACN, the shareholders of the Targets, while retaining possession of the equity interests and continuing to be the
legal owners of such interests, agreed to pledge and entrust all of their equity interests, including the proceeds thereof (but excluding
any claims or encumbrances), and the operations and management of its business to Jinong, in exchange for an aggregate amount of RMB45,000,000
(approximately $6,520,500) to be paid by Jinong within three days following the execution of the SAA, ACN and the VIE Agreements, and
convertible notes with an aggregate face value of RMB 63,000,000 (approximately $9,128,700) with an annual fixed compound interest rate
of 3% and term of three years.
Jinong
acquired the Targets using the VIE arrangement based on our need to further develop our business and comply with the regulatory requirements
under the PRC laws.
As
our business focuses on the production of fertilizer, all our business activities intertwine with those in the agriculture industry in
China. Specifically, we deal with compliance, regulation, safety, inspection, and licenses in fertilizer production, farmland use and
transfer, growing and distribution of agriculture goods, agriculture basic supplies, seeds, pesticides, and trades of grains. It is an
industry in which heavy regulations get implemented and strictly enforced. In addition, E-commerce, which is also under strict government
regulation in the PRC, has lately become a sales and distribution channel for agricultural products. Currently, we are developing an
online platform to connect the physical distribution network we either own or lease.
Compared
with the regulatory environment in other jurisdictions, the regulatory environment in the PRC is unique. For example, the “M&A
Rules” purports to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals
and formed for purposes of overseas listing through acquisition of PRC domestic interests held by such PRC companies or individuals obtain
the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) prior to the listing and trading of such special
purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published procedures regarding its
approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles.
For
both e-commerce and agriculture industries, PRC regulators limit the investment from foreign entities and set particularly rules for
foreign-owned entities to conduct business. We expect these limitations on foreign-owned entities will continue to exist in e-commerce
and agriculture industries. The VIE arrangement, however, provides feasibility for obtaining administrative approval process and avoiding
industry restrictions that can be imposed on an entity that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign entity. The VIE agreements reduce
uncertainty and the current limitation risk. It is our understanding that the VIE agreements, as well as the control we obtained through
VIE arrangement, are valid and enforceable. Such legal structure does not violate the known, published, and current PRC laws. While there
are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there
can be no assurance that the PRC authorities will take a view that is not contrary to or otherwise different from our belief and understanding
stated above, we believe the substantial difficulty that we experienced previously to conduct business in agriculture as a foreign ownership
can be greatly reduced by the VIE arrangement. Further, as an integral part of the VIE arrangement, the underlying equity pledge agreements
provide legal protection for the control we obtained. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements, we have completed the equity pledge processes
with the Targets to ensure the complete control of the interests in the Targets. The shareholders of the Targets are not entitled to
transfer any shares to a third party under the exclusive option agreements. If necessary, they may transfer shares to our company without
consideration.
While
the VIE arrangement provides us with the feasibility to conduct our business in the E-Commerce and agriculture industries, validity and
enforceability of VIE arrangement is subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, (ii) possible judicial or administrative actions or any PRC Laws affecting
creditors’ rights, (iii) certain equitable, legal or statutory principles affecting the validity and enforceability of contractual
rights generally under concepts of public interest, interests of the State, national security, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing,
and applicable statutes of limitation; (iv) any circumstance in connection with formulation, execution or implementation of any legal
documents that would be deemed materially mistaken, clearly unconscionable, fraudulent, coercive at the conclusions thereof; and (v)
judicial discretion with respect to the availability of indemnifications, remedies or defenses, the calculation of damages, the entitlement
to attorney’s fees and other costs, and the waiver of immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from legal process. Validity and
enforceability of VIE arrangement is also subject to risk derived from the discretion of any competent PRC legislative, administrative
or judicial bodies in exercising their authority in the PRC. As a result, there can no assurance that any of such PRC Laws will not be
changed, amended or replaced in the immediate future or in the longer term with or without retrospective effect.

from
$30,128,261 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was mainly due to Jinong’s lower sales volume in the last

Discussion
of Segment Profitability Measures
As
of December 31, 2022, we were engaged in the following businesses: the production and sale of fertilizers through Jinong and Gufeng,
and the production and sale of high-quality agricultural products by Yuxing. For financial reporting purpose, our operations were organized
into three main business segments based on locations and products: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production) and
Yuxing (agricultural products production). Each of the segments has its own annual budget about development, production and sales.
Each
of the three operating segments referenced above has separate and distinct general ledgers. The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)
makes decisions with respect to resources allocation and performance assessment upon receiving financial information, including revenue,
gross margin, operating income and net income produced from the various general ledger systems; however, net income by segment is the
principal benchmark to measure profit or loss adopted by the CODM.
For
Jinong, the net (loss) decreased by $5,635,567, or 90.8%, to $(570,428) for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from net (loss) of
$(6,205,995) for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net (loss) was principally due to lower general and administrative
expense.
For
Gufeng, the net (loss) decreased by $27,777,553, or 92.2%, to net (loss) of $(2,336,623) for the six months ended December 31, 2022,
from net (loss) of $(30,114,176) for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was principally due to the decrease in general
and administrative expense.
For
Yuxing, the net income increased $97,172 or 24.5%, to $494,176 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $397,004 for the six months
ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly due to the decrease in general and administrative expense.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Our
principal sources of liquidity include cash from operations, borrowings from local commercial banks and net proceeds of offerings of
our securities.
As
of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $74,119,148, an increase of $16,348,846, or 28.3%, from $57,770,303 as of June 30,
2022.
We
intend to use the net proceeds from our securities offerings, as well as other working capital if required, to acquire new businesses,
upgrade production lines and complete Yuxing’s new greenhouse facilities for agriculture products located on 88 acres of land in
Hu County, 18 kilometers southeast of Xi’an city. We believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and positive projected cash flow
from operations to support our business growth for the next twelve months to the extent we do not have further significant acquisitions
or expansions. However, if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected, we may be required to seek
additional capital and/or to reduce certain discretionary spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve
our business objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion purposes and when
we believe market conditions are most advantageous, which may include additional debt and/or equity financings. There can be no assurance
that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Any equity financing may result in dilution to existing
stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants.

or 3.9%.
Allowance
for doubtful accounts in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 was $56,174,302, a decrease of $1,825,964, or 3.1%, from $58,000,266
as of June 30, 2022. And the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable was 67.0% as of December 31, 2022
and 66.8% as of June 30, 2022.
Deferred
assets
We
had no deferred assets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. During the three months, we assisted the distributors in certain marketing
efforts and developing standard stores to expand our competitive advantage and market shares. Based on the distributor agreements, the
amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing efforts and store development will be expensed over three years if the distributors
are actively selling our products. If a distributor defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement with us earlier than the contractual
terms, the unamortized portion of the amount owed by the distributor is payable to us immediately. The deferred assets had been
fully amortized as of December 31, 2022.
39
Inventories
We
had inventories of $45,820,848 as of December 31, 2022, as compared to $42,198,186 as of June 30, 2022, a increase of $3,622,662, or
8.6%. The increase was primarily attributable to Yuxing’s inventory. As of December 31, 2022, Yuxing’s inventory was $ 24,298,292,
compared to $ 22,062,527 as of June 30, 2022, an increase of $ 2,235,765, or 10.1%. The company confirmed the loss of $2 million and
$11 million of inventories for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Advances
to Suppliers
We
had advances to suppliers of $7,272,629 as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $20,711,891 as of June 30, 2022, representing a decrease
of $13,439,262, or 64.9%. Our inventory level may fluctuate from time to time, depending how quickly the raw material is consumed and
replenished during the production process, and how soon the finished goods are sold. The replenishment of raw material relies on
management’s estimate of numerous factors, including but not limited to, the raw materials future price, and spot price along with
its volatility, as well as the seasonal demand and future price of finished fertilizer products. Such estimate may not be accurate,
and the purchase decision of raw materials based on the estimate can cause excessive inventories in times of slow sales and insufficient
inventories in peak times.
Accounts
Payable
We
had accounts payable of $1,928,691 as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $1,670,655 as of June 30, 2022, representing an increase of
$ 258,035, or 15.4%.
Customer
Deposits (Unearned Revenue)
We
had customer deposits of $7,518,719 as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $7,994,669 as of June 30, 2022, representing a decrease of
$475,950, or 6.0%. The decrease was mainly attributable to Jinong’ $ 3,065,726 unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022, compared
to $3,539,323 unearned revenue as of June 30, 2022, decreased $473,597, or 13.4%, caused by the advance deposits made by clients. This
decrease was due to seasonal fluctuation and we expect to deliver products to our customers during the next three months at which time
we will recognize the revenue.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our financial statements reflect the selection
and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments. See Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” We believe that the following
paragraphs reflect the most critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations:
Use
of estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However,
actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty
in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19.
40
Revenue
recognition
Sales
revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the
delivery is completed, we have no other significant obligations and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all
the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.
Our
revenue consists of invoiced value of goods, net of a value-added tax (VAT). No product return or sales discount allowance is made as
products delivered and accepted by customers are normally not returnable and sales discounts are normally not granted after products
are delivered.
Cash
and cash equivalents
For
statement of cash flows purposes, we consider all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.
Accounts
receivable
Our
policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable
and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer
payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Any accounts receivable of Jinong and Gufeng that are outstanding for more
than 180 days will be accounted as allowance for bad debts, and any accounts receivable of Yuxing that are outstanding for more than
90 days will be accounted as allowance for bad debts.
Deferred
assets
Deferred
assets represent amounts the Company advanced to the distributors in their marketing and stores development to expand our competitive
advantage and market shares. Based on the distributor agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing efforts
and store development will be expensed over three years if the distributors are actively selling our products. If a distributor defaults,
breaches, or terminates the agreement with us earlier than the realization of the contractual terms, the unamortized portion of the amount
owed by the distributor is to be refunded to us immediately. The deferred assets had been fully amortized as of December 31, 2022.
Segment
reporting
FASB
ASC 280 requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on
the way a company’s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other way management
disaggregates a company.
As
of December 31, 2022, we were organized into three main business units: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production),
and Yuxing (agricultural products production). For financial reporting purpose, our operations were organized into three main business
segments based on locations and products: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production), and Yuxing (agricultural products
production). Each of the segments has its own annual budget regarding development, production, and sales.
41
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Disclosures
About Market Risk
We
may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business. Market risk generally represents the risk
that losses may occur because of movements in interest rates and equity prices. We currently do not, in the normal course of business,
use financial instruments that are subject to changes in financial market conditions.
Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk
Substantially
all our revenues and expenses are denominated in RMB. However, we use the U.S. dollar for financial reporting purposes. Conversion of
RMB into foreign currencies is regulated by the People’s Bank of China through a unified floating exchange rate system. Although
the PRC government has stated its intention to support the value of RMB, there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again
become volatile or that RMB will not devalue significantly against U.S. dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value,
in U.S. dollar terms, of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the PRC.
Our
reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Except for U.S. holding companies, all our consolidated revenues, consolidated costs and expenses,
and our assets are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations
may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollars and RMB. If RMB depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the
value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline. Assets and liabilities
are translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates,
and shareholders’ equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Any resulting translation adjustments are not included in
determining net income (loss) but are included in determining other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders’ equity.
As of December 31, 2022, our accumulated other comprehensive loss was $18 million. We have not entered any hedging transactions to reduce
our exposure to foreign exchange risk. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other
things, changes in PRC’s political and economic conditions. Between July 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, China’s currency
decreased by a cumulative 2.9% against the U.S. dollar, making Chinese exports cheaper and imports into China more expensive by that
percentage. The effect on trade can be substantial. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, the PRC authorities may lift restrictions
on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.
Interest
Rate Risk
We
deposit surplus funds with Chinese banks earning daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. All our outstanding
debt instruments carry fixed rates of interest. The amount of short-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was
$5.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short-term bank loans.
Although the interest rates, which are based on the banks’ prime rates with respect to our short-term loans, are fixed for the
terms of the loans, the terms are typically three to twelve months for short-term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change
upon renewal. There was no material change in interest rates for short-term bank loans renewed during the three months ended December
31, 2022. The original loan term on average is one year, and the remaining average life of the short term-loans is approximately seven
months.
Management
monitors the banks’ prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative
to other sources of funds. We have not entered any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk.
Credit
Risk
We
have not experienced significant credit risk, as most of our customers are long-term customers with superior payment records. Our receivables
are monitored regularly by our credit managers.
42
Inflation
Risk
Inflationary
factors such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Notwithstanding
the measures taken by the PRC government to control inflation, China still experienced an increase in inflation and our operating cost
became higher than anticipated.  The high rate of inflation had an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross
margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not
increase with these increased costs.
Risk
of epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks
The
outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our
operations. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply
chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, and credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail
to satisfy their obligations to us. We share most of these risks with all businesses.
In
addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The current outbreak and continued spread
of COVID-19 may cause a global recession, which would have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations, and this
impact could exist for an extensive period.
The
Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of
relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance
is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing,
extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition
of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.
Additional
future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company’s products
and services; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company’s ability to execute its strategic
plans; and the Company’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s
business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks
described above.

Pursuant
