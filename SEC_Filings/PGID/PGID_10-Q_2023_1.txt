Notes to Financial Statements For the Six Months Ended January 31, 2023   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS:   Peregrine Industries, Inc. (the "Company") was formed on October 1, 1995 for the purpose of manufacturing residential pool heaters. The Company was formerly located in Deerfield Beach, Florida. Products were primarily sold throughout the United States, Canada, and Brazil. In June 2002, the Registrant and its subsidiaries filed a petition for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida. At present, the Company has no business operations and is deemed to be a shell company. The Company had a change in control on July 8, 2013 as a result of the sale by our former principal shareholders, Richard Rubin, Thomas J. Craft, Jr. and Ivo Heiden, of their
324,000
shares of common stock, representing approximately
61.8 % of the Company's outstanding common stock, to Dolomite Industries Ltd ("Dolomite"). In connection with the private sale of their shares of common stock to Dolomite on July 2, 2013, Messrs. Rubin and Heiden agreed to waive a total of $ 224,196
in liabilities owed to them at June 30, 2013. In connection with the change of control transaction, two former principal shareholders transferred and assigned all $ 195,000
of their two convertible notes to three unaffiliated third parties and one affiliated party. See also note 3. On June 12, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Registrant appointed Mr. Zohar Shpitz as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Registrant. Mr. Shpitz was appointed as CFO in connection with the resignation of Mr. Ofer Naveh as the Registrant's CFO, effective June 19, 2017.  On July 21, 2017, new management acquired,
22,477,843
or
97.7 % of the issued common restricted shares.  The new management is developing a business plan which they anticipate implementing within the current fiscal year.   On September 3, 2021, through our wholly owned subsidiary Mace Merger, Corp., Mace, Corporation was merged into our Company, through the issuance to each shareholders of one share of Peregrine, Industries for each four share of Mace, Corporation which they held. A total of
250,000,000
were issued. The
22,477,843
shares held, by the new management, per the above paragraph, were returned to the Company for cancelation.   NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Peregrine Industries, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the period ended July 31, 2021 contained in the Company’s Form 10K originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2021.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the period ended July 31, 2022, filed on October 31, 2022, as reported in the Company’s Form 10K, have been omitted.     8 Table of Contents   Peregrine Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Six Months Ended January 31, 2023   Use of Estimates:   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.   Cash, Land and Building   On October 28, 2021, Mace Corporation completed the sale of its land and building, located at 9171 W Flamingo Rd., Las Vegas, Nevada.  Net proceeds of $ 632,629 , resulting from the sale price of $ 679,000 , were held in escrow and received by the Company on November 2, 2021.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Accounts receivable as of January 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022 were $ 19,384
and $ 22,654 , respectively. An allowance for doubtful accounts will be provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectable based on historical experience and management’s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable at the end of the period. Management has reviewed the current accounts receivable and has concluded that no allowance was necessary as of January31, 2023 and July 31, 2022.  Bad debts will be written off against the allowance when identified.
Inventory   As at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, the Company had $ 736,004
and $ 784,294
worth of inventory, stated at the lower of cost or market, valued on an average cost basis. The inventory is reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted for discrepancies and value. Managements’ evaluation was that impairment of $ 47,356
was required on October 31, 2022.  No additional impairment was required for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 nor on July 31, 2022.   Production Molds   The building of production molds is outsourced to specialists and is recorded at the total cost to acquire each. The molds are built to specifications that include the number of parts anticipated to be produced. The cost of the mold is depreciated on a straight line basis over
5
years. Cost of repairs and maintenance will be expensed as incurred. The value of each mold is reviewed quarterly and will be impaired, when necessary, based on managements’ valuation of the molds continuing viability. Depreciation of $ 359,040
has been recorded through January 31, 2023. Because the molds were totally depreciated no depreciation was recorded for the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $ 39,705
for the six months ended January 31, 2022.   Patents
Patent costs consist of the legal fees paid to prepare, file and process the patent applications. Patents will be amortized, utilizing the straight line method, over the useful life of the patent and will be reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment is required. Research and development costs are not included in the cost of patents, and, are expensed as incurred.  Our company paid $ 3,090
new patent fees during the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $ 7,149
during the same six months last year.  During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company reviewed and fully impaired patents with an original cost of $ 3,725 .     9 Table of Contents   Peregrine Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Six Months Ended January 31, 2023   Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.   Income taxes   The Company follows ASC Topic 740 for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.   Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.   The Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic 740 only allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2020, the Company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding, or retroactive tax positions with less than a
50 % likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the Company.   The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.   The Company classifies tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. As of January 31, 2023, no income tax expense has been incurred.   NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN:   The Company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has accumulated losses aggregating $ 4,597,622
and $ 4,434,068
as of January 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022, respectively. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded a loss of $ 163,553 , which included an inventory valuation write down of $ 47,356 , compared to a profit for the six months ended January 31, 2022 of $ 24,577
which included profit of $ 198,204
derived from the sale of its building, plus $ 10,000
from debt forgiveness.
10 Table of Contents   Peregrine Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Six Months Ended January 31, 2023   The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   The Company is taking appropriate action to provide the necessary capital to continue its operations. These steps include, but are not limited to: 1) implementation of new business plan 2)focus on sales to minimize the need for capital at this stage; 3) raising equity financing; 4) continuous focus on reductions in cost where possible.   NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:   On May 17, 2021, a related party loaned the Company $ 50,000

Notes to Financial Statements For the Six Months Ended January 31, 2023   NOTE 6 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGIES   Leases   Prior to April 1, 2022, our office was located in 9171 W Flamingo Rd, Las Vegas. We sold the property on October 28, 2021 and subsequently signed a lease agreement for the same building for approximately 8 months from October 28, 2021 to June 30, 2022.  No ASC Topic 842 was implemented under this agreement since it’s under 1 year. Effective April 1, 2022, we moved to 4525 W Reno Avenue, Las Vegas
under a 24-month rental agreement covering April 1, 2022 through March 31, 2024, with an initial monthly rental rate of $1,525 in first year increasing to a monthly rate of $1,600 in second year.
At January 31, 2023, in accordance with ASC Topic 842, we recognized a right of use (“ROU”) asset of $ 19,779
and an operating lease liability of $ 21,659 , of which $ 19,050
was classified as a current liability and $ 2,609
as non-current liability.. The lease liability is determined by discounting the future lease payments under the lease terms and applying a
