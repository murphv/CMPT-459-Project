SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting
Basis
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures included in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)
and reflect all adjustments, which consist solely of normal recurring adjustments, needed to fairly present the financial results for
these periods. Additionally, these condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are presented pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures contained in the Company’s Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022.
The results for the three and nine month period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the entire fiscal year. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
have been made, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of (a) the results of operations for
the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, (b) the financial position at December 31, 2022, and (c) cash flows
for the nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
We
use the accrual basis of accounting and U.S. GAAP and all amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company has a fiscal year-end of
March 31 st .
Unless
the context otherwise requires, all references to “Ammo”, “we”, “us”, “our,” or the “Company”
are to AMMO, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AMMO, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing
the condensed consolidated financial statements include the valuation of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of deferred tax
assets, inventories, useful lives of assets, goodwill, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and warrant-based compensation.
Goodwill
We evaluate
goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce
the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative
assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If
our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test
goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting
unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not
that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair
value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of
future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion,
pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Due to the declines in the value of our stock price and market capitalization,
we assessed qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Marketplace segment is less than
its carrying amount. Through our analysis we determined our stock price and market capitalization decline it is not indicative of a decrease
in the the fair value of our Marketplace segment and a fair value calculation using the discounted cash flows was more appropriate due
to the operational performance of the reporting segment. Accordingly, the impairment of Goodwill was not warranted for the three and
nine months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a goodwill carrying value of $ 90,870,094 , all of which
is assigned to the Marketplace segment. However, due to declines in the value of the Company’s common stock and market capitalization,
it is possible that the book values of our Marketplace segment could exceed its fair value, which may result in the recognition of a
material, noncash impairment of goodwill for the year ending March 31, 2023.

TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Our
accounts receivable represents amounts due from customers for products sold and include an allowance for uncollectible accounts which
is estimated based on the aging of the accounts receivable and specific identification of uncollectible accounts. At December 31, 2022
and March 31, 2022, we reserved $ 4,382,671
and $ 3,055,252 , respectively, of allowance for doubtful accounts.
Restricted
Cash
We
consider cash to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. Our restricted cash balance is comprised of cash
on deposit with banks to secure the Construction Note Payable as discussed in Note 10. We report restricted cash in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.
License
Agreements
We
are a party to a license agreement with Jesse James, a well-known motorcycle designer, and Jesse James Firearms, LLC, a Texas limited
liability company. The license agreement grants us the exclusive worldwide rights through April 12, 2026 to Mr. James’ image rights
and trademarks associated with him in connection with the marketing, promotion, advertising, sale, and commercial exploitation of Jesse
James Branded Products. We agreed to pay Mr. James royalty fees on the sale of ammunition and non-ammunition Branded Products and to
reimburse him for any out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable travel expenses.
Patents
On
September 28, 2017, AMMO Technologies Inc. (“ATI”), an Arizona corporation, which is 100% owned by us, merged with Hallam,
Inc, a Texas corporation, with ATI being the survivor. The primary asset of Hallam, Inc. was an exclusive license to produce projectiles
and ammunition using the Hybrid Luminescence Ammunition Technology under patent U.S. 8,402,896 B1 with a publication date of March 26,
2013 owned by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The license was formally amended and assigned to AMMO Technologies Inc. pursuant
to an Assignment and First Amendment to Exclusive License Agreement. Assumption Agreement dated to be effective as of August 22, 2017,
the Merger closing date. This asset will be amortized from September 2017, the first full month of the acquired rights, through October
29, 2028.
Under
the terms of the Exclusive License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a quarterly royalty to the patent holder, based on a $ 0.01
per unit basis for each round of ammunition sold that incorporates this patented technology through October 29, 2028. For the nine months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized royalty expenses of $ 89,340
and $ 18,558 , respectively under this agreement.

AMMO,
Inc.
NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On
October 5, 2018, we completed the acquisition of SW Kenetics Inc. ATI succeeded all of the assets of SW Kenetics, Inc. and assumed all
of the liabilities.
The
primary asset of SW Kenetics Inc. was a pending patent for modular projectiles. All rights to patent pending application were assigned
and transferred to AMMO Technologies, Inc. pursuant to Intellectual Property Rights Agreement on September 27, 2018.
We
intend to continue building our patent portfolio to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, and will file new applications
where appropriate to preserve our rights to manufacture and sell our branded lines of ammunition.
Other
Intangible Assets
On
March 15, 2019, Enlight Group II, LLC d/b/a Jagemann Munition Components, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMMO, Inc., completed its acquisition
of assets of Jagemann Stamping Company’s ammunition casing manufacturing and sales operations pursuant to the terms of the Amended
and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement. The intangible assets acquired include a tradename, customer relationships, and intellectual property.
On
April 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, SpeedLight
Group I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and Gemini Direct Investments, LLC, a
Nevada limited liability company. Whereby SpeedLight Group I, LLC merged with and into Gemini Direct Investments, LLC, with SpeedLight
Group I, LLC surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the time of the Merger, Gemini Direct Investments,
LLC had nine (9) subsidiaries, all of which are related to Gemini’s ownership of Gunbroker.com, an online auction marketplace dedicated
to firearms, hunting, shooting, and related products. The intangible assets acquired include a tradename, customer relationships, intellectual
property, software and domain names.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
We
continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the
carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows
is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
No
impairment expense was recognized for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Revenue
Recognition
We
generate revenue from the production and sale of ammunition, ammunition casings, and marketplace fee revenue, which includes auction
revenue, payment processing revenue, and shipping income. We recognize revenue according to Accounting Standard Codification –
Revenue from Contract with Customers (“ASC 606”). When the customer obtains control over the promised goods or services,
we record revenue in the amount of consideration that we can expect to receive in exchange for those goods and services. We apply the
following five-step model to determine revenue recognition:
●
Identification
of a contract with a customer
●
Identification
of the performance obligations in the contact
●
Determination
of the transaction price
●
Allocation
of the transaction price to the separate performance allocation
●
Recognition
of revenue when performance obligations are satisfied
11
AMMO,
Inc.
NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We
only apply the five-step model when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods
or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception and once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606,
we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, and assess whether
each promised good or service is distinct.
For Ammunition Sales and Casing Sales, our contracts
contain a single performance obligation and the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. We recognize
as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation
is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Accordingly, we recognize revenues (net) when the customer obtains control of our product, which typically
occurs upon shipment of the product or the performance of the service. In the year ended March 31, 2021, we began accepting contract liabilities
or deferred revenue. We included Deferred Revenue in our Accrued Liabilities. We will recognize revenue when the performance obligation
is met.
For Marketplace revenue, the performance
obligation is satisfied, and revenue is recognized as follows:
Auction revenue consists of optional
listing fees with variable pricing components based on customer options selected from the GunBroker website and final value fees based
on a percentage of the final selling price of the listed item. The performance obligation is to process the transactions as initiated
by the customer. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the transaction is processed.
Payment processing revenue consists
of fees charged to customers on a transactional basis. The performance obligation is to process the transactions as initiated by the customer.
The price is set by the GunBroker user agreement on the website based on stand-alone selling prices. Revenue is recognized at a point
in time when the transaction is processed.
Shipping income consists of fees
charged to customers for shipping of sold items listed on the GunBroker website. The performance obligation is to ship the item sold as
initiated by the customer. The price is set based on the third-party service provider selected to be used by the customer as well as the
speed and location of shipment. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the shipping label is printed.
Banner Advertising Campaign Revenue
consists of fees charged to customers for advertisement placement and impressions generated through the GunBroker website. The performance
obligation is to generate the number of impressions specified by the customer on banner advertisements on the GunBroker website using
the placement selected by the customer. The price is set by the GunBroker user agreement on the website based on standalone selling prices,
or by advertising insertion order as negotiated by media broker. If the number of impressions promised is not generated, the customer
receives a refund and the refund is applied to the transaction price. Banner advertising campaigns generally run for one month, and revenue
is recognized at a point in time at the end of the selected month.
Product Sales consists of fees
charged for the liquidation of excess inventory for partner distributors. The performance obligation is to sell and ship the inventory
item as initiated by the customer. The price depends on whether the inventory is a fixed price item or an auction item. For a fixed price
item, the Company performs research to determine the current market rate for such an item, and the item is listed at that price. For an
auction item, the price is set by what the buyer is willing to pay. The Company acts as a principal in these transactions due to the extent
of control they have over the product prior to the sale. Due to the principal determination, gross revenue is recognized at a point in
time when the item has been shipped.
Identity Verification
consists of fees charged to customers for identity verification in order to gain access to the GunBroker website. The performance obligation
is to process the identity verification as initiated by the customer. The price is set by the GunBroker user agreement on the website
based on a stand-alone selling price. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the identity verification is completed.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to us as of December
31, 2022. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair value. These
financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, amounts due to related parties, factoring liability, and the construction note payable. Fair values were assumed
to approximate carrying values because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are
payable on demand.
Inventories
We
state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost using the average cost method. Our inventory consists
of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. Cost of inventory includes cost of parts, labor, quality control, and all other
costs incurred to bring our inventories to condition ready to be sold. We periodically evaluate and adjust inventories for obsolescence.

Property
and Equipment
We
state property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation. We capitalize major renewals and improvements, while we charge minor
replacements, maintenance, and repairs to current operations. We compute depreciation by applying the straight-line method over estimated
useful lives, which are generally five to ten years.
Compensated
Absences
We
accrue a liability for compensated absences in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 710 – Compensation – General
(“ASC 710”) .
Research
and Development
To
date, we have expensed all costs associated with developing our product specifications, manufacturing procedures, and products through
our cost of products sold, as this work was done by the same employees who produced the finished product. We anticipate that it may become
necessary to reclassify research and development costs into our operating expenditures for reporting purposes as we begin to develop
new technologies and lines of ammunition.
Stock-Based
Compensation
We
account for stock-based compensation at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718 – Compensation –
Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards to employees and directors. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting periods and
forfeitures are recognized in the periods they occur. There were
604,510
and
1,281,635
shares of common stock issued to employees, members
of the Board of Directors, and members of our advisory committee for services during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022
Concentrations
of Credit Risk
Accounts
at banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $ 250,000 . As of December 31, 2022, our bank
account balances exceeded federally insured limits.
Income
Taxes
We
file federal and state income tax returns in accordance with the applicable rules of each jurisdiction. We account for income taxes under
the asset and liability method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740 – Income Taxes (“ASC 740”).
The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, and local income taxes currently payable, and deferred taxes. We recognize deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable amounts in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized. In accordance
with ASC 740, we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
We
measure recognized income tax positions at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized . We reflect changes in
recognition or measurement in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
Excise
Tax
As
a result of regulations imposed by the Federal Government for sales of ammunition to non-government U.S. entities, we charge and collect
an
11 % excise tax for all products sold into these channels. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized approximately
$ 7.8
million and $ 10.3
million respectively, in excise taxes. For ease in selling to commercial markets, excise tax is included in our
unit price for the products sold. We record this through net sales and expense the offsetting tax expense to cost of goods sold.

Contingencies
Certain conditions may exist as of the date the condensed
consolidated financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will only be resolved when one or more future events
occur or fail to occur. We assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing
loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings,
we evaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims and the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought
or expected to be sought therein.
If the
assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability is
reasonably estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in our condensed consolidated financial statements. If the assessment
indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be
estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of range of possible loss if determinable and
material, would be disclosed. On September 24, 2019, the Company received notice that a former employee that had voluntarily
terminated filed a complaint against the Company, and certain individuals, with the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”).
The Complaint in alleges that the individual reported potential violations of SEC rules and regulations by management and that as a
result of such disclosures, the individual experienced a hostile work environment; that the Company lacks sufficient internal
controls, and that the individual was the victim of retaliation and constructive discharge after being removed as a director by
majority vote of the shareholders. The claims were investigated by a newly appointed Special Investigative Committee made up of
independent directors represented by special independent legal counsel. The Special Investigative Committee and legal counsel found
the material claims were unsubstantiated, including those concerning alleged SEC violations, and recommended enhancements to certain
corporate governance charter documents and processes which the Company promptly implemented. The Parties participated in a
successful mediation at the end of June 2022 and all matters relating to this former employee/claimant were confidentially resolved
with the lawsuit dismissed with prejudice (Order pending). The settlement was covered by our Employment Practices Liability Policy
and did not amount to a material amount. On February 10, 2022, AMMO filed a Texas state court complaint against Expansion Industries
pursing eight (8) claims in pursuit of recovery of AMMO’s in primer acquisition deposit monies (i.e., Breach of Contract,
Common Law Fraud, Violations of Texas Theft Liability Act, Conversion, Negligent Misrepresentation, Unjust Enrichment, Money Had and
Received and Constructive Trust). AMMO has since moved aggressively to further the process, including successfully garnishing a
portion of the deposit monies in Expansion bank accounts, filing a Motion for Summary Judgement, continuing to pursue written
discovery, and amending the Complaint to add Expansion principal as an individual party. The putative primer manufacturer settled
the two related lawsuits in September 2022 by repaying all deposit monies due AMMO, in addition to payment of principally all fees
and costs incurred by the Company in pursuit of the resolution. The principal lawsuit and AMMO’s garnishment action adverse
the defendant were dismissed with prejudice. Along with countless other suppliers of Remington Outdoors, AMMO was served with an
avoidance claim lawsuit by the bankruptcy trustee. AMMO presented substantial “ordinary course” defense evidence to the
Trustee and the case was settled for a nominal sum in September 2022, with the lawsuit dismissed with prejudice. AMMO is defending
two contract arbitration cases involving adverse former employees that are presently in discovery, one involving an employee
terminated for cause and the second action involving a termination without cause wherein the former employee is seeking contract
wages, commissions and allegedly earned common stock.
The
Company also received notice in October that an OSHA whistleblower complaint had been filed with the US Department of Labor by an
employee that had been terminated for cause. The regulatory filing was received after AMMO refused to capitulate to the former
employee’s demands. AMMO has produced documents and submitted its position statement to OSHA and the matter is currently
pending at the agency level. There were no other known contingencies at December 31, 2022.

property and equipment, we remove the cost of the disposed assets and related accumulated depreciation from the accounts and any resulting
gain or loss is credited or charged to other income. We charge expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance to expense as incurred.
We
capitalize additions and expenditures for improving or rebuilding existing assets that extend the useful life. Leasehold improvements
made either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease

CONSTRUCTION NOTE PAYABLE
On
October 14, 2021, we entered into a Construction Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Hiawatha National Bank (“Hiawatha”).
The Loan Agreement specifies that Hiawatha may lend up to $ 11,625,000
to the Borrower to pay a portion of the construction costs of an
approximately
160,000
square foot manufacturing facility to be constructed on our property (the “Loan”). The first advance
of Loan funds by Hiawatha was made on October 14, 2021 in the amount of $ 329,843 . We expect to receive further advances of Loan funds
approximately every month as our “owner’s equity” is fully funded into the ongoing new plant construction project.
The Loan is an advancing term loan and not a revolving loan so any portion of the principal repaid cannot be reborrowed.
Additionally,
on October 14, 2021, we issued a Promissory Note in favor of Hiawatha (the “Note”) in the amount of up to $ 11,625,000
with
an interest rate of four and one-half percent ( 4.5 % ). The maturity date of the Note is
October 14, 2026 .
We
can prepay the Note in whole or in part starting in July 2022 with a prepayment premium of one percent ( 1 % ) of the principal being prepaid.
The
Loan Agreement contains customary events of default including, but not limited to, a failure to make any payments pursuant to the Loan
Agreement or Note, a failure to complete construction of the project, a lien of $100,000 or more against the property, or a transfer
of the property without Hiawatha’s consent. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, among other remedies, the amounts due pursuant
to the Loan can be accelerated, Hiawatha can foreclose on the property pursuant to the mortgage, and a late charge of five percent (5%)
of the amount due will be owed with all amounts then owed pursuant to the Note bearing interest at an increased rate .
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately $ 11.2
million of Loan funds were advanced including $ 1.0
million of cash collateral
or restricted cash as security for the Loan. We made $ 66,585
in principal payments for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022.
The restricted cash can be released per the terms documented in the Loan Agreement filed with the Commission on Form 10-Q on February
14, 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, $ 500,000

ACQUISITION
Gemini
Direct Investments, LLC
On
April 30, 2021 (the “Effective Date”) we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”),
by and among the Company, SpeedLight Group I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
(“Sub”), Gemini Direct Investments, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Gemini”), and Steven F. Urvan,
an individual (the “Seller”), whereby Sub merged with and into Gemini, with Sub surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company (the “Merger”). At the time of the Merger, Gemini had nine (9) subsidiaries, all of which are related to Gemini’s
ownership of the GunBroker.com business. GunBroker.com is an on-line auction marketplace dedicated to firearms, hunting, shooting, and
related products. The Merger was completed on the Effective Date.
In
consideration of the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, on the Effective Date, (i)
the Company assumed and repaid an aggregate amount of indebtedness of Gemini and its subsidiaries equal to $ 50,000,000
(the “Assumed
Indebtedness”); and, (ii) the issued and outstanding membership interests in Gemini (the “Membership Interests”), held
by the Seller, automatically converted into the right to receive (A) $ 50,000,000
(the “Cash Consideration”), and (B)
20,000,000
shares of common stock of the Company, $ 0.001
par value per share (the “Stock Consideration”).
In
connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company and the Seller agreed that the Stock Consideration consisted of: (a)
14,500,000
shares
issued without being held in escrow or requiring prior stockholder approval; (b)
4,000,000
shares issued subject to the Pledge and Escrow
Agreement; and (c)
1,500,000
shares that will not be issued prior to the Company obtaining stockholder approval for the issuance (the
“Additional Securities”).
The
total estimated consideration consisted of cash payment of $ 50,000,000
less $ 1,350,046
of acquired cash, a working capital adjustment
of $ 2,000,000 , debt assumption and repayment upon closing of $ 50,000,000 , contingent consideration of $ 10,755,000
for
1,500,000
Additional
Securities, and
18,500,000
shares of AMMO Inc. Common Stock. The shares were valued at $ 7.17
per share, the five-day average closing
price of the Company’s Common Stock immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement.
Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, the Company completed a Post-Closing Adjustment following the close of the Merger equal to the Closing Working
Capital minus the Estimated Working Capital at closing of the Merger. Accordingly, the Company received a cash payment of $ 129,114
and
adjusted the $ 2,000,000
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment in the fair value of the consideration transferred to $ 1,870,886 .
In
accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed have

SEGMENTS
On
April 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Gemini, which, along with its subsidiaries, engages primarily in
the operation of an online marketplace dedicated to firearms, hunting, shooting and related products, which created a second reportable
segment. Our Chief Executive Officer reviews financial performance based on our two operating segments as follows:
●
Ammunition
– which consists of our manufacturing business. The Ammunition segment engages in the design, production and marketing of ammunition
and ammunition component products.
●
Marketplace
– which consists of the GunBroker.com marketplace. In its role as an auction site, GunBroker.com supports the lawful sale of
firearms, ammunition and hunting/shooting accessories.
In
the current period, we began the reporting of the separate allocation of certain corporate general and administrative expenses including

14.9 %
and
482.1 %
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022,
13.0 %
and
4.0 %
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the effective
tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes. For the three and nine months ended December
31, 2021 the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to our valuation. The effective tax rates increased
during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period due to the removal of our valuation allowance.
The
Company has never had an Internal Revenue Service audit; therefore, the tax periods ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and March

Settlement
Agreement
On
November 3, 2022, AMMO, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”)
with Steven F. Urvan and Susan T. Lokey (collectively with each of their respective affiliates and associates, the “Urvan Group”).
Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, the Urvan Group has agreed to withdraw its notice of stockholder nomination of its seven director candidates
(the “Urvan Candidates”) and its demand to inspect books and records, pursuant to Section 220 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, and the Company agreed to immediately increase the size of the Board from seven to nine directors and appoint
Christos Tsentas and Wayne Walker (each, a “New Director” and the New Directors together with Mr. Urvan, the “Urvan
Group Directors”) to the Board to serve as directors with terms expiring at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2022
Annual Meeting”). The Company will include the Urvan Group Directors in its director candidates slate for the 2022 Annual Meeting
and any subsequent annual meeting of stockholders of the Company occurring prior to the Termination Date (as defined below). The Company
has agreed to not increase the size of the Board above nine directors prior to the Termination Date unless the increase is approved by
at least seven directors. Mr. Wagenhals will continue to serve as a director and Chairman of the Board.
Unless otherwise mutually agreed to in writing by each party, the Settlement
Agreement will remain in effect until the date that is the earlier of (i) 30 days prior to the earlier of (A) the deadline set forth in
the notice requirements of Federal “Universal Proxy Rules” promulgated under Rule 14a-19(a) and Rule 14a-19(b) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “UPR Deadline”) relating to the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders
(the “2023 Annual Meeting”) and (B) any deadline that may be set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (as amended from time to time, the “Certificate”) or Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) following the execution
of the Settlement Agreement relating to the nomination of director candidates for election to the Board at the 2023 Annual Meeting, and
(ii) 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2022 Annual Meeting (such date, the “Termination Date”). However, if the
Company notifies Mr. Urvan in writing at least 15 days prior to such Termination Date that the Board irrevocably offers to re-nominate
the Urvan Group Directors for election at the 2023 Annual Meeting and Mr. Urvan accepts such offer within 15 days of receipt of such notice,
the Termination Date will be automatically extended until the earlier of (i) 30 days prior to the earlier of (A) the UPR Deadline relating
to the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2024 Annual Meeting”) and (B) any deadline that may be set
forth in the Certificate or the Bylaws following execution of the Settlement Agreement relating to the nomination of director candidates
for election to the Board at the 2024 Annual Meeting, and (ii) 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2023 Annual Meeting. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the “Termination Date” shall not occur prior to 20 days after Mr. Urvan’s departure from the Board.
Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, the Company will suspend the previously announced separation of Company into Action Outdoor Sports,
Inc. and Outdoor Online, Inc., pending the further evaluation of strategic options by the Board. The Company paid approximately
$ 500,000
of
the Urvan Group’s costs, fees and expenses per the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Additionally, the Company issued

equipment, outdoor gear, collectibles, and much more on our site, while facilitating compliance with federal and state laws that
govern the sale of firearms and restricted items. This allows our base of over 7.6 million users to follow ownership policies and
regulations through our network of over 35,000 federally licensed firearms dealers as transfer agents. The nature and operation of
the Marketplace as an online auction and sales platform also affords our Company a unique view into the total domestic market for
the purpose of understanding sales trends at a granular level across all elements of the outdoor sports and shooting space. Our
vision is to expand the services on GunBroker.com and to become a peer to those in our industry. In the short term, we will be
implementing the following services;
● Payment Processing - facilitating
payment between parties allowing sellers of all sizes to offer fast and secure electronic payments and allowing buyers to experience the
ease of using a single form of payment for all items purchased,
● Carting Ability - allowing our buyers
to purchase multiple items from multiple sellers at one point in time, and
● GunBroker.com Analytics –
through the compilation and refinement of vast Marketplace data, we plan to offer domestic market analytics to our industry peers to allow
them to better manage their businesses.
Through our Ammunition
segment, we are tailoring our focus to build a new future for our manufacturing operations focused on premium pistol and rifle ammunition
and supporting industry partners for manufactured components. We will continue to leverage our proprietary brands like Streak Visual
Ammunition TM
and Stelth subsonic ammunition and extend our product offering with premium rifle lines and brands that complement
our technologically innovative heritage. We also continue to ensure dynamic performance under the exacting standards of the US military
complex in support of our cutting-edge developmental ammunition programs as we seek out and effectively execute upon new governmental-based
opportunities.
25
In September of 2022, we began operating out of our
new 185,000 square foot manufacturing facility. This new, state-of-the-art ammunition production facility is part of our commitment to
the continuing development of differentiated, cutting-edge technology.
Results
of Operations
Our
financial results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 reflect our newly positioned organization as we transition into
our new manufacturing facility. We believe that we have hired a strong team of professionals, developed innovative products, and continue
to raise capital sufficient to establish our presence as a high-quality ammunition provider and marketplace. We continue to focus on
growing our top line revenue and streamlining our operations. We experienced a 13.2% decrease in our Net Revenues for
the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This was the result of decreased ammunition sales due to changes in market demand.
The
following table presents summarized financial information taken from our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three
and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared with the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021:

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
We
analyze operational and financial data to evaluate our business, allocate our resources, and assess our performance. In addition to total
net sales, net loss, and other results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the
following information includes key operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our business. We believe these
measures are useful for period-to-period comparisons of the Company. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q because they are key measures we use to evaluate our operational performance, produce future strategies for our operations,
and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of our resources. Accordingly, we believe
these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner
as our management and board of directors.

Adjusted
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that displays our net income (loss), adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as described
below.
We
have excluded the following non-cash expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures: provision or benefit for income taxes,
depreciation and amortization, share-based or warrant-based compensation expenses, and changes to the contingent consideration fair
value. We believe it is useful to exclude these non-cash expenses because the
amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business
operations.
Adjusted
EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure also excludes other cash interest income and expense, and non-recurring expenses incurred as
a result of a proxy contest as these items are not components of our core operations.
We
have modified our Adjusted EBITDA calculation in the current period to remove the adjustment for Excise Taxes as we believe this is a
better representation of our operations. In prior periods, we included an adjustment for Excise Taxes.
Non-GAAP
financial measures have limitations, should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant as a substitute for the related
financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:
●
Employee
stock awards and stock grants expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense
in the Company and an important part of our compensation strategy;
●
the
assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect cash
capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or other capital commitments; and
●
non-GAAP
measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs
●
other
companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces
their usefulness as comparative measures.
Because
of these limitations, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including our
net loss and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.
Net
Sales
The
following table shows our net sales by proprietary ammunition versus standard ammunition for the three and nine months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021. “Proprietary Ammunition” include those lines of ammunition manufactured by our facilities that are sold
under the brand names: STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ and Stelth. We define “Standard Ammunition” as non-proprietary ammunition
that directly competes with other brand manufacturers. Our “Standard Ammunition” is manufactured within our facility and
may also include completed ammunition that has been acquired in the open market for sale to others. Also included in this category is
low cost target pistol and rifle ammunition, as well as bulk packaged ammunition manufactured by us using reprocessed brass casings.
Ammunition within this product line typically carries lower gross margins.

Sales
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased 40% and 13%, respectively, or approximately $26 million and $22.4 million,
over the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 due to changes in market conditions. The decrease for the three month period
was largely the result of a decrease of $22.1 million in sales of bulk pistol and rifle ammunition, a decrease of $1.7 million of sales
of Proprietary Ammunition, and a decrease of $2.2 million generated from our marketplace, GunBroker.com, which includes auction revenue,
payment processing revenue, and shipping income. The decrease for the nine month period was the result of an increase of approximately
$2.0 million of sales of Proprietary Ammunition, a decrease of $24.1 million of sales in bulk pistol and rifle ammunition, and a decrease
of approximately and $0.2 million of sales from our casing operations. Management expects the sales growth rate of Proprietary Ammunition
to greatly outpace the sales of our Standard Ammunition.
We
are focused on continuing to grow top line revenue quarter-over-quarter as we continue to further expand distribution into commercial
markets, introduce new product lines, and continue to initiate sales to U.S. law enforcement, military, and international markets.
Through
our acquisition of SWK, the Company has developed and deployed a line of tactical armor piercing (AP) and hard armor piercing incendiary
(HAPI) precision ammunition to meet the lethality requirements of both the US and foreign military customers.
We continue to demonstrate our AP and HAPI ammunition to military personnel at scheduled and invite only events, resulting in increased
interest and procurement discussions. The Company has since developed the ballistic match (BMMPR) and signature-on-target (SoT) rounds
under contract with the U.S. Government in support of US special operations which have been publicly announced pursuant to governmental
authorization. Additional work continues in support of the military operations of the U.S. and its ally military components which is
not currently subject to disclosure.
It
is important to note that, although U.S. law enforcement, military and international markets represent significant opportunities for
our Company, they also have a long sales cycle. The Company’s sales team has been effective in establishing sales and distribution
channels, both in the United States and abroad, which are reasonably anticipated to drive sustained sales opportunity in the military,
law enforcement, and commercial markets.
Sales
outside of the United States require licenses and approval from either the U.S. Department of Commerce or the U.S. State Department,
which typically takes approximately 30 days to receive. On June 16, 2022, we renewed our annual registration with the International Traffic
in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), which remains valid through the report date. This permits the Company to export and broker
ammunition and other controlled items covered under ITAR.
Cost
of Revenues
Cost
of Revenues decreased by approximately $16 million and increased $1.8 million from $42.2 million and $102.5 million to $26.2 million
and $104.3 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the comparable period ended in 2021. This was the
result of a significant decrease in net sales as well increases to non-cash depreciation related to increases in production equipment,
expensing of increased labor, overhead, and raw materials used to produce finished product during 2022 as compared to 2021.
Gross
Margin
Our
gross margin percentage decreased to 32.4% and 29.4% from 34.8% and 39.8% during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively,
as compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease in our gross margin was related to increased costs of raw materials, labor, and
overhead costs.
28
We
believe as we continue to grow sales through new markets and expanded distribution that our gross margins will also increase by efficiencies
added through our new production facility. Our goal in the next 12 to 24 months is to continue
to improve our gross margins. This will be accomplished through the following:
●
Increased
product sales, specifically of proprietary lines of ammunition, like the STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™, Stelth and now our tactical
Armor Piercing (AP) and Hard Armor Piercing Incendiary (HAPI) precision ammunition, all of which carry higher margins as a percentage
of their selling price;
●
Introduction
of new lines of ammunition that historically carry higher margins in the consumer and government sectors;
●
Reduced
component costs through operation of our ammunition segment and expansion of strategic relationships with component providers;
●
Expanded
use of automation equipment that reduces the total labor required to assemble finished products;
●
And
better leverage of our fixed costs through expanded production to support the sales objectives.
Operating
Expenses
Overall,
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, our operating expenses increased by approximately $4.9 million and $10 million
over the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 and increased as a percentage of sales from 18.4% and 19.5% for the three and
nine months ended December 31, 2021 to 43.6% and 29.3% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. Our operating expenses
include non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3.3 million and $9.9 million for the three and nine months ended
December 31, 2022, respectively. Our operating expenses consisted of commissions related to our sales, stock compensation expense associated
with issuance of our Common Stock in lieu of cash compensation for employees, board members, and key consultants for the organization
during the period. Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 included noncash expenses of approximately
$6.6 million and $19.0 million, respectively.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our selling and marketing expenses decreased by approximately $0.5 million, while for the
nine months ended December 31, 2022 our selling and marketing expenses decreased by approximately $0.2 million, in comparison to the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily related to decreases in sales commission due to the
decrease in the sale of our products resulting of approximately $2.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Our
corporate general & administrative expenses increased approximately $4.1 million and $7.0 million in the three and nine months ended
December 31, 2022 from the comparable prior period due to $3.3 million and $4.0 million of respective legal and professional fees and
expenses largely related to our proxy contest in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022.The increase was also partly due
to inclusion of the full nine months of Gemini expenses for the nine month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to partial inclusion
during the period ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the acquisition occurring on April 30, 2021.
Employee
salaries and related expenses increased approximately $1.8 million and $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended December 31,
2022 compared to the comparable period ended in 2021. The increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the
prior period, was primary related to $1.2 million of additional payroll expenses incurred in the three months ended December 31,
2022 as a result of payments due upon termination without cause as a result of the proxy contest and as well as $1.5 million in
additional stock compensation expenses.
Depreciation
and amortization expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $0.4 million, and decreased for the
nine months ended December 31, 2022 by approximately $0.1 million.
Interest
and Other Expenses
For
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, interest expense increased by approximately $0.3 million and $0.1 million compared
with the comparable three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The change from the prior periods was mainly due to the repayment
of notes during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Income
Taxes
For
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a provision for federal and state income taxes of approximately ($0.7)
million and $1.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a provision for federal and
state income taxes of approximately $1.4 million, respectively.
Net
Income
We
ended the three months ended December 31, 2022 with a net loss of approximately $4 million compared with a net income of approximately
$9.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. We ended the nine months ended December 31, 2022 with a net loss of approximately
$1.6 million compared with a net income of approximately $32.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
29
Our
goal is to continue to improve our operating results as we focus on increasing sales and controlling our operating expenses.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2022, we had $27,093,614 of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $3,812,139 from March 31, 2022.

Changes
in cash flows are summarized as follows:
Operating
Activities
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operations totaled approximately $18.4 million. This was primarily the
result of net loss of approximately $1.7 million, which was offset by decreases in our accounts receivable of approximately $12.2 million,
decreases in prepaid expenses of approximately $1.9 million, and decreases in our accounts payable of approximately $5.8 million, increases
in our inventories of approximately $8.1 million, and decreases in deposits of approximately $1.7 million. Non-cash expenses for depreciation
and amortization totaled approximately $13.0 million and non-cash expenses for employee stock awards totaled $4.5 million.
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operations totaled approximately $3.6 million. This was primarily the result
of net income of approximately $32.7 million, which was offset by increases in our inventories of approximately $30.1 million, increases
in deposits of approximately $13.1 million, increases in our accounts receivable of approximately $20.7 million, decreases in prepaid
expenses of approximately $1.6 million, and increases in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $7.5 million and $1.3 million,
respectively. Non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization totaled approximately $12.8 million and non-cash expenses for employee
stock awards totaled $2.9 million.
Investing
Activities
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we used approximately $10.6 million in net cash for investing activities. Net cash used in investing
activities consisted of approximately $9.3 million related to purchases of production equipment and the construction of our new manufacturing
facility in Manitowoc, WI.
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we used approximately $63.3 million in net cash for investing activities. Net cash used in investing
activities consisted of approximately $50.5 million used in connection with the merger of Gemini, and approximately $12.9 million related
to purchases of production equipment and the construction of our new manufacturing facility in Manitowoc, WI.
Financing
Activities
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was approximately $3.6 million. This was the net effect
of an approximate $0.8 million reduction in our Inventory Credit Facility, approximately $1.9 million from insurance premium note payments,
approximately $2.2 million of Preferred Stock dividends paid, generation of approximately $57.3 million from accounts receivable factoring,
which was offset by payments of approximately $56.1 million, and proceeds from our Construction Note Payable of $1.0 million.
30
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was approximately $24.0 million. This was the net effect
of a $50.0 million payment on debt assumed from Gemini, $35.0 million of proceeds from the sale of our preferred stock net of approximately
$3.2 million of issuance costs, approximately $0.9 million was generated from common stock issued for exercised warrants, the $4.0 million
repayment of a note payable, and an approximate $0.9 million reduction in our Inventory Credit Facility. Additionally, approximately
$86.5 million was generated from accounts receivable factoring, which was offset by payments of approximately $84.2 million.
Liquidity
Existing
working capital, cash flow from operations, bank borrowings, and sales of equity and debt securities are expected to be adequate to fund
our operations over the next year. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of stock sales, bank financings,
and related-party notes. These sources have been adequate to fund our recurring cash expenditures including but not limited to our working
capital requirements, capital expenditures to expand our operations, debt repayments, and acquisitions. We intend to continue use the
aforementioned sources of funding for capital expenditures, debt repayments, share repurchases and any potential acquisitions.
Leases
We
lease four locations that are used for our offices, production, and warehousing. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.8 million of fixed
lease payment obligations with $.6 million payable within the next 12 months. Please refer to Note 8– Leases for additional information.
Related
Party Note Payable
As
of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance on our Related Party Note Payable of approximately $0.4 million, which is due within
the next 12 months.
Construction
Note Payable
We
will finance a portion of our new production facility with our Construction Note Payable. We expect to make $0.3 million in principal
and interest payments within the next 12 months. The principal balance of the Construction Note will mature on October 14, 2026.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
As
of December 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
material effect on our financial condition, net sales, expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures, or capital resources.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
made in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements include the valuation of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation
of deferred tax assets, inventories, useful lives of assets, goodwill, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and warrant-based compensation. A summary of
our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, under “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” There have been no significant changes to these policies
during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. For disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated
impact they will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022.
Goodwill
We
evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize
a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test.
We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value
of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more
likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the
estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.
Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected
category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Due to the declines in the value of our stock price
and market capitalization, we assessed qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Marketplace
segment is less than its carrying amount. Through our analysis we determined our stock price and market capitalization decline it is
not indicative of a decrease in the the fair value of our Marketplace segment and a fair value calculation using the discounted cash
flows was more appropriate due to the operational performance of the reporting segment. Accordingly, the impairment of Goodwill was not
warranted for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a goodwill carrying value of
$90,870,094, all of which is assigned to the Marketplace segment. However, due to declines in the value of the Company’s common
stock and market capitalization, it is possible that the book values of our Marketplace segment could exceed its fair value, which may
result in the recognition of a material, noncash impairment of goodwill for the year ending March 31, 2023.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls
and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Our controls were ineffective due to the size of the Company and available resources. There are limited personnel to assist with the
accounting and financial reporting function, which results in: (i) a lack of segregation of duties and (ii) controls that may not be
adequately designed or operating effectively. Despite the existence of material weaknesses, the Company believes the financial information
presented herein is materially correct and fairly presents the financial position and operating results of the three months ended December
31, 2022, in accordance with GAAP.
Changes
in internal controls
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, during
the quarterly period from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We
are involved in or subject to, or may become involved in or subject to, routine litigation, claims, disputes, proceedings, and investigations
in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty,
in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits are expected to have a material effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. We record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred
