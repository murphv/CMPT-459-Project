Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   1.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes of Tetra Tech, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or "Tetra Tech") have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. These financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations and cash flows for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year or for future fiscal yea rs. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 2.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model by analogy, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity's financial statements. ASU 2021-10 was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2020, the Canadian federal government implemented the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy ("CEWS") program in response to the negative impact of the
coronavirus disease 2019 (" COVID-19") pandemic on businesses operating in Canada. Our Canadian legal entities qualified for and applied for these CEWS cash benefits to partially offset the impacts of revenue reductions and on-going staffing costs. The $ 26.0  million total received was initially recorded in "Other current liabilities" until all potential amendments to the qualification criteria, including some that were proposed with retroactive application, were finalized in fiscal 2022. As there are no further contingencies, beginning in fiscal 2023, the amounts received will be distributed to all Canadian employees. We expect to distribute approximately $ 9  million in the next twelve months. Accordingly, this amount was reclassified from "Other current liabilities" to "Accrued compensation" on our consolidated balance sheet at October 2, 2022. The remaining $ 17.0  million, which we expect to distribute beyond one year, was reclassified to "Other non-current liabilities". We do not expect there will be any related impact to our operating income, and we have no outstanding applications for further government assistance. 3.
Revenue and Contract Balances
We disaggregate revenue by client sector and contract type, as we believe it best depicts how the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
The following tables present revenue disaggregated by client sector and contract type (in thousands): 8   Three Months Ended   January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022   Client Sector:     U.S. federal government
(1) $ 276,075   $ 266,797   U.S. state and local government 153,195   159,008   U.S. commercial 198,956   176,904   International
(2) 266,540   255,801   Total $ 894,766   $ 858,510   Contract Type: Fixed-price $ 327,737   $ 331,248   Time-and-materials 420,570   395,648   Cost-plus 146,459   131,614   Total $ 894,766   $ 858,510   (1)     Includes revenue generated under U.S. federal government contracts performed outside the United States. (2)     Includes revenue generated from foreign operations, primarily in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and revenue generated from non-U.S. clients. Other than the U.S. federal government, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the three months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022.
Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities We invoice customers based on the contractual terms of each contract. However, the timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoice issuance.
Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of the amounts for which we have the contractual right to bill our customers. Such amounts are recoverable from customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones or completion of a contract. In addition, many of our time and materials arrangements are billed in arrears pursuant to contract terms that are standard within the industry, resulting in contract assets and/or unbilled receivables being recorded, as revenue is recognized in advance of billings. Contract retentions, included in contract assets, represent amounts withheld by clients until certain conditions are met or the project is completed, which may extend beyond one year.
Contract liabilities consist of billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities decrease as we recognize revenue from the satisfaction of the related performance obligation and increase as billings in advance of revenue recognition occur. Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. There were no substantial non-current contract assets or liabilities for the periods presented.
Net contract assets/liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands): Balance at January 1, 2023 October 2, 2022 Contract assets
(1) $ 80,903   $ 92,405   Contract liabilities 274,118   241,340   Net contract liabilities $ ( 193,215 ) $ ( 148,935 ) (1)     Inclu des $ 17.2
million and $ 23.3
million of contract retentions at January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively.
In the first quarters of fiscal
2023
and
2022 , we recognized revenue of approximately $ 81  million and $ 63  million, respectively, from amounts included in the contract liability balances at the end of fiscal
2022
and 20 21, respectively. We recognize revenue primarily using the cost-to-cost measure of progress method to estimate progress towards completion. Changes in those estimates could result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception-to-date revenue, costs and profit in the period in which such changes are made.
As a result, we recognized net
9 favorable revenue and operating income adjustments of $ 3.5  million and $ 2.8  million in the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
C hanges in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a projected loss, determined at the contract level, which would be recorded immediate ly in earnings. At January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for anticipated losses of $ 7.6
million and $ 10.0
million, respectively. The estimated cost to complete these related contracts at January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 was approximately $ 55
million and $ 80
million, respectively. Accounts Receivable, Net Net accounts receivable consisted of the following (in thousands): Balance at   January 1, 2023 October 2, 2022 Billed $ 486,027   $ 491,700   Unbilled 313,782   267,161   Total accounts receivable 799,809   758,861   Allowance for doubtful accounts ( 3,937 ) ( 3,749 ) Total accounts receivable, net $ 795,872   $ 755,112   Billed accounts receivable represent amounts billed to clients that have not been collected. Unbilled accounts receivable, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized but not yet billed pursuant to contract terms or billed after the period end date. Substantially all of our unbilled receivables at January 1, 2023 are expected to be billed and collecte d within
12
months.
The allowance for doubtful accounts represents amounts that are expected to become uncollectible or unrealizable in the future. We determine an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts based on management's consideration of trends in the actual and forecasted credit quality of our clients, including delinquency and payment history; type of client, such as a government agency or a commercial sector client; and general economic and industry conditions.
Claims are amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that we seek to collect from our clients or other third parties for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of unanticipated additional costs.
There were
no
claims included in our total accounts receivable at January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.
We regularly evaluate all unsettled claim amounts and record appropriate adjustments to revenue when it is probable that the claim will result in a different contract value than the amount previously estimated.
In the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded
no
gains or losses related to claims.
Other than the U.S. federal government, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable at January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022. Remaining Unsatisfied Performance Obligations (“RUPO”) Our RUPO represents a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. We h ad $ 3.8
billion of RUPO at January 1, 2023. RUPO increases with awards from new contracts or additions on existing contracts and decreases as work is performed and revenue is recognized on existing contracts. RUPO may also decrease when projects are canceled or modified in scope. We include a contract within our RUPO when the contract is awarded and an agreement on contract terms has been reached. We expect to satisfy our RUPO at January 1, 2023 over the following periods (in thousands):
Amount Within 12 months $ 2,460,171   Beyond
1,329,949   Total
$ 3,790,120   10 Although RUPO reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur. RUPO is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate. Our operations and maintenance contracts can generally be terminated by the clients without a substantive financial penalty. Therefore, the remaining performance obligations on such contracts are limited to the notice period required for the termination (usually
30 ,
60 , or
90
days). 4.              Acquisitions
Subsequent Event.
O n January 3, 2023, we acquired Amyx, Inc. (“Amyx”), an enterprise technology services, cybersecurity and management consulting firm. Based in Reston, Virginia, Amyx, with over
500
employees, provides application modernization, cybersecurity, systems engineering, financial management, and program management support on over
30
Federal Government programs. Amyx will be included in our GSG segment.
Subsequent Event.
On September 23, 2022, we made an all cash offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of RPS Group plc ("RPS"), a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange for 222 pence per share, through a scheme of arrangement, which was unanimously recommended by RPS's Board of Directors. On November 3, 2022, RPS's shareholders approved the scheme of arrangement.
On January 19, 2023, the court sanctioned scheme of arrangement to purchase RPS was approved, and we completed the acquisition on January 23, 202 3. The total purchase price including assumed debt and transactions costs was approximately GBP
714  million. RPS employs approximately
5,000
associates in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia Pacific and North America, delivering high-end solutions, especially in energy transformation, water and program management for government and commercial clients. Substantially all of RPS will be included in our CIG segment.
T he results of these acquisitions will be included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective closing dates. We are in the process of performing procedures to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the acquisitions, and will include the preliminary purchase price allocation in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending April 2, 2023. See Note 14, "Credit Facility" for additional information regarding the financing of these acquisitions.
In fiscal 2022, we acquired The Integration Group of America ("TIGA"), Piteau Associates (“PAE”) and other financially immaterial acquisitions.
TIGA is based in Spring, Texas and is an industry leader in process automation and system integration solutions, including customized software and platform (SaaS/PaaS) applications, advanced data analytics, cloud data integration and platform virtualization. PAE is based in Vancouver, British Columbia and is a global leader in sustainable natural resource analytics including hydrologic numerical modeling and dewatering system design. PAE is part of our CIG segment, and TIGA and other immaterial acquisitions are part of our GSG segment. The total fair value of the purchase price for all
four
acquisitions was $ 88.3  million. This amount is comprised of $ 44.0  million in initial cash payments made to the sellers, $ 2.5  million of receivables (net) related to estimated post-closing adjustments for the net assets acquired, $ 15.5  million payable in a promissory note issued to the sellers along with related transaction expenses of the sellers (which were subsequently paid in July 2022), and $ 31.3  million for the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out obligations, with a maximum of $ 47.0  million, based upon the achievement of specified operating income targets in each of the
three
to
five years
following the acquisitions.
Goodwill additions resulting from fiscal 2022 business combinations are primarily attributable to the significant technical expertise residing in embedded workforces that are sought out by clients, long-term management experience, the industry reputations, and the synergies expected to arise after the acquisitions in the areas of data management, digitization, modeling, water, and natural resources. These acquired capabilities, when combined with our exis ting global consulting and engineering business, result in opportunities that allow us to provide services under contracts that could not have been pursued individually by either us or the acquired companies. The results of these acquisitions were included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective closing dates. These acquisitions were not considered material to our financial statements, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial statements. As a result, no pro forma information has been provided. Backlog and client relations intangible assets include the fair value of existing contracts and the underlying customer relationships with lives ranging from

three
to
five years . For detailed information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 5, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”.
Most of our acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out agreements, which are generally based on the achievement of future operating income thresholds. The contingent earn-out arrangements are based on our valuations of the acquired companies and reduce the risk of overpaying for acquisitions if the projected financial results are not achieved. The fair values of any earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, we estimate the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability in “Current contingent earn-out liabilities”
11 and “Non-current contingent earn-out liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets. We consider several factors when determining that contingent earn-out liabilities are part of the purchase price, including the following: (1) the valuation of our acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and material component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and (2) the former owners of acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than contingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of our other key employees. The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment termination. We measure our contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We use a probability-weighted discounted income approach as a valuation technique to convert future estimated cash flows to a single present value amount. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are operating income projections over the earn-out period (generally
three
to
five years ), and the probability outcome percentages we assign to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability, with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Any amount paid in excess of the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We review and re-assess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. Changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent earn-out liabilities related to the time component of the present value calculation are reported in interest expense. Adjustments to the estimated fair value related to changes in all other unobservable inputs are reported in operating income.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we evaluated our estimates for contingent consideration liabilities for the remaining earn-out periods for each individu al acquisition, which included a review of their financial results to-date, the status of ongoing projects in their RUPO, and the inventory of prospective new contract awards. In addition, we considered the potential impact of the global economic disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating income projections over the various earn-out peri ods. For the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we had no material adjustments to our contingent earn-out liabilities in operating income.
At January 1, 2023, there was a total potential maximum of $ 120.9
million of outstanding contingent consideration related to acquisitions. Of this amount, $ 69.0
million was estimated as the fair value and accrued on our consolidated balance sheet. 5.              Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment (in thousands):   GSG CIG Total Balance at October 2, 2022 $ 519,102   $ 591,310   $ 1,110,412   Translation adjustments 2,792   20,099   22,891   Balance at January 1, 2023 $ 521,894   $ 611,409   $ 1,133,303   The foreign currency translation adjustments resulted from our foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies that are different than our reporting currency.  These goodwill amounts are presented net of reductions from historical impairment adjustments.
The gross amounts
for GSG were $ 539.6  million and $ 536.8
million at January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively, excluding accumulated impairment of $ 17.7  million at each date. The gross amounts of goodwill for CIG were $ 732.9  million and $ 712.8
million at January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively, excluding accumulated impairment of $ 121.5  million at each date. We perform our annual goodwill impairment review at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter. Our most recent annual review at July 4, 2022 (i.e. the first day of our fourth quarter in fiscal 2022) indicated that we had
no
impairment of goodwill, and all of our reporting units had estimated fair values that were in excess of their carrying values, including goodwill. At July 4, 2022, and after the reallocation of goodwill on the first day of fiscal 2022, we had no reporting units that had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than
165 %.
We also regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential change in the recoverability of goodwill. We perform interim goodwill impairment reviews between our annual reviews if certain events and circumstances have occurred, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; an increase in the competitive environment; a change in management, key personnel, strategy or customers; negative or declining cash flows; or a decline in
12 actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods. Although we believe that our estimates of fair value for these reporting units are reasonable, if financial performance for these reporting units falls significantly below our expectations or market prices for similar business decline, the goodwill for these reporting units could become impaired.     The following table presents the gross amount and accumulated amortization of our acquired identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives included in “Intangible assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets ($ in thousands): Period Ended   January 1, 2023 October 2, 2022   Weighted- Average Remaining Life (in Years) Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Amount Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Amount   Client relations 5.4 $ 43,601   $ ( 23,081 ) $ 20,520   $ 41,676   $ ( 21,092 ) $ 20,584   Backlog 0.4 34,837   ( 33,033 ) 1,804   33,286   ( 29,990 ) 3,296   Trade names 3.5 13,656   ( 8,444 ) 5,212   12,711   ( 7,428 ) 5,283   Total   $ 92,094   $ ( 64,558 ) $ 27,536   $ 87,673   $ ( 58,510 ) $ 29,163   Amortization expense for the three

7.                                       Stock Repurchase and Dividends
13 On October 5, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we could repurchase up to $ 400
million of our common stock . We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. At January 1, 2023, we had a remaining balance of $ 347.8  million under our stock repurchase program.
The following table presents dividends declared and paid in the first three months of fiscal 2023 and 2022: Declare Date Dividend Paid Per Share Record Date Payment Date Dividend Paid (in thousands) November 7, 2022 $ 0.23   November 21, 2022 December 9, 2022 $ 12,186   November 15, 2021 $ 0.20   December 2, 2021 December 20, 2021 $ 10,793   Subsequent Event.
On January 30, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.23
per share payable on February 24, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 13, 2023. 8.                                       Leases
Our operating leases are primarily for corporate and project office spaces.
To a much lesser extent, we have operating leases for vehicles and equipment. Our operating leases have remaining lease terms of
one month
to
ten years , some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to
five years .
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in "Right-of-use assets, operating leases", "Short-term lease liabilities, operating leases" and "Long-term lease liabilities, operating leases" in the consolidated balance sheets. Our finance leases are primarily for certain information technology equipment , and are included in "Other non-current assets", "Other current liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets at January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.
Right-of-use ("ROU") assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, incremental borrowing rates are used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset at the commencement date also includes any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date and initial direct costs less lease incentives received. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The components of lease costs are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Operating lease cost $ 20,961   $ 21,751   Sublease income ( 32 ) ( 125 ) Total lease cost $ 20,929   $ 21,626   Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 16,493   $ 17,519   Financing cash flows for finance leases 1,316   945   Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 11,117   12,347   Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities $ 1,431   $ 1,349   14 Supplemental balance sheet and other information related to leases are as follows (in thousands): Balance at January 1, 2023 October 2, 2022 Operating leases: Right-of-use assets $ 182,500   $ 182,319   Lease liabilities: Current 55,809   57,865   Non-current 148,034   146,285   Total operating lease liabilities $ 203,843   $ 204,150   Finance leases: Other non-current assets $ 9,932   $ 9,564   Other current liabilities $ 4,582   $ 4,481   Other non-current liabilities $ 5,343   $ 4,745   Weighted-average remaining lease term: Operating leases 5

We recogniz e the fair value of our stock-based awards as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in which the award vests. Stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended January 1, 2023 was $ 7.2
million, compared to $ 5.8
million for the same period last year. Most of these amounts were included in selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we awarded
55,708
performance share units (“PSUs”) to our non-employee directors and executive officers at an estimated fair value of $ 204.00
per share on the award date. All PSUs are performance-based and vest, if at all, after the conclusion of the
three-year
performance period. The number of PSUs that ultimately vest is based
50 % on the growth in our diluted earnings per share and
50 % on our relative total shareholder return over the vesting period. Additionally, we awarded
98,305
restricted stock units
15 (“RSUs”) to our non-employee directors, executive officers and employees at a fair value of $ 156.52
per share on the award date. All executive officer and employee RSUs have time-based vesting over a
four-year
period, and the non-employee director RSUs vest after
one year .
10.                                  Earnings per Share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, less unvested restricted stock for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares for the period. Potential common shares include the weighted-average dilutive effects of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock using the treasury stock method. The following table presents the number of weighted-average shares used to compute basic and diluted EPS (in thousands, except per share data):   Three Months Ended   January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022   Net income attributable to Tetra Tech $ 116,706   $ 68,489   Weighted-average common shares outstanding – basic 53,069   53,937   Effect of dilutive stock options and unvested restricted stock 460   640   Weighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted 53,529   54,577   Earnings per share attributable to Tetra Tech:     Basic $ 2.20   $ 1.27   Diluted $ 2.18   $ 1.25   11.                                    Income Taxes
The effective tax rates for the first three months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were
24.5 % and
18.8 %, respectively. Income tax expense was reduced by $ 1.7  million and $ 4.5  million of excess tax benefits on share-based payments in the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits on share-based payments, our effective tax rates in the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were
25.7 % an d
24.1 %, r espectively.
At January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was
$ 10.8  million
and $ 10.6
million, respectively. These uncertain tax positions substantially relate to ongoing examinations. It is reasonably p ossible that these liabilities may decrease within the next 12 months as certain examinations are resolved. These liabilities represent our current estimates of the additional tax liabilities that we may be assessed when the related audits are concluded. If these audits are resolved in a manner more unfavorable than our current expectations, our additional tax liabilities could be materially higher than the amounts currently recorded resulting in additional tax expense. 12.
Reportable Segments
We manage our operations under
two
reportable segments. Our GSG reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. government clients (federal, state and local) and all activities with development agencies worldwide. Our CIG reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. commercial clients and international clients other than development agencies.
GSG provides high-end consulting and engineering services primarily to U.S. government clients (federal, state and local) and development agencies worldwide. GSG supports U.S. government civilian and defense agencies with services in water, environment, sustainable infrastructure, information technology, and disaster management. GSG also provides engineering design services for U.S. based federal and municipal clients, especially in water infrastructure, flood protection and solid waste. GSG also leads our support for development agencies worldwide, especially in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.
16 CIG primarily provides high-end consulting and engineering services to U.S. commercial clients, and international clients inclusive of the commercial and government sectors. CIG supports commercial clients across the Fortun e 500, renewable energy, industrial, high performance buildings, and aerospace markets. CIG also provides sustainable infrastructure and related environmental, engineering and project management services to commercial and local government clients
across Canada, in Asia Pacific (primarily Australia and New Zealand), the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil and Chile. Management evaluates th e performance of these reportable segments based upon their respective segment operating income before the effect of amortization expense related to acquisitions, and other unallocated corporate expenses. We account for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if they were to third parties; that is, by applying a negotiated fee onto the costs of the services performed. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
The following tables summarize financial information regarding our reportable segments (in thousands):   Three Months Ended   January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022   Revenue     GSG $ 471,067   $ 456,099   CIG 439,556   416,286   Elimination of inter-segment revenue ( 15,857 ) ( 13,875 ) Total revenue $ 894,766   $ 858,510   Income from operations     GSG $ 60,347   $ 51,179   CIG 50,108   45,308   Corporate

Fair Value Measurements
The fair value of long-term debt was determined using the present value of future cash flows based on the borrowing rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 measurement, as described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 ). The carrying value of our long-term debt approximated fair value at January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022. At January 1, 2023, we had bor rowing s of $ 240.6
million outstanding under our Amended Credit Agreement, which were used to fund business acquisitions, work ing capital needs, stock repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures and contingent earn-outs. 14.     Credit Facility 17 On October 26, 2022, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that provides for an additional $ 500  million senior secured term loan facility (the "New Term Loan Facility") increasing our total borrowing capacity to $ 1.55  billion.
Subsequent Event.
On January 23, 2023, we acquired RPS and drew the entire amount of the New Term Loan Facility to partially finance the RPS acquisition. The remaining purchase price was financed with existing cash on hand and borrowings under the existing Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The New Term Loan Facility is not subject to any amortization payments of principal and matures on the third anniversary of the RPS acquisition closing date. On February 18, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”) with a total borrowing capacity of $ 1.05  billion that will mature in February 2027. The Amended Credit Agreement is a $ 750  million senior secured,
five-year
facility that provides for a $ 250  million term loan facility (the “Amended Term Loan Facility”) and a $ 500  million revolving credit facility (the “Amended Revolving Credit Facility”). In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement includes a $ 300  million accordion feature that allows us to increase the Amended Credit Agreement to $ 1.05  billion subject to lender approval. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) refinance indebtedness under our Credit Agreement dated at July 30, 2018; (ii) finance open market repurchases of common stock, acquisitions, and cash dividends and distributions; and (iii) utilize the proceeds for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a reduction in the interest grid for meeting certain sustainability targets related to the (i) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the Company’s projects and operational sustainability initiatives and (ii) improvement of peoples’ lives as a result of
the Company’s projects that provide environmental, social and governance benefits. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility includes a $ 100  million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, a $ 20  million sublimit for swingline loans, and a $ 300  million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings and letters of credit. The entire Amended Term Loan Facility was drawn on February 18, 2022. The Amended Term Loan Facility is subject to quarterly amortization of principal at
5 % annually commencing June 30, 2022. We may borrow on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, at our option, at either (a) a benchmark rate plus a margin that ranges from
1.000 % to
1.875 % per annum, or (b) a base rate for loans in U.S. dollars (the highest of the U.S. federal funds rate plus
0.50 % per annum, the bank’s prime rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate plus
1.00 %,
plus a margin that ranges from
0 % to
0.875 % per annum. In each case, the applicable margin is based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, calculated quarterly. The Amended Term Loan Facility is subject to the same interest rate provisions. The Amended Credit Agreement expires on February 18, 2027, or earlier at our discretion upon payment in full of loans and other obligations. The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and restrictive covenants, and customary events of default. The financial covenants provide for a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of
3.25
to 1.00 (total funded debt/EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of
3.00
to 1.00 (EBITDA/Consolidated Interest Charges, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by first priority liens on (i) the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries, including those subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under the Amended Credit Agreement, and (ii) the accounts receivable, general intangibles and intercompany loans, and those of our subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers. 15.
Derivative Financial Instruments We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our variable rate debt. We also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that cash flows and earnings could adversely be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our hedging program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives that have been designated as cash flow hedges in our consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income, and in our consolidated statements of income for those derivatives designated as fair value hedges. Our derivative contracts are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We entered into a forward contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 to acquire GBP
714.0  million at a rate of
1.0852
for a total of USD
774.8  million that was integrated with our planned acquisition of RPS. This contract matured on December 30, 2022. On December 28, 2022, we entered into
an extension of the integrated forward contr act to acquire GBP
714.0  million at a rate of
1.086
for a total of USD
775.4  million, extending the maturity date to January 23, 2023, the closing date of the RPS
18 acquisition.
Although an effective economic hedge of our foreign exchange risk related to this transaction, the forward contract does not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the forward contract is marked-to-market with changes in fair value recogni zed in earnings each period. The intrinsic value of the forward contract was immaterial at inception as the GBP/USD spot and forward exchange rates were essentially the same. The fair value of the forward contract at October 2, 2022 was $ 19.9  million, and an unrealized gain of the same amount was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 results. The fair value of the forward contract at January 1, 2023 was $ 87.9  million, which is reported in the "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" on our consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2023. This resulted in an unrealized gain of $ 68.0  million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which was recognized in earnings and reported in the “Other non-operating income" on our consolidated income statement. The forward contract was settled on January 23, 2023, with a cumulative gain of approximately $ 109  million.
In fiscal 2018, we entere d into
five
interest rate swap agreements that we designated as cash flow hedges to fix the interest rate on the borrowings under our term loan facility. At January 1, 2023, the notional principal of our outstanding interest swap agreements was $ 196.9
million ($ 39.4
million each.) The interest rate swaps have a fixed interest rate of
2.79 % and expire in July 2023 for all
five
agreements. At January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, the fair values of the effective portion of our interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges before tax effect were unrealized gains of $ 2.3  million and $ 2.4  million, respectively, which were reported in "Other non-current assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the related loss of $ 0.1  million for the three months ended January 1, 2023, compared to the related gain of $ 2.7  million for the prior-year period, were recognized and reported on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We expect to reclassify a credit of $ 2.2
million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense within the next twelve months. There were no other derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. 16.
Reclassifications Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The accumulated balances and activities for the three months ended January 1, 2023 and
January 2, 2022
related to reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income are summarized as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended   Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Gain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   Balance at October 3, 2021 $ ( 115,634 ) $ ( 9,394 ) $ ( 125,028 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 686 ) 4,032   3,346   Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss Interest rate contracts, net of tax

Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to certain claims and lawsuits typically filed against the consulting and engineering profession, alleging primarily professional errors or omissions. We carry professional liability insurance, subject to certain deductibles and policy limits, against such claims. However, in some actions, parties are seeking damages that exceed our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured. While management does not believe that the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse
19 effect, individually or in aggregate, on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, management acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of these matters.
On July 15, 2019, following an initial January 14, 2019 filing, the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office filed an amended complaint in intervention in
three
qui tam actions filed against our subsidiary, Tetra Tech EC, Inc. ("TtEC"), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges False Claims Act violations and breach of contract related to TtEC's contracts to perform environmental remediation services at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California. TtEC disputes the claims and will defend this matter vigorously. We are currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any.

throughout our operations, with domain experts across multiple disciplines supported by our advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and digital technology solutions. Our ability to provide innovative and first-of-kind solutions is enhanced by partnerships with our forward-thinking clients. We are diverse, equitable, and inclusive, embracing the breadth of experience across our talented workforce worldwide with a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. We are disciplined in our business, and focused on delivering value to customers and high performance for our shareholders. In supporting our clients, we seek to add value and provide long-term sustainable consulting, engineering and technology
solutions. By combining ingenuity and practical experience, we
have helped to advance sustainability by managing water, protecting the environment, providing clean energy, restoring ecosystems and engineering green solutions for our cities and communities.
We derive income from fees for professional, technical, program management, and construction management services. As primarily a professional services company, we are labor-intensive rather than capital-intensive. Our revenue is driven by our ability to attract and retain qualified and productive employees, identify business opportunities, secure new and renew existing client contracts, provide outstanding services to our clients and execute projects successfully. We provide services to a diverse base of U.S. state and local government, U.S. federal government, U.S. commercial, and international clients. 21 The following table presents the percentage of our revenue by client sector:   Three Months Ended January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Client Sector     U.S. state and local government 17.1  % 18.5  % U.S. federal government

(2) 29.8  29.8  Total 100.0   % 100.0   % (1)     Includes revenue generated under U.S. federal government contracts performed outside the United States. (2)     Includes revenue generated from foreign operations, primarily in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and revenue generated from non-U.S. clients. We manage our operations under two reportable segments. Our Government Services Group ("GSG") reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. government clients (federal, state and local) and all activities with development agencies worldwide. Our Commercial/International Services Group ("CIG") reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. commercial clients and international clients other than development agencies.
Government Services Group ( “ GSG ” ).   GSG provides high-end consulting and engineering services primarily to U.S. government clients (federal, state and local) and development agencies worldwide. GSG supports U.S. government civilian and defense agencies with services in water, environment, sustainable infrastructure, information technology, and disaster management. GSG also provides engineering design services for U.S. based federal and municipal clients, especially in water infrastructure, flood protection and solid waste. GSG also leads our support for development agencies worldwide, especially in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.
Commercial/International Services Group ( “ CIG ” ).   CIG primarily provides high-end consulting and engineering services to U.S. commercial clients, and international clients inclusive of the commercial and government sectors. CIG supports commercial clients across the Fortun e 500, renewable energy, industrial, high performance buildings, and aerospace markets. CIG also provides sustainable infrastructure and related environmental, engineering and project management services to commercial and local government clients
across Canada, in Asia Pacific (primarily Australia and New Zealand), the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil and Chile. The following table presents the percentage of our revenue by reportable segment:   Three Months Ended   January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Reportable Segment     GSG 52.7  % 53.1  % CIG 49.1  48.5  Inter-segment elimination (1.8) (1.6) Total 100.0   % 100.0   % 22 Our services are performed under three principal types of contracts with our clients: fixed-price, time-and-materials, and cost-plus. The following table presents the percentage of our revenue by contract type:   Three Months Ended   January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Contract Type     Fixed-price 36.6  % 38.6  % Time-and-materials 47.0  46.1  Cost-plus 16.4  15.3  Total 100.0   % 100.0   % Under fixed-price contracts, clients agree to pay a specified price for our performance of the entire contract or a specified portion of the contract. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and paid for other expenses. Under cost-plus contracts, some of which are subject to a contract ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable cost s plus fees,
which may be fixed or performance-based. Profitability on these contracts is
driven by billable headcount and our cost control. We recognize revenue from contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of progress method to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize.
Changes in those estimates could result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception-to-date revenue, costs and profit in the period in which such changes are made. On a quarterly basis, we review and assess our revenue and cost estimates for each significant contract. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a projected loss that would be recorded immediately in earnings.
Other contract costs include professional compensation and related benefits, together with certain direct and indirect overhead costs such as rents, utilities, and travel. Professional compensation represents a large portion of these costs. Our "Selling, general and administrative expenses" ("SG&A") are comprised primarily of marketing and bid and proposal costs, and our corporate headquarters’ costs related to the executive offices, finance, accounting, administration, and information technology. Our SG&A expenses also include a portion of stock-based compensation and depreciation of property and equipment related to our corporate headquarters, and the amortization of identifiable intangible assets. Most of these costs are unrelated to specific clients or projects, and can vary as expenses are incurred to support company-wide activities and initiatives. We experience seasonal trends in our business.  Our revenue and operating income are typically lower in the first half of our fiscal year, primarily due to the Thanksgiving (in the U.S. and Canada), Christmas, and New Year’s holidays. Many of our clients’ employees, as well as our own employees, take vacations during these holiday periods. Further, seasonal inclement weather conditions occasionally cause some of our offices to close temporarily or may hamper our project field work in the northern hemisphere's temperate and arctic regions. These occurrences result in fewer billable hours worked on projects and, correspondingly, less revenue recognized. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Acquisitions.   We continuously evaluate the marketplace for acquisition opportunities to further our strategic growth plans. Due to our reputation, size, financial resources, geographic presence and range of services, we have numerous opportunities to acquire privately and publicly held companies or selected portions of such companies. We evaluate an acquisition opportunity based on its ability to strengthen our leadership in the markets we serve, the technologies and solutions they provide, and the additional new geographies and clients they bring. Also, during our evaluation, we examine an acquisition's ability to drive organic growth, its accretive effect on long-term earnings, and its ability to generate return on investment. Generally, we proceed with an acquisition if we believe that it will strategically expand our service offerings, improve our long-term financial performance, and increase shareholder returns. We view acquisitions as a key component in the execution of our growth strategy, and we intend to use cash, debt or equity, as we deem appropriate, to fund acquisitions. We may acquire other businesses that we believe are synergistic and will ultimately increase our revenue and net income, strengthen our ability to achieve our strategic goals, provide critical mass with existing clients and further expand our lines of service. We typically pay a purchase price that results in the recognition of goodwill, generally representing the intangible value of a successful business with an assembled workforce specialized in our areas of interest. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. All
23 acquisitions require the approval of our Board of Directors. For detailed information regarding acquisitions, see Note 4, “Acquisitions” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”. Divestitures.
We regularly review and evaluate our existing operations to determine whether our business model should change through the divestiture of certain businesses. Accordingly, from time to time, we may divest or wind-down certain non-core businesses and reallocate our resources to businesses that better align with our long-term strategic direction. OVERVIEW OF RESULTS AND BUSINESS TRENDS General.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, revenue increased 4.2% compared to the prior-year quarter.
This year-over-year growth reflects increased activity in all of our client sectors. U.S. Federal Government.
Our U.S. federal government revenue increased 3.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same quarter last year. This
increase was primarily due to more international development and environmental activities. During periods of economic volatility, our U.S. federal government business has historically been the most stable and predictable. We expect our U.S. federal government revenue to continue to grow in the remainder of fiscal 2023. Approximately $1 trillion in new U.S. federal funding passed in 2021 through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act. Each of these programs include substantial planned investments in our key end markets including water, environment and sustainable infrastructure over the next five to ten years. U.S. State and Local Government.
Our U.S. state and local government revenue decreased 3.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same quarter last year due to lower disaster response activity. Excluding disaster response, our state and local government revenue increased approximately
10%
in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to last year's first quarter.
The increase reflects continued broad-based growth in our U.S. state and local government infrastructure business, particularly with increased revenue from municipal water infrastructure work, including digital water projects. Most of our work for the U.S. state and local governments relates to critical water and environmental programs, which we expect to continue to grow in the remainder of fiscal 2023. U.S. Commercial.
Our U.S. commercial revenue increased 12.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same quarter last year.
This increase was primarily due to more activity on environmental and renewable energy programs, including meeting net zero carbon goals and designing high performance buildings. We expect growth in our U.S. commercial work to continue in the remainder of fiscal 2023. International.
Our international revenue increased 4.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same quarter last year despite the adverse impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and the adverse impact on our foreign currency translation year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, our international revenue increased approximately 14% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. This revenue growth reflec ts government stimulus spending on infrastructure and commercial activities related to an increased focus on sustainability. We expect growth in our international work to continue in the remainder of fiscal 2023.
Subsequent Events.
O n January 3, 2023, we acquired Amyx, Inc. (“Amyx”), an enterprise technology services, cybersecurity and management consulting firm. Based in Reston, Virginia, Amyx, with over 500 employees, provides application modernization, cybersecurity, systems engineering, financial management, and program management support on over 30 Federal Government programs. Amyx will be included in our GSG segment.
On September 23, 2022, we made an all cash offer to acquire all the outstanding shares of RPS Group plc ("RPS"), a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange for 222 pence per share, through a scheme of arrangement, which was unanimously recommended by RPS's Board of Directors. On November 3, 2022, RPS's shareholders approved the scheme of arrangement.
On January 19, 2023, the court sanctioned scheme of arrangement to purchase RPS was approved, and we completed the acquisition on January 23, 202 3. The total purchase price including assumed debt and transactions costs was approximately GBP 714 million. RPS employs approximately 5,000 associates in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia Pacific and North America, delivering high-end solutions, especially in energy transformation, water and program management for government and commercial clients. Substantially all of RPS will be included in our CIG segment.

The grants are included as part of our subcontractor costs. Because subcontractor services can vary significantly from project to project and period to period, changes in revenue may not necessarily be indicative of our business trends. Accordingly, we segregate subcontractor costs from revenue to promote a better understanding of our business by evaluating revenue exclusive of costs associated with external service providers. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, revenue and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $36.3 million, or 4.2%, and $57.2 million, or 8.4%, respectively, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. On a constant currency basis, our revenue, and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased approximately 7% and 12%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The aforementioned adverse year-over-year foreign exchange rates primarily impacted our CIG segment. Our GSG segment's revenue and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $15.0 million, or 3.3%, and $26.0 million, or 7.9%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to last year's first quarter. Our CIG segment's revenue increased $23.3 million, or 5.6%, and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased $31.3 million, or 8.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the year-ago quarter. The first quarter fiscal 2023 results for GSG and CIG segments are described below under "Government Services Group" and "Commercial/International Services Group", respectively. The following table reconciles our reported results to non-U.S. GAAP adjusted results, which exclude acquisition expenses related to the RPS acquisition and losses from adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and a non-operating benefit from Employee Retention Credits ("ERC's") received in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Our adjusted earnings per share ("EPS") for the first quarter fiscal 2023 also excludes a non-operating $68.0 million unrealized gain on a foreign exchange contract and the write-off of previously deferred debt origination fees both related to our planned acquisition of RPS. This gain is reported as "Other non-operating income" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rates applied to the adjustments to EPS to arrive at adjusted EPS average 26% for both fiscal 2023 and 2022. We applied the relevant marginal statutory tax rate based on the nature of the adjustments and the tax jurisdiction in which it occurred. Both EPS and adjusted EPS were calculated using diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the respective periods as reflected in our consolidated statements of income. 25

Non-GAAP financial measure Operating income increased $4.8 million, or 5.5%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The first quarter fiscal 2023 results include $3.8 million of acquisition expenses (primarily legal-related) for the RPS acquisition and losses of $0.9 million related to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities. The first quarter fiscal 2022 results included the benefit of ERC's totaling $4.5 million, which represents reimbursement from the U.S. federal government under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act for the costs that we incurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to address the COVID-19 pandemic. These amounts were recognized in fiscal 2022 when the funds were received due to the uncertainty related to the computation of qualifying amounts and delayed processing times for our application. These amounts were primarily reflected as a reduction to "Other costs of revenue" in our Consolidated Statement of Income and an increase to "Net cash provided by operating activities" in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for fiscal 2022, consistent with the presentation of the related costs recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding the acquisition expenses, earn-out losses and the ERC's our adjusted operating income increased $14.0 million, or 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same quarter last year. These increases reflect improved results in both GSG and CIG segments, which are described below under "Government Services Group" and "Commercial/International Services Group", respectively.
Our net interest expense was $5.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $2.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 includes $2.7 million of additional expense for the write-off of previously deferred debt origination fees due
to the cancellation of the bridge loan facility we entered into to support our offer to acquire RPS, which was replaced with an
amendment to our existing debt facility.
Other non-operating income of $68.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 reflects an unrealized gain on a foreign exchange forward contract integrated with the acquisition of RPS. Although an effective economic hedge of our foreign exchange risk related to this transaction, the forward contract does not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the forward contract is marked-to-market with changes in fair value recogni zed in earnings each period. The forward contract was settled on January 23, 2023, together with the closing of the RPS acquisition, with a cumulative gain of approximately $109 million.
The effective tax rates for the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 24.5% and 18.8%, respectively. Income tax expense was reduced by $1.7 million and $4.5 million of excess tax benefits on share-based payments in the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits on share-based payments, our effective tax rates in the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 25.7 % an d 24.1%, respectively .
26 Our EPS was $2.18 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $1.25 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the aforementioned non-operating and non-recurring items, our adjusted EPS was $1.34 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $1.19 in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 12.6%.

The increases primarily reflect higher U.S. state and local government activities related to digital water and federal programs for civilian agencies, partially offset by lower disaster response revenue.
Operating income increased $9.2 million, or 17.9%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to last year's first quarter. The fiscal 2023 results included favorable operating income adjustments for several projects upon their completion. Last year's first quarter results included $3.1 million of the aforementioned ERC's. Our operating margin, based on revenue, net of subcontractor costs, improved to 17.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 15.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the favorable project adjustments in the first quarter of this year and last year's ERC's, our operating margin was 15.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 14.7% in the same period last year. The improved operating margin in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to our increased focus on high-end consulting services, including digital water.

On a constant currency basis, revenue and revenue, net of subcontractor costs, increased 10.9% and 14.8%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period last year. The revenue growth primarily reflects increased activity on high performance buildings and renewable energy.
Operating income increased $4.8 million, or 10.6%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The fiscal 2022 operating income included $1.4 million of the aforementioned ERC's. Excluding this benefit, operating income increased 14.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to last year's first quarter. Our operating margin, based on revenue, net of subcontractor costs, improved to 13.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 12.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the ERC's, our operating margin was 12.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The
27 improved operating margin was primarily due to our increased focus on high-end consulting services, project execution and labor utilization.
Backlog
Backlog generally represents the dollar amount of revenues we expect to realize in the future when we perform the work. The difference between remaining unsatisfied performance obligations
(" RUPO") and backlog relates to contract terms. Specifically, our backlog does not consider the impact of termination for convenience clauses within the contracts. The contract term and thus remaining performance obligation on certain of our operations and maintenance contracts, are limited to the notice period required for contract termination (usually 30, 60, or 90 day s). At January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, the differences between our backlog and RUPO of $3.8 billion for each period were immaterial.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Capital Requirements.
At January 1, 2023, we h ad $164.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and access to an additional
$1.30 billion of borrowings available under our amended credit facility described below. D uring the first three months of fiscal 2023, we generated $25.2 million of cash from operations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash are to fund working capital, stock repurchases, cash dividends, capital expenditures and repayment of debt, as well as to fund acquisitions and earn-out obligations from prior acquisitions.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement as amended in the anticipation of our planned acquisition of RPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as described below, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.
We use a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We currently have no need or plans to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings, other than from Canada, in the foreseeable future; however, this could change due to varied economic circumstances. On October 5, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we could repurchase up to $400 million of our common stock. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. At January 1, 2023, we had a remaining balance of $347.8 million under our stock repurchase program.
On November 7, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share payable on December 9, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 21, 2022.
Subsequent Event.   On January 30, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share payable on February 24, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 13, 2023. Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash.
At January 1, 2023, our cash equivalents and restricted cash w ere $172.2 million, a decrease of $13.3 million compared to the fiscal 2022 year-end.  The decrease was primarily due to payments on dividends and taxes on vested restricted stock, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities.
Operating Activities .   For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $25.2 million, a decrease of $57.2 million compared to the prior-year period.
The decrease was primarily due to the timing of payments to our vendors and employees. Investing Activities .
For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $4.9 million, a decrease of $1.9 million compared to the prior-year period.
The decrease was due to a payment related to an acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Financing Activities .
For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $42.3 million, an increase of $5.9 million compared to fiscal 2022 quarter. The financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 primarily consisted of payments on dividends and taxes on vested restricted stock, and a net repayment of debt.
Debt Financing.
On October 26, 2022, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that provides for an additional $500 million senior secured term loan facility (the "New Term Loan Facility") increasing our total borrowing capacity to $1.55 billion.
Subsequent Event.
We drew the entire amount of the New Term Loan Facility to partially finance the acquisition of RPS in January 2023. The remaining cash payments for the initial purchase price for RPS, including transaction fees and the retirement of RPS's existing debt, and Amyx, which totaled approximately $380 million, was financed with borrowings under
28 the existing Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The New Term Loan Facility is not subject to any amortization payments of principal and matures on the third anniversary of the RPS acquisition closing date.
On February 18, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”) with a total borrowing capacity of $1.05 billion that will mature in February 2027. The Amended Credit Agreement is a $750 million senior secured, five-year facility that provides for a $250 million term loan facility (the “Amended Term Loan Facility”) and a $500 million revolving credit facility (the “Amended Revolving Credit Facility”). In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement includes a $300 million accordion feature that allows us to increase the Amended Credit Agreement to $1.05 billion subject to lender approval. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) refinance indebtedness under our Credit Agreement dated as of July 30, 2018; (ii) finance open market repurchases of common stock, acquisitions and cash dividends and distributions; and (iii) utilize the proceeds for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a reduction in the interest grid for meeting certain sustainability targets related to the (i) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the Company’s projects and operational sustainability initiatives and (ii) improvement of peoples’ lives as a result of the Company’s projects that provide environmental, social and governance benefits. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility includes a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $300 million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings and letters of credit. The entire Amended Term Loan Facility was drawn on February 18, 2022. The Amended Term Loan Facility is subject to quarterly amortization of principal at 5% annually commencing June 30, 2022. We may borrow on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, at our option, at either (a) a benchmark rate plus a margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.875% per annum, or (b) a base rate for loans in U.S. dollars (the highest of the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, the bank’s prime rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that ranges from 0% to 0.875% per annum. In each case, the applicable margin is based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, calculated quarterly. The Amended Term Loan Facility is subject to the same interest rate provisions. The Amended Credit Agreement expires on February 18, 2027, or earlier at our discretion upon payment in full of loans and other obligations. At January 1, 2023, we had $240.6 million. in outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, which was comprised of $240.6 million under the Amended Term Loan Facility and no borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The year-to-date weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding borrowings during January 1, 2023 is 4.87%. In addition, we had $0.7 million in standby letters of credit under the Amended Credit Agreement. Our year-to-date weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, including the effects of interest rate swap agreements described in Note 15, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”, was 4.19%. At January 1, 2023, we had $499.3 million of available credit under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, all of which could be borrowed without a violation of our debt covenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and restrictive covenants, and customary events of default. The financial covenants provide for a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 (total funded debt/EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 (EBITDA/Consolidated Interest Charges, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by first priority liens on (i) the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries, including those subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under the Amended Credit Agreement, and (ii) the accounts receivable, general intangibles and intercompany loans, and those of our subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers. At January 1, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants with a consolidated leverage ratio of 0.71x and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of 24.57x.
In addition to the Amended Credit Agreement, we maintain other credit facilities, which may be used for short-term cash advances and bank guarantees. At January 1, 2023, there were $5.9 million under these facilities, and the aggregate amount of standby letters of credit outstanding was $45.8 million. At January 1, 2023, we had no bank overdrafts related to our disbursement bank accounts.
Inflation.
We believe our operations have not been, and, in the foreseeable future, are not expected to be, materially adversely affected by inflation or changing prices due to the average duration of our projects and our ability to negotiate prices as contracts end and new contracts begin. Dividends.   Our Board of Directors has authorized the following dividends in fiscal 2023: 29   Dividend  Per Share Record Date Total Maximum Payment
(in thousands) Payment Date November 7, 2022 $ 0.23  November 21, 2022 $ 12,186  December 9, 2022 January 30, 2023 $ 0.23  February 13, 2023 N/A February 24, 2023 Income Taxes We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and adjust the allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. The ability or failure to achieve the forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets.
Based on projected future operating results in certain jurisdictions, it is unlikely that the current valuation allowance positions of those jurisdictions could be adjusted in the next 12 months. At
January 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $10.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively.  It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions may significantly decrease within the next 12 months.
These liabilities represent our current estimates of the additional tax liabilities that we may be assessed when the related audits are concluded. If these audits are resolved in a manner more unfavorable than our current expectations, our additional tax liabilities could be materially higher than the amounts currently recorded resulting in additional tax expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the ordinary course of business, we may use off-balance sheet arrangements if we believe that such arrangements would be an efficient way to lower our cost of capital or help us manage the overall risks of our business operations. We do not believe that such arrangements have had a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations. The following is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: • Letters of credit and bank guarantees are used primarily to support project performance and insurance programs. We are required to reimburse the issuers of letters of credit and bank guarantees for any payments they make under the outstanding letters of credit or bank guarantees. Our Amended Credit Agreement and additional letter of credit facilities cover the issu ance of our standby letters of credit and bank guarantees and are critical for our normal operations. If we default on the Amended Credit Agreement or additional credit facilities, our inability to issue or renew standby letters of credit and bank guarantees would impair our ability to maintain normal operations. At January 1, 2023, we had $0.7 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under our Amended Credit Agreement and $45.8 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under our additional letter of credit facilities. • From time to time, we provide guarantees and indemnifications related to our services. If our services under a guaranteed or indemnified project are later determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency, then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies. When sufficient information about claims on guaranteed or indemnified projects is available and monetary damages or other costs or losses are determined to be probable, we recognize such guaranteed losses. • In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various agreements as part of certain unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts where we are jointly and severally liable. We enter into these agreements primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is typically the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. However, we are not able to estimate other amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts and, accordingly, the total potential payment amount under our outstanding performance guarantees cannot be estimated. For cost-plus contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed-price contracts, this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those
30 cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, we may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co-venturers, subcontractors or vendors, for claims. • In the ordinary course of business, our clients may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We are obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made thereunder. Each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of our related contractual obligation. Critical Accounting Policies
Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. To date, there have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies as reported in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. New Accounting Pronouncements
For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Financial Market Risks We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes. In the normal course of business, we have exposure to both interest rate risk and foreign currency transaction and translation risk, primarily related to the Canadian and Australian dollar, and British Pound.
We are exposed to interest rate risk under our Amended Credit Agreement. We can borrow, at our option, under both the Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility. We may borrow on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, at our option, at either (a) a Eurocurrency rate plus a margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.875% per annum, or (b) a base rate for loans in U.S. dollars (the highest of the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, the bank’s prime rate or the SOFR rate plus 1.00%) plus a margin that ranges from 0% to 0.875% per annum.
In each case, the applicable margin is based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, calculated quarterly. The Amended Term Loan Facility is subject to the same interest rate provisions.
Borrowings at the base rate have no designated term and may be repaid without penalty any time prior to the Facility’s maturity date. Borrowings at a SOFR rate have a term no l ess than 30 days and no greater than 180 days and may be prepaid without penalty. Typically, at the end of such term, such borrowings may be rolled over at our discretion into either a borrowing at the base rate or a borrowing at a SOFR rate with similar terms, not to exceed the maturity date of the Facility. The Facility matures on February 18, 2027. At January 1, 2023, we had $240.6 million in outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, which was comprised of $240.6 million under the Amended Term Loan Facility and no borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The year-to-date weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2023 was 4.87%. In August 2018, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements with five banks to fix the variable interest rate on $250 million of our Amended Term Loan Facility. The objective of these interest rate swaps was to eliminate the variability of our cash flows on the amount of interest expense we pay under our Credit Agreement. At January 1, 2023, the notional principal of our outstanding interest swap agreements was $196.9 million ($39.4 million each.) Our year-to-date average effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, including the effects of interest rate swap agreements, at January 1, 2023, was 4.19%. For more information, see Note 15, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.
Most of our transactions are in U.S. dollars; however, some of our subsidiaries conduct business in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian and Australian dollar, and British Pound. Therefore, we are subject to currency exposure and volatility because of currency fluctuations. We attempt to minimize our exposure to these fluctuati ons by matching revenue and expenses in the same currency for our contracts. We report our foreign currency gains and losses in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income. The impact of the foreign currency was immaterial for the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022. W e have foreign currency exchange rate exposure in our results of operations and equity primarily because of the currency translation related to our foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in reduced revenue, operating expenses, assets and liabilities. Similarly, our revenue, operati ng expenses, assets and liabilities will increase if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. For the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022, 29.8% and
31 29.8% of our consolidated revenue, respectively, was generated by our international business. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the effect of foreign exchange rate translation on the consolidated balance sheets was an increase in our equity by $33.1 million compared to a decrease in equity of $0.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These amounts were recognized as adjustments to equity through other comprehensive income.
