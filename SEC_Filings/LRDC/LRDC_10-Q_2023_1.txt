The

Oil, Inc. (the “Company”), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations of the SEC. Nevertheless, the Company believes that the
disclosures in the financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These financial statements and
the notes attached hereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company’s annual
report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on September 13, 2022. Except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes
in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2022 included in the Form 10-K. In the
opinion of management of the Company, all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial
position of the Company as of November 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three and six-month periods
then ended, have been included in the financial statements. The results of operations for the three and six-month periods ended November
30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2023.

ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management of Laredo Oil, Inc. (the “Company”).
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented have been made.
The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 31, 2008, under the name of “Laredo Mining, Inc.”.
On October 21, 2009 the Company changed its name to “Laredo Oil, Inc.”
The
Company is an oil exploration and production, or E&P, company, primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts for mineral
properties. From June 14, 2011 to December 31, 2020, the Company was a management services company, managing the acquisition and conventional
operation of mature oil fields and the further recovery of stranded oil from those fields using enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”)
methods for its sole customer, Stranded Oil Resources Corporation (“SORC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation
(“Alleghany”).
From
its inception through October 2009, the Company was primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts for mineral properties.
After a change in control in October 2009, the Company shifted its focus to locating mature oil fields, with the intention of acquiring
those oil fields and recovering stranded oil using EOR methods. However, the Company was unable to raise the capital required to purchase
any suitable oil fields. On June 14, 2011, the Company entered into several agreements with SORC (collectively, the “2011 SORC
Agreements”) to seek recovery of stranded crude oil from mature, declining oil fields by using the EOR method known as Underground
Gravity Drainage, or UGD. The 2011 SORC Agreements consisted of (i) a license agreement between the Company and SORC (the “SORC
License Agreement”), (ii) a license agreement between the Company and Mark See, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer (the “MS-Company License Agreement”), (iii) an Additional Interests Grant Agreement between the Company and SORC,
(iv) a Management Services Agreement between the Company and SORC (the “MSA”), (v) a Finder’s Fee Agreement between
the Company and SORC (the “Finder’s Fee Agreement”), and a Stockholders Agreement among the Company, SORC and Alleghany
Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of Alleghany (“Alleghany Capital”), each of which were dated June 14, 2011.
The
2011 SORC Agreements stipulated that the Company and Mark See would provide management services and expertise to SORC through exclusive,
perpetual license agreements and the MSA. As consideration for the licenses to SORC, the Company received an interest in SORC’s
net profits, as defined in the 2011 SORC Agreements (the “Royalty”). The MSA provided that the Company would provide the
services of various employees, including Mark See, in exchange for monthly and quarterly management service fees. The monthly management
service fees provided funding for the salaries, benefit costs, and FICA taxes for the Company employees identified in the MSA. The
quarterly management fee totaled $137,500. The Company received the last such payment on October 1, 2020. Prior to December 31, 2020,
SORC also reimbursed the Company for monthly expenses incurred by the Company’s employees in connection with their services to
SORC under the MSA.
As
consideration for the licenses made to SORC, the Company was entitled to receive an interest in SORC’s net profits, as defined
in the SORC License Agreement. Under the SORC License Agreement, the Company agreed that a portion of the Royalty, equal to at least
2.25% of the net profits (“Incentive Royalty”), be used to fund a long-term incentive plan for the benefit of its employees,
as determined by the Company’s board of directors. On October 11, 2012, the Company’s board of directors approved and adopted
the Laredo Royalty Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and the Incentive Royalty was assigned to the Plan. As a result of a Securities
Purchase Agreement, dated December 31, 2020 (the “SORC Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Alleghany, SORC, and
SORC Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“SORC Holdings”), the Company no longer receives any Incentive
Royalties payable pursuant to the Plan, and SORC no longer makes any such payments to the Company.

Pursuant
to the SORC Purchase Agreement, the Company, through SORC Holdings, purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of SORC (the “SORC
Shares”) on December 31, 2020 (the “SORC Purchase Transaction”). As consideration for the SORC Shares, SORC Holdings
paid Alleghany $72,678 (comprised of $55,000 purchase price plus a $17,678 working capital adjustment calculated in accordance with the
SORC Purchase Agreement), and the Company agreed to pay Alleghany a royalty of 5.0% of the Company’s future consolidated revenues
and net profits relating to oil, gas, gas liquids and all other hydrocarbons, subject to certain adjustments, for a period of seven years.
The 2011 SORC Agreements were terminated effective as of December 31, 2020 pursuant to the SORC Purchase Transaction.
Pursuant
to the SORC Purchase Transaction, the Company and Alleghany also entered into a Consulting Agreement (the “Alleghany Consulting
Agreement”), pursuant to which Alleghany agreed to pay the Company an aggregate of approximately $1.245 million during calendar
year 2021 in consideration of the Company providing consulting services to Alleghany from Mark See and Chris Lindsey, the Company’s
then General Counsel and Secretary (for a period of three years for Mr. See and one year for Mr. Lindsey).
The
Company believes that the SORC Purchase Transaction was advantageous to the Company as it simplified in a timely manner the unwinding
of the 2011 SORC Agreements and allowed the Company to acquire vehicles and oil field equipment to be utilized in future oil recovery
projects.
As
the Company now owns SORC, and the 2011 SORC Agreements have been terminated, the Company no longer receives any of the payments outlined
in the 2011 SORC Agreements. As a result, the Company no longer receives management fee revenue from Alleghany, or reimbursement from
Alleghany for the monthly expenses of its employees, which fees and reimbursements were effectively all of the Company’s revenues
prior to the closing of the SORC Purchase Transaction.
Prior
to December 31, 2020, the Company’s management gained specialized know-how and operational experience in evaluating, acquiring,
operating and developing oil and gas properties while implementing UGD projects for Allegheny, as well as gaining expertise designing,
drilling and producing conventional oil wells. Based upon that knowledge, the Company has identified and acquired 45,246 gross acres
and 37,932 net acres of mineral property interests in the State of Montana. The Company began drilling one exploratory well during May
2022. That well has not been completed or put into production. The Company is continuing its efforts to complete the well and begin commercial
production. Simultaneously, the Company is attempting to raise additional funds to continue field development. Each additional well is
planned to have an 80-acre footprint, so the first ten wells would cover approximately 800 acres, or less than two percent of the Company’s
leased acreage. The ability of the Company to secure further funding will determine future plans and the pace of field development.
In
connection with securing this acreage in Montana, Lustre Oil Company LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Lustre”),
entered into an Acquisition and Participation Agreement (the “Erehwon APA”) with Erehwon Oil & Gas, LLC (“Erehwon”).
Under the Erehwon APA, the parties will acquire oil and gas interests and drill, complete, re-enter, re-complete, sidetrack, and equip
wells in Valley County, Daniels County and Roosevelt County, Montana. The Erehwon APA specifies calculations for royalty interests and
working interests for the first ten well completions and first ten well recompletions, and for all additional wells and recompletions
thereafter. Lustre will acquire the initial mineral leases and pay 100% of the acquisition costs, with a cap of $500,000. When the cap
is exceeded, Erehwon will have the option to acquire a 10% working interest in a lease by paying 10% of the acquisition cost of the lease,
resulting in Lustre paying 90% of the lease acquisition costs, on a lease-by-lease basis. Until amounts paid to complete the first ten
new wells and first ten recompletions are repaid, the working interest split between Erehwon and Lustre will be 10%/90%. Thereafter,
the split between Erehwon and Lustre will be 20%/80%. Additional wells and recompletions will have a working interest split equal to
the parties’ respective working interest in the leases, which will be 10% to Erehwon and 90% to Lustre, unless Erehwon exercises
its option to increase its working interest, as described above. Under the Erehwon APA, Lustre will fund 100% of the construction costs
of the first ten wells and first ten completions. Additional wells will be funded 80% by Lustre and 20% by Erehwon; provided, however,
that Erehwon has the option to pay 10% of the costs to increase its working interest to 20%. Royalty expense will consist of the sum
of royalty interest to the landowner and an overriding royalty interest to two individuals (“Prospect Generators”) not to
exceed 6% nor be less than 3%. For the first ten new wells and first ten recompletions, the Prospect Generators will receive an amount
equal to 5% of the cost of each completed producing well.
On
June 30, 2020, the Company entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “Cat Creek Agreement”) of Cat Creek
Holdings LLC (“Cat Creek”), a Montana limited liability company formed as a joint venture with Lipson Investments LLC (“Lipson”)
and Viper Oil & Gas, LLC (“Viper”) for the purchase of certain oil and gas properties in the Cat Creek Field in Petroleum
and Garfield Counties in the State of Montana (the “Cat Creek Properties”). Cat Creek entered into an Asset Purchase and
Sale Agreement (the “Cat Creek Purchase Agreement”) with Carrell Oil Company (“Carrell Oil”) on July 1, 2020.
The Cat Creek Purchase Agreement provides for the purchase of the Cat Creek Properties from Carrell Oil. Upon closing, Carrell Oil received
consideration of $400,000, subject to certain adjustments resulting from revenue, expense and tax allocations. In accordance with the
Cat Creek Agreement, the Company invested $448,900 in Cat Creek for 50% of the ownership interests in Cat Creek, using cash on hand.
Each of Lipson Investments LLC and Viper Oil & Gas, LLC, the other two members of Cat Creek, have ownership interests in Cat Creek
of 25% in consideration of their respective investments of $224,450. Cat Creek will be managed by four directors, two of whom shall be
designated by the Company.

In
January 2022, the Company and Lustre executed a Net Profits Interest Agreement (“NPI Agreement”) with Erehwon and Olfert
No. 11-4 Holdings, LLC (“Olfert Holdings”) for the purpose of funding the first well, Olfert #11-4 (the “Well”),
under the Erehwon APA. In connection with the NPI Agreement, the Company was credited with a contribution of $59,935 of well development
costs, representing a 5.5% interest in Olfert Holdings. The total investment recorded by the Company was $19,435 as of May 31, 2022.
The difference between the $59,935 contribution recorded by Olfert Holdings and the investment recorded by the Company is due to the
investment by the Company being recorded at the carrying value of the assets it contributed to Olfert Holdings. As the Company also currently
serves as the manager of Olfert Holdings, the Company exercises significant influence over its operations. Accordingly, the amount of
the Company’s investment in Olfert is recorded as an equity method investment as of November 30, 2022. See further disclosures
in Note 9.
Basic
and Diluted Loss per Share
Basic
and diluted earnings/(loss) per share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings/(loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings/(loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
As the Company realized a net loss for the six-month period ended November 30, 2022, no potentially dilutive securities were included
in the calculation of diluted loss per share as their impact would have been anti-dilutive. For the six-month period ended November 30,
2021 all options and warrants potentially convertible into common equivalent shares are considered antidilutive and have also been excluded
in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by
the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.

GOING CONCERN
These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has routinely incurred losses since inception,
resulting in an accumulated deficit, and historically has been dependent on one customer for its revenue. The Company entered into the
Agreements with SORC to fund operations and to provide working capital. However, as a result of the SORC Purchase Agreement, except for
payments to be made in calendar year 2021 to the Company under the Alleghany Consulting Agreement, Alleghany no longer funds operations
or provides working capital to the Company or SORC. There is no assurance that in the future such financing will be available to meet
the Company’s needs. This situation raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year following the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements included herein.
The
Company’s management has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining operations for the
next twelve months and beyond. These steps include an ongoing effort to (a) control overhead and expenses; (b) raise funds connected
with specific well development; and (b) raise funds through notes payable and convertible debt to expand and fund property acquisitions,
exploration and development, as well as maintaining operations. The Company has worked to attract and retain key personnel with significant
experience in the industry. At the same time, in an effort to control costs, the Company has required a number of its personnel to multi-task
and cover a wider range of responsibilities in an effort to restrict any increase in the Company’s headcount. There can be no assurance
that the Company can successfully accomplish these steps and it is uncertain that the Company will achieve a profitable level of operations
or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to the Company on satisfactory
terms and conditions, if at all.
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company
to continue as a going concern.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles
of Consolidation
– The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries
after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.
Equity
Method Investment
– Investments classified as equity method consist of investments in companies in which the Company is
able to exercise significant influence but not control. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is
initially recorded at cost, then the Company’s proportional share of investee’s underlying net income or loss is recorded
as a component of “other income” with a corresponding increase or decrease to the carrying value of the investment.
Distributions received from the investee reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investment. These investments are evaluated
for impairment if events or circumstances arise that indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company
has elected to record its portion of the equity method income (loss) with a two-month lag. Accordingly, the financial results for the
equity investment are reported through September 30, 2022. No impairments were recognized for the Company’s equity method
investment during the quarter ended November 30, 2022. See Note 12.
Property
and Equipment
– The carrying value of the Company’s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the
property and equipment, net of any impairments. For business combinations, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at
the acquisition date.
Oil
and Gas Acquisition Costs  – The Company’s oil and gas acquisition and drilling costs include expenditures representing
investments in unproved and unevaluated properties and include non-producing leasehold, leasehold or drilling interest costs, and costs
to drill one exploratory well. Exploratory drilling costs are deferred until the outcome of the well is known. If an exploratory well
finds proved reserves, the deferred costs are transferred to the Company’s Wells and Related Equipment and Facilities accounts.
Absent proved reserves, the deferred costs of the well, net of salvage, are charged to expense. All costs of wells drilled to develop
proved reserves, along with all costs of equipment necessary to produce and handle the hydrocarbons, are capitalized even if a development
well proves dry. Costs are reviewed to determine if impairment has occurred. The Company had oil and gas acquisition and drilling costs
totaling $ 4,268,685
and $ 2,702,715
as of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, respectively.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Other
Revenue
The
Company and Alleghany previously entered into the Alleghany Consulting Agreement (see Note 1), under which Alleghany was obligated to
pay the Company a total of $1,144,471 in quarterly payments beginning January 1, 2021 in consideration for making certain individuals
available for their advice, assistance and support in connection with the oil and gas industry and any questions, issues or matters arising
from Alleghany’s previous ownership of SORC. One such individual is committed to provide services until December 31, 2023. The Company’s
management believes that any work necessary under this obligation was completed prior to December 31, 2021, and recognized revenue on
a monthly basis over the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company recorded $ 286,118
as other revenue for the quarter ended
August 31, 2021.

RECENT AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06–Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives
and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity.
Reporting companies should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, and cannot adopt the guidance in an
interim reporting period. This accounting standard update, which the Company adopted effective June 1, 2022, impacts the ongoing accounting
of the Convertible Notes.
Reporting
companies are allowed to adopt this standard by either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method
of transition. Under the modified retrospective method, entities should apply the guidance to transactions outstanding as of the beginning
of the fiscal year in which the standard was adopted. Transactions that were settled (or expired) during prior reporting periods are
unaffected. The cumulative effect of the change should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at
the date of adoption. Due to the adoption of this accounting standard update under the modified retrospective method, prior periods for
the Company were not restated. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $16,200 cumulative-effect adjustment that increased the opening
balance of retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet due to the reduction in non-cash interest expense associated with the
historical separation of debt and equity components for the Company’s Convertible Notes described in Note 11. The Company also
recorded a $39,718 increase to convertible debt and a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $55,918, due to no longer separating
the embedded conversion feature of the Convertible Notes. This adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
statement of cash flows.
The
Company has reviewed other recently issued accounting standards and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. It does not expect
the adoption of those standards to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
NOTE
6 –
ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS
The
Company accounts for its asset retirement obligations in accordance with Accounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental
Obligations. This requires that legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets be recognized at fair
value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present
value each period, and the capitalized asset is depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset.
In
the absence of quoted market prices, the Company estimates the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using present value
techniques, in which estimates of future cash flows associated with retirement activities are discounted using a credit-adjusted
risk-free rate. The Company’s estimated liability could change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental
regulations change significantly.
The
Company’s asset retirement obligation was established in May 2022, when it commenced drilling the Olfert#11-4 well in
the Lustre oil field. At November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the asset retirement obligation totaled $ 64,850
and $ 61,762 , respectively.
The
Company’s cash flow estimate for the asset retirement obligation is based upon the assumption of a  25-year
expected life of
the well, discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate of 10%.
The
Company’s accretion expense totaling $ 3,088
was recorded in the six months ending November 30, 2022. Since drilling of the Olfert#11-4
well commenced in May 2022, the Company recorded no accretion expense as of May 31, 2022.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company’s financial instruments, as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 825-10-50,
Financial Instruments,
include cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, equity
method investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and notes payable. The equity method investments approximate fair value as
a result of limited activity by the Company since formation. All other instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis, which,
due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value as of November 30, 2022.
Based
on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of notes payable
approximates the carrying value.
Assets
and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
The
estimated fair value of the Company’s oil and gas properties and the asset retirement obligation incurred in the drilling of such
oil and gas wells or assumed in the acquisitions of additional oil and gas working interests are based on an estimated discount cash
flow model and market assumptions. The significant Level 3 assumptions used by the Company in the calculation of estimated discounted
cash flow model include future commodity prices, projections of estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves, expectations for timing
and amount of future development, operating and asset retirement costs, projections of future rates of production, expected recovery
rates and risk adjusted discount rates. See Note 3 for additional information regarding oil and gas property acquisitions.

(UNAUDITED)
NOTE
7 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS –
continued
The
Company estimates the fair value of asset retirement obligations based on the projected discounted future cash outflows required to settle
abandonment and restoration liabilities. Such an estimate requires assumptions and judgments regarding the existence of liabilities,
the amount and timing of cash outflows required to settle the liability, what constitutes adequate restoration, inflation factors, credit
adjusted discount rates, and consideration of changes in legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. The Company determines
the abandonment and restoration cost estimates in conjunction with the Company’s reserve engineers, based on historical information
regarding costs incurred to abandon and restore similar well sites, information regarding current market conditions and costs, and knowledge
of subject well sites and properties. The Company’s asset retirement obligation fair value measurements in the current period were
Level 3 fair value measurements. As further described in Note 6, the Company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Asset retirement obligations are
not measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions
between related parties are considered to be related party transactions even though they may not be given accounting recognition. FASB
ASC 850,
Related Party Disclosures
(“FASB ASC 850”) requires that transactions with related parties that would make
a difference in decision making should be disclosed so that users of the financial statements can evaluate their significance. Related
party transactions typically occur within the context of the following relationships:
●
Affiliates

NET PROFITS INTEREST AGREEMENT
In
January 2022, the Company and Lustre executed the NPI Agreement with Erehwon and Olfert Holdings, with an effective date of October 2021,
for the purpose of funding the Well under the Erehwon APA. The NPI Agreement grants Olfert Holdings a flow of an “Applicable Percentage”
of available funds from the Well in exchange for Olfert Holdings funding of its development. The “Applicable Percentage”
under the NPI Agreement is 90% prior to Payout and 50% after Payout, in which “Payout” means the point in time when the aggregate
of all Net Profits Interest payments made to Olfert Holdings under the NPI Agreement equals 105% of the well development costs. In January
2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Olfert Holdings, dated effective
as of November 2021 (the “Olfert Holdings Operating Agreement”). Pursuant to the Olfert Holdings Operating Agreement, the
Company has agreed to make a capital contribution to Olfert Holdings in the amount of $500,000, out of the $1,500,000 of capital raised
by Olfert Holdings. During October and November of 2021, through Lustre, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, the Company received
advance payments totaling $1.0 million from four investors, pursuant to the NPI Agreement. Pursuant to the Olfert Holdings Operating
Agreement, the Company was credited with an amount equal to $59,935 of well development costs as part of its capital contribution. In
May 2022, a vendor made a $83,822 capital contribution in the form of services rendered. Further, in June 2022, the Company’s Chief
Financial Officer invested $356,243 in Olfert Holdings pursuant to the NPI Agreement. These two contributions fulfilled the Company’s
initial capital contribution commitment under the Olfert Holdings Operating Agreement. The Company has also been appointed as the Manager
of Olfert Holdings. On August 3, 2022, the Company issued a capital call notice to the investors in Olfert Holdings to pay an additional
$461,440 for expenses that Lustre is obligated to pay pursuant the NPI Agreement. As of November 30, 2022, investors had paid $358,747
of the capital call. As of November 30, 2022, Lustre had incurred approximately $3,300,000 in expenses related to the development
of the first well. The Company issued a capital call notice to the investors of Olfert Holdings to pay an additional $1.7 million as
the expenditures exceeded its original budget and certain outstanding construction costs have not been satisfied. We did not raise additional
funds from the capital call, and unpaid contractors have threatened to attach mechanic liens on the well and foreclose on the drilling
site. We intend to raise additional capital, complete the well and pay the amounts owed to contractors.

The
Company made grants of options for the purchase of 650,000 shares of its common stock, at a strike price of $0.19 per share, during the
first quarter of fiscal year 2023. These options vest immediately and expire on June 2, 2032. The Company made grants for the purchase
of 1,600,000 shares of its common stock at a strike price of $0.074 per share, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. These options
vest monthly over three years, beginning August 1, 2021, and expire on August 1, 2031. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing
model to estimate the fair value of options granted under its stock incentive plan.
The
fair value of the stock option grants, as of the respective grant date, during the six months ending November 30, 2022 and 2021 amounted
to approximately $123,487 and $118,387, respectively. The weighted average assumptions used in calculating these values were based on
the following:

The

The Company does not anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future. Volatility is estimated based on the historical share
prices over the same period as the expected life of the stock options. The Company uses the simplified method for determining the expected
term of its stock options.
The
Company recorded share-based compensation for stock option grants totaling $ 142,735

The
Company entered into a financial advisory agreement, dated July 21, 2022 (the “Advisory Agreement”), pursuant to which the
Company engaged Dawson James Securities, Inc. (“Dawson”) to render services as a corporate finance consultant. The term of
the Advisory Agreement is twelve months from the date of the Advisory Agreement, unless terminated by either party with 30 days prior
written notice to the other party, beginning 60 days following the date of the Advisory Agreement. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement,
Dawson will provide advice to the Company concerning business and financial planning, corporate organization and structure, private and
public equity and debt financing, and such other matters as the parties may mutually agree.
As
compensation to Dawson for the services provided under the Advisory Agreement, the Company is to pay Dawson $30,000 per calendar quarter,
with the first such payment being paid one day after the date of execution, and each subsequent payment being due three months after
the previous payment. The Company made the first $30,000 payment in July 2022. The Company also agreed to issue to Dawson 2,600,000 shares
of the Company’s common stock, payable in four installments of (i) 1,000,000 shares issued within three business days after the
date of the Advisory Agreement, (ii) 550,000 shares for the subsequent quarter, and (iii) 525,000 shares for each of the remaining two
quarters of the term of the Advisory Agreement. The first 1,000,000 restricted shares were issued in July 2022. During the six months
ending November 30, 2022, the Company recorded advisory service fees totaling $160,000 with respect to the 1,000,000 shares of common
issued pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.
If
during the term of the Advisory Agreement the Company decides to (i) finance or refinance any indebtedness using a manager or an agent,
or (ii) raise funds by means of a public offering or private placement of equity or debt securities, Dawson will have the right to act
as lead manager, placement agent or agent (or have any affiliate act in such role) for such financing, provided that Dawson has then
secured at least $5,000,000 in equity financing for the Company. As of the date of this filing, Dawson has failed to secure any equity
financing for the Company, and the Company has suspended any additional stock issuances to Dawson under the contract.

issued two convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $ 140,250
(the “Convertible Notes”), receiving
$ 120,000  in net cash proceeds. The Convertible Notes had an original issue discount of $12,750. Additional debt issue costs
of $ 7,500
were deducted from the gross proceeds from the Convertible Notes. The Company is amortizing a total of $20,250 recorded
as debt discount using the effective interest method through the maturity dates of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are due
in one year from the date of issuance, accrue interest at 8% per annum (22% upon the occurrence of an event of default) and are convertible
180 days after issuance into shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount of 25% of the average of the three lowest trading
prices during the 15 trading days immediately preceding the conversion.
In
October 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company issued
a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $ 55,000 , receiving $ 45,000  in net cash proceeds. The note had an original
issue discount of $5,000. Further $ 5,000  debt issue costs were deducted from the gross proceeds. The total of $ 10,000  recorded
as debt discount are being amortized using the effective interest method through the maturity dates of the convertible promissory note.
The convertible promissory note is due in one year from the date of issuance, accrues interest at 12% per annum (22% upon the occurrence
of an event of default) and is convertible after 180 days into shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount of 30% of the
average of the three lowest trading prices during the 15 trading days immediately preceding the conversion.
On
September 6, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company
issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $ 97,625 , receiving $ 85,000  in net cash proceeds. The convertible
promissory note had an original issue discount of $8,875. Further, $ 3,750
in debt issue costs were deducted from the gross proceeds.
The total of $ 12,625  recorded as debt discount is being amortized using the effective interest method through the maturity dates
of the convertible promissory note. The convertible note is due in one year from the date of issuance, accrues interest at 8% per annum
(22% upon the occurrence of an event of default) and is convertible after 180 days into shares of the Company’s common stock at
a discount of 25% of the average of the three lowest trading prices during the 15 trading days immediately preceding the conversion.
In
October, November, December of 2021, and March, April and May of 2022, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with three
accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company issued six convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $ 608,575
receiving $ 527,500  in net cash proceeds. The Convertible Notes had an original issue discount of $58,575. Additional debt issue
costs of $ 22,500
were deducted from the gross proceeds from the Convertible Notes. The Company is amortizing a total of $ 81,075  recorded

with the beneficial conversion feature in connection with the Convertible Notes resulting in a further increase in the debt discount
of $55,918 which is amortized using the effective interest method through the dates the notes are initially convertible. The additional
debt discount was subsequently reversed during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 as follows.

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities
and equity. Entities should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and cannot adopt the guidance in an
interim reporting period. This accounting standard update, which was adopted by the Company effective June 1, 2022, impacts the ongoing
accounting of the convertible notes.
The
Company adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method of transition and applied the guidance to transactions outstanding
as of the beginning of the current fiscal year on June 1, 2022. Transactions that were settled (or expired) during prior reporting periods
are unaffected. The cumulative effect of the change is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the
date of adoption. Due to the adoption of this accounting standard update under the modified retrospective method, prior periods were
not restated. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $16,200 cumulative-effect adjustment that increased the opening balance of retained
earnings on the consolidated balance sheet due to the reduction in non-cash interest expense associated with the historical separation
of debt and equity components for the Company’s Convertible Notes. The Company also recorded a $39,718 increase to convertible
debt and a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $55,918 due to no longer separating the embedded conversion feature of the Convertible
Notes. This adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows.
The
Company has the right to prepay the Convertible Notes at any time during the first six months the Convertible Notes are outstanding at
the rate of (a) 110% of the unpaid principal amount of such note plus interest, during the first 120 days the note is outstanding, and
(b) 115% of the unpaid principal amount of such note plus interest between days 121 and 180 after the issuance date of the note. The
Convertible Notes may not be prepaid after the 180 th  day following the issuance date unless the applicable note holders
agree to such repayment and such terms.
The
Company agreed to reserve the number of shares of its common stock that may be issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes while
the Convertible Notes are outstanding.
The
Convertible Notes provide for standard and customary events of default, such as failing to timely make payments under the Convertible
Notes when due, the failure of the Company to timely comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reporting requirements and the failure
to maintain a listing on the OTC Markets. The Convertible Notes also contain customary positive and negative covenants. The Convertible
Notes include penalties and damages payable to the noteholders in the event the Company does not comply with the terms of the Convertible
Notes, including in the event the Company does not issue shares of common stock to the noteholders upon conversion of the Convertible
Notes within the time periods set forth therein. Additionally, upon the occurrence of certain defaults, as described in the Convertible
Notes, the Company is required to pay the noteholders liquidated damages in addition to the amount owed under the Convertible Notes (including
in some cases up to 300% of the amount of the applicable Convertible Note).
At
no time may the Convertible Notes be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock if such conversion would result in the
noteholders and their affiliates owning shares representing in excess of 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock.
The
proceeds from the Convertible Notes could be used by the Company for general corporate purposes.
During
October and November 2022, the Company repaid the single Convertible Note entered into on April 14, 2022. To satisfy the obligation,
the note holder received 1,468,042 common shares of Laredo Oil, Inc. at an average price of $0.0806 per share to repay $114,125 of principal
and $4,150 of accrued interest.
On
September 2, 2022 the Company repaid the single Convertible Note entered into on March 1, 2022. The repayment totaled $64,088, comprised
of $53,625 principal and $10,463 in related accrued interest and prepayment penalty interest. Further, the related deferred debt discount
and debt issue costs totaling $4,371 were recorded as interest expense.
On
June 27, 2022, the Company repaid the single Convertible Note entered into in December 2021. The repayment totaled $65,745, comprised
of $55,000 principal and $10,745 in related accrued interest and prepayment penalty interest. Further, the related deferred debt discount
and debt issue costs totaling $4,435 were recorded as interest expense.
During
April and May 2022, the Company repaid the Convertible Notes entered into in October and November 2021. The repayment for remaining Convertible
Notes totaled $136,479, comprised of $114,125 principal and $22,354 related accrued interest and prepayment penalty interest. The
Company borrowed $136,479 from Cat Creek to repay the Convertible Notes.
The
Convertible Note issued in November 2021 was repaid in an amount that totaled $85,469, comprised of $71,500 principal and $13,969 related
accrued interest and prepayment penalty interest.
Upon
the repayment of the October and November 2021 Convertible Notes, the Company amortized the related remaining outstanding debt discount
and debt issue costs totaling $12,388, which were recorded as interest expense.

the Revolving Note. The Revolving Note has a maturity date of May 1, 2023, or such later date as requested by the Company and agreed
in writing by AEI in its sole discretion. Under the Revolving Note, AEI may, at its sole discretion, make advances to the Company upon
the Company’s request in amounts not to exceed an aggregate amount of $150,000 in any 30-day period and not to exceed the full
principal amount of the Revolving Note in the aggregate. The Revolving Note accrues interest on the outstanding principal sum at the
rate of 8.75% per annum, which is payable by the Company every 90 days following the date of the first drawdown. All unpaid principal,
accrued interest and any other amounts will be due and payable on the May 1, 2023 maturity date.
In
accordance with the Revolving Note, AEI is entitled, upon its issuance of a conversion notice to the Company, to convert all or any part
of the outstanding and unpaid principal and accrued interest amount under the Revolving Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares
of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price equal the following:
-
if the Company’s common stock is not listed for trading on an exchange or quoted for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink
Sheets, the lesser of (i) par value of the Company’s common stock or (ii) the cost basis of the most recent, non-affiliate issuance
of common stock, or
-
if the Company’s common stock is listed for trading on an exchange or quoted for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board or the OTC Markets
Group, a 20% discount to the closing price of the common stock as reported by the Company’s primary market on the trading day immediately
preceding the issuance of the conversion notice by AEI to the Company.
In
no event may the Revolving Note be converted into shares of common stock or other securities of the Company to the extent that such conversion
would result in AEI and its affiliates beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.
The
Company did not provide any collateral or guarantees for the Revolving Note, nor did the Company pay any facility charge to obtain the
loan represented by the Revolving Note. The Revolving Note requires consent by AEI for the Company to take certain actions, including,
among others, any redemption, repurchase, acquisition or declaration or payment of any cash dividend or distribution on any capital stock
of the Company, increase in the par value of the Company’s common stock, issuance of debt or sale of substantially all assets or
stock, as well as customary events of default, including, among others, those relating to failure to make payment, bankruptcy, breaches
of representations and termination or impairment of the Company’s business in any material respect. The Company may prepay the
Revolving Note at any time without payment of any penalty or premium. The Company is currently negotiating with AEI for terms for the
Company’s repayment of the outstanding balance.

Impact
of COVID-19 to our Business
The
long-term impacts of the global emergence of novel coronavirus 2019, or COVID-19, on our business are currently unknown. In an effort
to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took proactive, aggressive action from the earliest signs of the outbreak in China
to adopt social distancing policies at our locations, including working from home, limiting the number of employees attending meetings,
reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. We anticipate that the global health crisis
caused by COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact business activity. We have observed declining demand and price reductions in the
oil and gas sector as business and consumer activity decelerates across the globe. When COVID-19 is demonstrably contained, we anticipate
a rebound in economic activity, depending on the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national,
state, and local governments.
We
will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in
the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities.
It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our
customers, employees, and prospects, or on our financial results for the remainder of fiscal year 2023.
Company
Description and Operations
We
are an oil exploration and production company, primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts to find mineral reserves on various
properties. From our inception in March 2008 through October 2009, we were primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts for
mineral properties. Beginning in October 2009, we shifted our focus to locating mature oil fields, with the intention of acquiring those
oil fields and recovering stranded oil using enhanced recovery methods. From June 14, 2011 to December 31, 2020, we were a management
services company, managing the acquisition and operation of mature oil fields, focused on the recovery of “stranded” oil
from those mature fields using enhanced oil recovery methods for our then sole customer, Stranded Oil Resources Corporation, or SORC,
then a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation. We performed those services in exchange for a quarterly management fee and the
reimbursement from SORC of our employee related expenses, which fees and reimbursements were effectively all of our revenues prior to
the closing of the Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany described below.
On
December 31, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany Corporation. Under that agreement, we purchased all
of the issued and outstanding shares of SORC. As consideration for the SORC shares, we paid Alleghany $72,678 in cash and agreed to pay
Alleghany a seven-year royalty of 5.0% of our future revenues and net profits from our oil, gas, gas liquids and all other hydrocarbons,
subject to certain adjustments. The royalty rate increased to 6.0% after December 31, 2022. Currently, there are no ongoing operations
being conducted by SORC.
Under
the Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany, we also entered into a Consulting Agreement, under which Alleghany paid us an aggregate
of approximately $1.245 million during calendar year 2021 in exchange for our providing Alleghany with one to three years of consulting
services from certain of our employees, including Mark See, our Chief Executive Officer.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
– continued
Alleghany
no longer pays us any management fees or reimbursement payments for the monthly expenses of our employees. Those fees and reimbursements
were effectively all of our revenues prior to the closing of the Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany described above.
While
we were providing services to Alleghany prior to December 31, 2020, we gained know-how and operational experience in evaluating, acquiring,
operating and developing oil and gas properties using enhanced oil recovery methods. We also gained experience in designing, drilling
and producing conventional oil wells without using those methods.
We
have identified and leased 45,246 gross acres, and 37,932 net acres, of mineral property interests in the State of Montana. We began
drilling one exploratory well during May 2022, which has not been completed and has not been put into production. We are continuing our
efforts to complete the well and begin commercial production. Simultaneously, we are raising funds to continue field development. Each
additional well is planned to have an 80-acre footprint, so the first 10 wells would affect approximately 800 acres, or less than two
percent of the leased acreage. The ability to secure further funding will drive future plans and the pace of field development.
In
connection with our securing the acreage in Montana described above, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lustre Oil Company LLC, or Lustre,
entered into an Acquisition and Participation Agreement with Erehwon Oil & Gas, LLC, or Erehwon. The agreement with Erehwon allows
us to acquire oil and gas interests, and drill, complete and equip wells, in Valley County, Daniels County and Roosevelt County, Montana.
Our agreement with Erehwon also specifies calculations for royalty interests and working interests we will receive for the first ten
well completions, and first ten well recompletions, defined as the completion of a well for production from an existing well bore in
another formation. We will acquire the initial mineral leases, and pay 100% of the initial acquisition costs, up to $500,000. When the
total costs exceed $500,000, Erehwon has the option to acquire a 10% working interest in any lease we acquired by paying us 10% of our
acquisition cost of that lease, resulting in our paying 90% of the applicable lease’s acquisition costs. Until we are repaid the
full amount we paid to complete the first ten wells and first ten recompletions in the acreage, the working interest split will remain
10% to Erehwon and 90% to us. After we have recovered our acquisition costs, Erehwon will receive a 20% working interest. Additional
wells and recompletions will have a working interest split equal to 10% to Erehwon and 90% to us, unless Erehwon exercises its option
to increase its working interest by 10%, as described above.
Under
the Erehwon agreement, we fund 100% of the construction costs of the first ten wells and first ten completions. The lease acquisition
costs of any additional wells will be funded 100% by us; provided, however, that Erehwon will have the option to repay to us 10% of our
acquisition costs to increase its working interest to 20%. Royalty expense for these wells will consist of a royalty interest to the
landowner and an overriding royalty interest of between 3% and 6% for two individuals who generated the prospects. The two individuals
who generated the prospects will also receive an amount equal to 5% of the cost of the first ten new completed wells and the first ten
completed recompletions.
In
January 2022, we executed a Net Profits Interest Agreement with Erehwon and Olfert No. 11-4 Holdings, LLC, or Olfert Holdings, for the
purpose of funding the first well, Olfert #11-4, under the Acquisition and Participation Agreement described above. In exchange for Olfert
Holdings’ funding of the development of the first well, Olfert Holdings receives 90% of funds resulting from Olfert #11-4 prior
to “Payout” and 50% after “Payout.” The Net Profits Interest Agreement defines “Payout” as the point
in time when the aggregate of all ‘Net Profits Interest’ payments made to Olfert Holdings under the agreement equals 105%
of the total well development costs.
In
January 2022, we also entered into the operating agreement for Olfert Holdings. Pursuant to this operating agreement, we agreed to make
a capital contribution to Olfert Holdings in the amount of $500,000, out of an aggregate of $1,500,000 of capital to be raised by Olfert
Holdings. As of May 31, 2022, we were credited with a contribution totaling $59,935 of well development costs, representing a 5.5% interest
in Olfert Holdings, based upon the market value of the assets we contributed. Since then, other investors, including our chief financial
officer (see Related Party Transactions), assumed and funded our remaining capital contribution commitment.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
– continued
On
June 30, 2020, we entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement of Cat Creek Holdings LLC, a Montana limited liability company,
forming a joint venture with Lipson Investments LLC and Viper Oil & Gas, LLC for the purchase of certain oil and gas properties in
the Cat Creek Field in Petroleum County and Garfield County in the State of Montana. Cat Creek Holdings entered into an Asset Purchase
and Sale Agreement with Carrell Oil Company on July 1, 2020. Upon closing under that agreement, Cat Creek Holdings paid Carrell Oil $400,000
in cash, subject to certain adjustments resulting from pre- and post-effective date revenue, expense and tax allocations, in exchange
for the Cat Creek Field properties. We invested $448,900 in Cat Creek Holdings for 50% of its ownership interests. Lipson Investments
LLC and Viper Oil & Gas, LLC, the other two members of Cat Creek Holdings, have ownership interests of 25% each, which they received
for their respective investments of $224,450. Cat Creek Holdings is managed by four managers, two of which are designated by us.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
a result of the transactions described above, we no longer receive management fee revenue, operations reimbursements, or royalty distributions
from Alleghany or SORC. Any cash we expend for operations and oil field expansion and development comes from our sales of debt and equity
securities. We have a reserve report from an independent petroleum engineering firm estimating that interests of proved undeveloped,
probable undeveloped and contingent reserves, and forecasts of economics attributable to certain properties in the Western Williston
Basin of Montana for oil interests acquired by Lustre Oil Company, LLC, or Lustre, total $67 million of cash flow, discounted at a 10%
discount rate. This evaluation, dated effective May 31, 2022, was prepared using constant prices and costs, and conforms to Item 1202(a)(8)
of Regulation S-K and other rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We believe that the reserve report pertains to a small
portion of the total acreage of mineral rights leased by Lustre. As of the date of this filing, we have no producing oil wells on our
Montana leases. We are focused on raising funds to drill and produce the oil identified in the reserve report. We are currently focused
on two programs summarized below.
First,
we are in the process of attempting to raise up to $7.5 million from the sale of secured convertible promissory notes for operating capital,
and to drill three production wells and a salt water disposal well on selected acreage leased by Lustre Oil Company. The mineral rights
underlying the proposed wells have been contributed to our 100% wholly owned subsidiary, Hell Creek Crude, LLC, the units of which are
subject to a pledge agreement and serve as collateral securing the promissory notes. The notes are also convertible into shares of our
common stock at $1.00 per share. As of the filing date, we have issued $490,000 in principal amount of promissory notes to fund the three
well program.
Second,
we are working with a financial advisor to raise up to $40 million to develop a 23 well program on acreage where we have leased mineral
rights. We are having ongoing discussions with various private equity groups, family offices and individual accredited investors regarding
financing alternatives. The form of financing could include our selling working interests in individual leases.
Our
cash and cash equivalents at November 30, 2022 was $99,669. Our total debt outstanding as of November 30, 2022 was $3,316,385, including
(i) $617,934 owed to Alleghany, which is classified as a long-term note payable, and (ii) $1,041,655 pursuant to the PPP notes, of which
we have classified $697,556 as a long-term note, net of the current portion, totaling $344,099, which is classified as a current note
payable, (iii) $645,938 short term convertible notes, net of deferred debt discount, (iv) $110,858 revolving note classified as short-term,
(v) a $750,000 note payable due to Cali Fields LLC, classified as short-term and (vi) a $150,000 demand note payable classified as short-term
and due to our Chief Financial Officer.
On
April 28, 2020, we borrowed $1,233,656 under the terms of the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP, authorized by the Coronavirus
Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. On July 19, 2021, we were notified that $1,209,809 of the principal amount of our PPP
loan had been forgiven, leaving $23,847 in principal payable over the remaining five-year life of the loan. We are repaying the PPP loan
through monthly payments of principal and accrued interest in the amount of $559 per payment, through April 28, 2025.
Effective
as of February 3, 2021, we received a second PPP loan in the amount of $1,233,655. On April 25, 2022, $66,682 of the principal amount
of the loan was forgiven, leaving $1,166,973 payable over the remaining life of the five-year loan. We are repaying the loan through
monthly payments of $26,752 beginning June 3, 2022 and ending February 2026.
Results
of Operations
During
the three and six months ending November 30, 2021, we recorded other revenue and direct costs totaling $286,118 and $572,236, respectively,
for continued consulting services we provided to Alleghany after the termination of the Management Services Agreement effective December
31, 2020. We did not record any similar revenues and direct costs during the six months ending November 30, 2022, as these consulting
services were completed effective December 31, 2021.
During
the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we incurred operating expenses of $1,552,653 and $380,431, respectively. These expenses
consisted of general operating expenses incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business, the preparation and filing
of our required public reports and stock option compensation expense. In addition, commencing on January 1, 2022, our payroll related
expenses are now also included in the general operating expenses, as we are no longer providing any direct management or consulting services.
The increase in expenses for the six months ended November 30, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily attributable
to these payroll costs, increased accounting and other professional fees, including public relations and advisory services, and stock-based
compensation. We also experienced increases in other general and administrative expenses, including insurance and SEC filing costs.
25
ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
– continued
During
the six months ended November 30, 2022, we recognized other income and expenses comprised of (i) the $122,682 we received from the Employee
Retention Credit established by the CARES Act, (ii) $74,502 in equity method loss related to our Cat Creek equity investment, and (iii)
$23,885 in other income. During the six months ended November 30, 2021, we recognized other income and expenses comprised of the $1,224,908
gain on the PPP loan forgiveness of both principle and accrued interest, a $7,844 equity method loss and $131,153 in other income for
the sale of a license.
As
of the filing date of this report, the Olfert 11-4 exploratory well spudded in May 2022 has not yet been completed and put into production.
We have discovered economic levels of hydrocarbons, but we have encountered saltwater intrusion, which necessitates access to a proximate
saltwater injection well to economically dispose of the water. We are continuing our efforts to gain access to a disposal well to complete
the well and begin economical production.
The
Olfert 11-4 well has exceeded its original budget and there are some outstanding construction costs that we have not satisfied. To pay
these amounts owed, we issued an additional capital call to the net profits interest investors who have no obligation to participate
or invest additional funds. We did not raise additional funds from the capital call, and unpaid contractors have threatened to attach
mechanic liens on the well and foreclose on the drilling site. We intend to raise additional capital, complete the well and pay the amounts
owed to contractors.
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The
process of preparing consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of liabilities and stockholders’ equity/(deficit) at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include estimates
related to the valuation of stock-based compensation and asset retirement obligation. Changes in the status of certain facts or circumstances
could result in a material change to the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results
could differ from the estimates and assumptions.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We
do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements or other such unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed the debt of
any other party.
ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our
exposure to market risk is confined to our cash equivalents. We invest in high-quality financial instruments and we believe we are subject
to limited credit risk. Due to the short-term nature of our cash, we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate
risk arising from our investments.
ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and forms. Our disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including
the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure
controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily is required
to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
An
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer,
or CEO and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in
insuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in
a timely manner, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
Our
small size and limited resources have prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level
of supervision and segregation of duties. Further we have limited specific oil and gas accounting personnel in our accounting department
due to our small size and lack of resources. Therefore, it is difficult for us to effectively segregate accounting duties and have proper
oil and gas financial reporting, which creates a material weakness in internal controls. This lack of segregation of duties and limited
oil and gas specific personnel leads management to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to give reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported as and when required.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
