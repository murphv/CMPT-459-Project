YUENGLING’S ICE CREAM CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JANUARY 31, 2023
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 –
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Yuengling’s Ice Cream Corporation, (f/k/a
Aureus, Inc.) (“ Yuengling’s ,” “ YCRM ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or
the “ Company ”) was incorporated in Nevada on April 19, 2013, under the name “Aureus Incorporated.”
We were initially organized to develop and explore mineral properties in the state of Nevada. Effective December 15, 2017, we changed
our name to “Hohme, Inc.,” and, effective February 7, 2019, we changed our name to “Aureus, Inc. and on September
14, 2021, the Company changed their name to Yuengling’s Ice Cream Corporation”. We are currently active in the state of Nevada.
We are a food brand development company that builds
and represents popular food concepts throughout the United States and international markets. Management is highly experienced at business
integration and re-branding potential. With little territory available for the older brands, we intend to bring to our customers fresh
innovative brands that have great potential. All of our brands will be unique in nature as we focus on niche markets that are still in
need of development.
We operate two lines of business. Through our
subsidiary, YIC Acquisitions Corp. (“ YICA ”), we acquired the assets of Yuengling’s Ice Cream in June 2019. YICA
produces and sells high-quality ice cream without artificial colors, flavoring, or preservatives and no added hormones.
In September 2020, we entered into the micro market
segment and launched our second business line, Aureus Micro Markets (“ AMM ”). Closely tied to the vending machine industry,
Micro Markets look and feel like modern convenience stores while functioning with the ease and efficiency of vending foodservice and refreshment
services.
On December 9, 2022, the Company entered into
an exclusive licensing agreement with GPO Plus, Inc. (OTCQB: GPOX). GPOX will develop a full line of CBD and other hemp derived cannabinoid
products based on the iconic flavors of Yuengling’s Ice Cream. The initial term of the Agreement runs through November 30, 2027,
with an option to extend for an additional five years. In consideration for the trademark license, GPOX will pay the Company a royalty
of 5% of all gross wholesale revenue generated from the sale of Yuengling’s Ice Cream branded products. Additional details regarding
products, flavors, launch date and where the product will be sold will be provided in the near future.
NOTE 2 –
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal
recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods
shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending October 31, 2023. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s
financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2022.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts,
the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We continually monitor our banking relationships and consequently
have not experienced any losses in our accounts. We believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.
8
Restricted Cash
The Company has an obligation to transfer
$ 50,000
to Mid Penn Bank
as security pursuant to the Agreement of Sale and Security Agreement with Mid Penn Bank and Yuengling Ice Cream Corp, by April
30, 2023. If the funds are not transferred by April 30, 2023, the Bank the has option to call the loan and to require the
Company to pay any attorney’s fees incurred.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
Net income (loss) per common share is computed
pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted net
income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and
potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially
outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. As of January 31, 2023
and 2022, there are
255,524,518
and
23,539,271
potentially dilutive shares, respectively, if the Preferred A were to be converted. As
of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share, as the inclusion of
any potential shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect due to the Company generating a loss.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary YIC Acquisitions Corp. All material transactions and balances have
been eliminated on consolidation.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company evaluates its convertible notes to
determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments
that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each
reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments,
the Company uses a weighted-average Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on
subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that
would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC Topic No. 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as described below:
Level 1: Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Level 2 inputs are inputs other than
quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar
assets, quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active, and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest
rates.
Level 3: Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs.
The following required disclosure of the estimated
fair value of financial instruments has been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the use of different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the
fair values of each class of financial instruments are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, and Accounts Payable.
The items are generally short-term in nature, and accordingly, the carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable
approximations of their fair values.
The carrying amounts of Notes Payable approximate
the fair value as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates.

liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of January 31, 2023:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued
that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
NOTE 3 –
GOING CONCERN
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 4,138,344 , had a net loss of $ 106,219 , and net
cash used in operating activities of $ 31,597
for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The Company’s ability to raise additional
capital through the future issuances of common stock and/or debt financing is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful
development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations
are necessary for the Company to continue operations. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments
that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.
NOTE 4 -
PROPERTY & EQUIPMENT
Property and Equipment are first recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets as follows between
three and five years.
Long lived assets, including property and equipment,
to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized if expected future cash flows of the related assets are less
than their carrying values. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Maintenance and repair expenses, as incurred,
are charged to expense. Betterments and renewals are capitalized in plant and equipment accounts. Cost and accumulated depreciation applicable
to items replaced or retired are eliminated from the related accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included as income.
Property and equipment stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation consisted of the following:

fixed assets have
no t yet been placed in service. Depreciation will begin on the date the assets are placed into service. If the Company
does not pursue the Micro Markets business, it may be able to use the shelving and racks in its current business.

PREFERRED STOCK
Series A Preferred
The Company has designated Ten Million ( 10,000,000 )
shares of Preferred Stock the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with a par and stated value of $ 0.001
per share. The holders of the
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are not entitled to receive any dividends.
Except as otherwise required by law or by the
Articles of Incorporation and except as set forth below, the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote together
with the shares of Common Stock and other voting securities of the Corporation as a single class and, regardless of the number of shares
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding and as long as at least one of such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
is outstanding shall represent Sixty Six and Two Thirds Percent (66 2/3%) of all votes entitled to be voted at any annual or special meeting
of shareholders of the Corporation or action by written consent of shareholders. Each outstanding share of the Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock shall represent its proportionate share of the 66 2/3% which is allocated to the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock.
The entirety of the shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock outstanding as such time shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time,
and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into two thirds of the after conversion outstanding fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Common Stock. Each individual share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be convertible into Common
Stock at a ratio determined by dividing the number of shares of Series A Convertible Stock to be converted by the number of shares of
outstanding pre-conversion Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Such initial Conversion Ratio, and the rate at which shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock. As of January 31, 2023, there are
5,000,000
shares of Series
A preferred stock owned by the CEO.
As of January 31, 2023, the Company has preferred
stock to be issued in the amount of $ 392,022 . As of January 31, 2023, the preferred Series A can be converted at $ 0.00195
per share, into
201,036,774
shares of common stock. As of the balance sheet date and the date of this report, these shares have not been issued to the
Purchaser. S99-3A(2) ASR 268 requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside
of permanent equity if they are redeemable (1) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (2) at the option of
the holder, or (3) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. Given that there is an unknown
amount of preferred shares to be issued, cash has been repaid and the preferred shares are convertible at the option of the holder, the
Company determined that mezzanine treatment appears appropriate. As such, the Company feels these securities should be classified
as Mezzanine equity until they are fully issued.

performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation
to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this quarterly report to conform forward-looking statements
to actual results. Important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning uncertainties, including but not limited

·
Our failure to earn revenues or profits;
·
Inadequate capital to continue business;

with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this quarterly report. This discussion contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in any
forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of various factors.

Results of Operations
The three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three
months ended January 31, 2022
Revenue
We had no revenue for the three months ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022.
General and administrative expenses
We had $14,964 of general and administrative expenses
(“G&A”) for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $37,624 for the three months January 31, 2022, a decrease
of $22,660 or 60.2%. The decrease is primarily due to a $6,100 decrease in consulting expense and decreases for other office expense.

We incurred $22,500 and $18,000 of officer compensation for the three
months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company is compensating Robert Bohorad, CEO, $5,000 per month. In the current
period we also recognized $7,500 of non-cash stock compensation expense as officer compensation.
Professional fees
We incurred $12,783 of professional fees for the
three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $43,803 for the three months ended January 31, 2022, a decrease of $31,020 or 70.8%.
Professional fees generally consist of audit, legal, accounting and investor relation service fees. The decrease is primarily due to an
approximate $15,700 decrease in audit fees and a $15,100 decrease of investor relation expense.

had total other expense of $55,972, compared to total other expense of $20,358 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. In the current

We received $96,000 from proceeds from the sale of common stock. We repaid $51,411 on our notes payable and $106,201 towards our LOC.
Going Concern
As of January 31, 2023, there is substantial doubt
regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our operations.
We have suffered recurring losses from operations
and have not yet generated any revenue. As a result of these and other factors, our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future success and viability, therefore, are dependent upon our ability to generate
capital financing. The failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon
us and our shareholders.
16
Management’s plans with regard to these
matters encompass the following actions: (i) obtaining funding from new investors to alleviate our working capital deficiency, and (ii)
implementing our plan of operation to generate sales. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to resolve our liquidity problems
and increase profitability in our business operations. However, the outcome of management’s plans cannot be ascertained with any
degree of certainty. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these risks and uncertainties.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Refer to Note 2 of our financial statements contained elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q for a summary of our critical accounting policies and to Note 2 our financial statements contained in our Form 10-K for
a more complete summary of our critical accounting policies.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Each of our principal executive and principal
financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d -
15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this
quarterly report. Based on their evaluation, each such person concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of January 31, 2023.
The following aspects of the Company were noted
as potential material weaknesses:
·
Due to our size and limited resources, we currently do not employ the appropriate accounting personnel to ensure (a) we maintain proper segregation of duties, (b) that all transactions are entered timely and accurately, and (c) we properly account for complex or unusual transactions;
·
Due to our size and scope of operations, we currently do not have an independent audit committee in place;
·
Due to our size and limited resources, we have not properly documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting.
In designing and evaluating disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.
Our management has evaluated whether any change
in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, management concluded
that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the relevant period that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
