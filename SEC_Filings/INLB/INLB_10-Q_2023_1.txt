SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain
information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other filings of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as well as information
communicated orally or in writing between the dates of such filings, contains or may contain "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, including without limitation, statements related to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy
of resources, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements
are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Among
these risks, trends and uncertainties are the availability of working capital to fund our operations, the competitive market in which
we operate, the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems, our ability to generate a profit and
execute our business plan, the retention of key personnel, our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property, the effects of
governmental regulation, and other risks identified in the Registrant's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time
to time.
In
some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "should,"
"could," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts,"
"potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. Although the Registrant
believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, the Registrant cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither the Registrant, nor any other person, assumes responsibility
for the accuracy and completeness of such statements. The Registrant is under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements
contained herein after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM
9 LABS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note
1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description
of Business
Item
9 Labs Corp. ("Item 9 Labs" or, including its subsidiaries, the "Company"), formerly Airware Labs Corp., is a Delaware
corporation. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 15, 2010 as Crown Dynamics Corp.
Item
9 Labs is a holding company, investing in cannabis and cannabis-related businesses. Its subsidiaries currently compete in two different
market segments: (1) producing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products and technologies through its Item 9 Labs brand (“Cultivation”),
which is currently distributed though out the State of Arizona in licensed medical and adult-use dispensaries; and (2) sell medical and
adult-use cannabis dispensary franchises under its franchise brand “Unity Rd.” (“Franchising”).
In
March 2021, the Company closed on the acquisition of OCG, Inc, dba Unity Rd, a dispensary franchisor, with the effect of OCG, Inc. becoming
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Unity Rd has agreements with more than twenty (20) entrepreneurial groups to open more than
thirty (30) Unity Rd retail dispensary locations in twelve (12) states. The majority of the locations are in the licensing process. We
currently have two franchisees operating in Hartford, South Dakota and Boulder, Colorado. Unity Rd will be the vehicle to bring Item
9 Labs products across the United States and internationally, while keeping dispensaries locally owned and operated, empowering entrepreneurs
to operate their business and contribute to their local communities. As the Unity Rd dispensaries achieve sufficient market penetration,
Item 9 Labs aims to offer its products in those locations to expand the distribution footprint of its premium product offerings.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2022 have been prepared by us without audit
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and do not include all of the information
and notes necessary for a presentation of financial position and results of operations in accordance with US GAAP and should be read
in conjunction with our September 30, 2022 audited financial statements filed with the SEC on our Form 10-K on January 13, 2023. It is
management's opinion that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made, which are necessary for
a fair financial statement presentation. We derived the September 30, 2022 condensed consolidated balance sheet data from audited financial
statements, however, we did not include all disclosures required by US GAAP. The results for the interim period ended December 31, 2022
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending September 30, 2023.
The
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and
a consolidated variable interest entity (“VIE”). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Item
9 Labs consolidates a VIE in which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  An entity is generally a VIE if it meets
any of the following criteria: (i) the entity has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties, (ii) the equity investors cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations
or (iii) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity
or receive the expected returns of the entity and substantially all of the entity’s activities involve or are conducted on behalf
of the investor with disproportionately few voting rights. The Company makes significant judgments in determining whether an entity is
a VIE and, for each reporting period, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
Effective
February 1, 2022, the Company was deemed the primary beneficiary of Elevated Connections, Inc. The equity in Elevated Connections, Inc.
held by its stockholder has been presented on the balance sheet and the statement of operations as a non-controlling interest.
Certain
prior period balances have been reclassified in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current
period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the prior periods’ net loss or accumulated deficit.
F- 6
Accounting
Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates of the Company include but are not limited to accounting for depreciation and amortization, current and deferred
income taxes, inventory, accruals and contingencies, carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, the fair value of common stock
and the estimated fair value of stock options and warrants. Due to the uncertainties in the formation of accounting estimates, and the
significance of these items, it is reasonably possible that these estimates could be materially changed in the near term.
Inventory
Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on the first in first out method. Inventory primarily
consists of the costs directly related to the production and cultivation of cannabis crops, cannabis oils, and cannabis concentrate products.
Inventory is relieved to cost of revenues as products are delivered to dispensaries. Inventory consists primarily of labor, utilities,
costs of raw materials, packaging, nutrients and overhead.
The Company routinely evaluates
the carrying value of inventory for slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory and, when appropriate, will record an adjustment to
reduce inventory to its estimated net realizable value.
Revenue
Recognition
Cultivation
revenue
The
core principle of ASC 606 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC
606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle, including identifying the contract with the customer, identifying the
performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, including estimating the amount of variable consideration
to include in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and recognizing revenue
when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
All
of the Company's cultivation revenue is associated with a customer contract that represents an obligation to provide cannabis products
that are delivered at a single point in time.  For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 96% and 99%, respectively,
of the Company's net revenue was generated from performance obligations completed in the state of Arizona.
The
Company recognizes revenue once the products are delivered. Revenue is considered earned upon successful delivery of the product to the
dispensary as the Company has no further performance obligations at this point in time and collection is reasonably assured. The Company
records revenue at the amount it expects to collect, 100% of the wholesale sales. Beginning April 1, 2020, the Company entered into a
three-year agreement with a dispensary, which calls for monthly payments of $40,000 to be paid by the Company. The fees paid for operating
under the contract are expensed to cost of revenues.
The
Company's revenues accounted for under ASC 606 do not require significant estimates or judgments based on the nature of the Company's
revenue stream. The sales price is generally fixed at the point of sale and all consideration from the contract is included in the transaction
price. The Company's contracts do not include multiple performance obligations, variable consideration, a significant contract, rights
of return or warranties.
Franchising
revenue
The
Company enters into franchise agreements and consulting agreements. The franchise agreement allows the franchisee to, among other things,
establish a franchised outlet under the Company’s Unity Rd. brand. Under the consulting agreements, the Company assists customers
with applying for and being awarded a retail cannabis license through the state license application process. The initial franchise fee
and the consulting fee are due upon execution of the related agreement. These payments are deferred on the condensed consolidated balance
sheet. The initial franchise fee is recognized into revenue ratably over the term of the agreement and the consulting fee is recognized
at the time the performance obligation has been satisfied. Revenue recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
that was included in deferred revenue at September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $54,998 and $4,998, respectively.

Net
Loss Per Share
Basic
net loss per share does not include dilution and is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could
share in the losses of an entity. Dilutive securities are not included in the weighted average number of shares when inclusion would
be anti-dilutive. The following table summarizes the securities outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 that were excluded from the
diluted net loss per share calculation for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 because the effect of including these potential
shares was antidilutive due to the Company’s net loss.

Warrants,
Conversion Options, Debt Discounts and Amendments
The
Company analyzes warrants issued with debt to determine if the warrants are required to be bifurcated and accounted for at fair value
at each reporting period. When bifurcation is not required, the Company records a debt discount, based on the relative fair values of
the warrants and the debt, with a corresponding charge to equity unless the terms of the warrant require it to be classified as a liability.
The warrants and corresponding note discounts are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model uses estimates of volatility,
risk free interest rate and the expected term of the warrants, along with the current market price of the Company's stock, to estimate
the value of the outstanding warrants. The Company estimates the expected term using an average of the contractual term and vesting period
of the award. The expected volatility is measured using the average historical daily changes in the market price of the Company's common
stock over the expected term of the award or, if earlier, since March 20, 2018, the day of the merger between BSSD Group LLC ("BSSD")
and Airware Labs Corp, and the risk-free interest rate is equivalent to the implied yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds with a remaining
maturity equal to the expected term of the awards.
The
Company also analyzes conversion options embedded with debt to determine if the conversion options are required to be bifurcated and
accounted for at fair value at each reporting period or to determine if there is a beneficial conversion feature. At December 31, 2022
and September 30, 2022, none of the conversion options embedded in the Company’s debt were required to be bifurcated.
The
Company analyzes the terms of its debt amendments to determine if the changes made to the terms have affected the debt’s cash flows.
If the debt’s cash flows have been affected, the Company then determines if the amendment should be accounted for as a troubled
debt restructuring, an extinguishment or a modification and the appropriate accounting model is applied.
F- 8
Segment
Reporting
The
Company defines operating segments as components about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company allocates its resources
and assesses the performance of its sales activities based on the services performed by its subsidiaries. For the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has identified two segments: the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis and cannabis derived
products and technologies (“Cultivation”) and the sales of Unity Rd. franchises to dispensaries (“Franchising”).
Held
for sale
The
Company classifies long-lived assets or disposal groups and related liabilities as held-for-sale when management having the appropriate
authority, generally our Board of Directors or certain of our Executive Officers, commits to a plan of sale, the disposal group is ready
for immediate sale, an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated and the sale is probable and expected to be completed within
one year. Once classified as held-for-sale disposal groups are valued at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated
selling costs. Depreciation on these properties, if placed into service, is discontinued at the time they are classified as held for
sale.
Employer
Retention Credit
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company received $952,805 of tax credits in accordance with the Employer Retention Credit
(“ERC”) program, authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended. The Company’s
policy is to account for the ERC as a grant using guidance analogous to government grants found in IAS 20,  Accounting for Government
Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance.  In accordance with this guidance, the ERC is recognized as a reduction to Payroll
and employee related expenses on the statement of operations when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will receive the ERC.
Leases
The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets and current and long-term operating lease liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We currently do not have any
material finance lease arrangements.
Operating
lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease
term at commencement date. Generally, our leases do not provide an implicit rate. As such, we use our incremental borrowing rate in effect
at the commencement date of the lease in determining the present value of future payments.
When
we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset,
and if it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement
of the lease.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Pending
Adoption
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which provides guidance on
measuring credit losses on financial instruments. The amended guidance replaces current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing
credit losses when a loss is probable with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a broader range of reasonable
and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company on October 1, 2023, with early
adoption permitted on October 1, 2019. We are assessing the provisions of this amended guidance; however, the adoption of the standard
is not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,  Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
– Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).  This standard eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash
conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity’s own
equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, the new guidance modifies
how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation.
For public business entities, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies, it is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years using the fully retrospective or modified retrospective
method. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted
but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently
evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
F- 9
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers.
This standard requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination
to be recognized in accordance with Topic 606 as if the acquirer had originated the contracts. For public business entities, ASU 2021-08
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements
and disclosures.
There
have been no other recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted
that are of significance, or potential significance, to us.
Note
2 – Going Concern
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates continuation
of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating
costs and has incurred net losses since its inception. These losses, with the associated substantial accumulated deficit, are a direct
result of the Company’s planned ramp up period as it is pursuing market acceptance and geographic expansion. In view of these matters,
realization of a major portion of the assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations
of the Company which in turn is dependent upon the Company’s ability to meet its financing requirements, and the success of its
future operations. The Company operates in a new, developing industry with a variety of competitors. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need to generate additional revenue and obtain additional capital to fund its
operating losses and service its debt. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are described as follows:
Sales
and Marketing. Historically, the Company has generated the majority of its revenues by providing the products it produces to
dispensaries throughout the state of Arizona. The Company’s revenues have increased significantly since its inception in May
2017. Management will continue its plans to increase revenues in the Arizona market by providing superior products. Additionally, as
capital resources become available, the Company plans to expand into additional markets outside of Arizona. The Company believes
that it will continue reducing the overall costs of revenues and costs of revenues will increase at a lower rate than revenues in
future periods, which is expected to
lead to increased profit margins.
Financing.
To date, the Company has financed its operations primarily with loans from third parties and shareholders, private placement financings
and sales revenue. Management believes that with continued production efficiencies, production growth, and continued marketing efforts,
sales revenue will grow, thus enabling the Company to reverse its negative cash flow from operations and raise additional capital as
needed. However, there is no assurance that the Company’s overall efforts will be successful.
If
the Company is unable to generate additional sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company
could default on additional obligations and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if
no other means of financing operations are available. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other
adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

5 – Variable Interest Entity
In
January 2022, the Company signed a Co-Management Agreement with a dispensary in Oklahoma for a term of three years. Under the terms of
the Co-Management Agreement, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of a dispensary, excluding cannabis and cannabis related
products and licenses, and assumed the dispensary’s lease. Further, under the Co-Management Agreement, the Company is to operate,
staff, and otherwise manage the day-to-day operations of the dispensary. The Company shall also pay all claims, costs and liabilities
associated with operating the dispensary.
The
terms of the Co-Management Agreement provide the Company with, in its judgment, the ability to manage and make decisions that most significantly
affect the operations of Elevated Connections and to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to Elevated Connections. As
such, the Company has consolidated Elevated Connections effective February 1, 2022. The purpose of Elevated Connections, as a licensed
dispensary, is to hold the cannabis and cannabis related products and licenses of the dispensary.
The
assets of the VIE cannot be used to settle obligations of the Company or its wholly owned subsidiaries. However, liabilities recognized
as a result of consolidating the VIE does represent additional claims on the Company’s general assets.

of the Company's gross revenues from the Arizona operations until the loan was repaid, 2% until repaid 200% of the amount loaned, and
1% of gross revenues in perpetuity or until a change in control. The loan was originally collateralized with a Deed of Trust on the Company's

8 - Concentrations
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 96% and 99%, respectively, of the Company's revenue was generated from a single customer.
Given the agreement with the license holder, although the Company’s products are distributed to numerous dispensaries throughout
Arizona, all sales are made through the license holder. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary provides cannabis products to this customer
under a three-year Cultivation Management Services Agreement that commenced on April 1, 2020. Provisions of the agreement require 30-day
written notice to terminate except for the following circumstances, in which case the agreement is cancellable with no notice: (i) uncured
default; (ii) gross negligence, intentional, or willful misconduct by either party; (iii) federal or state enforcement action against
either party; (iv) any change or revocation of state or local law that has the effect of prohibiting the legal operation of the Cultivation
Facility; (v) the dispensary license renewal is not approved; (vi) the dispensary fails to maintain its dispensary license in good standing
with the regulators resulting in the revocation of the dispensary license. Two of our license holder’s customers that the Company’s
products are distributed to account for approximately 46% and 11%, respectively, of our cultivation revenue for the three months ended
December 31, 2022. Should our products no longer be distributed to these customers of our license holder, it would have a material adverse
effect on our operations.
Note
9 - Commitments and Contingencies
The
production and possession of cannabis is prohibited on a national level by the Controlled Substances Act, though the state of Arizona
allows these activities to be performed at licensed facilities such as BSSD. If the federal government decides to change its policy on
the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Revenues
The decrease in revenue for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the effects of the Arizona cannabis market stabilizing, causing price compression, as
well as the Company’s addition of product lines with lower unit sales prices. The impact of the changing market conditions in
Arizona was countered by a significant increase in the number of units sold during the quarter compared to the same quarter in the
previous year.
Cost
of Revenues
Cost
of revenues consist primarily of labor, materials, supplies and utilities. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 48% for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 61% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This is primarily the result of decreases
in the unit costs the Company pays for materials resulting from additional competition in material suppliers. Management will remain
focused on reducing costs through bulk purchasing, implementing additional efficiencies in production and making additional investments
in property and equipment. The Company believes that it will reduce the overall cost of revenues and cost of revenues will increase at
a lower rate than revenues in future periods, which will lead to increased profit margins.
Gross
Profit
The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to decreases in cost of revenue being greater than the decreases in revenue. As
the Company experienced decreases in its unit sales price due to increased competition, so too did the Company’s suppliers, though
the decreased costs have proven to be greater than the decreased unit sales prices. As a result, and given the production efficiencies
achieved in previous quarters, the Company has been able to increase gross profit on decreased revenues. With the Company’s continued
efforts to increase capacity and focus on efficiencies and reducing costs, management expects gross profit to increase going forward.
Operating
Expenses
Professional
fees and outside services increased for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021
primarily due to the amount accrued for consulting services received related to the Company’s employee retention credits and legal
fees incurred on the pending Sessions acquisition. The increase in consulting services was offset by a decrease in stockholder administration
services.
Payroll
expenses were consistent when comparing the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021. Payroll
and employee related expenses increased as a result of an accrual for expenses incurred related to our change in Chief Executive Officer
and an increase in stock compensation expense. These additional expenses were offset by the Employee Retention Credits ("ERCs")
received during the current quarter.
Sales
and marketing expenses decreased due to a decrease of promotional items and a general decrease in spending on third party marketing vendors
during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
The
decrease in depreciation and amortization is due primarily to a decrease in amortization expense as a result of the intangible asset
impairment recorded during the year ended September 30, 2022.
Other
operating expenses decreased primarily due to the reversal of penalties and interest on previously unpaid payroll taxes as a result of
receiving the ERCs during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of gross profit
decreased from 189% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 160% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Management believes
this ratio will decrease for profit center segments going forward as the expectation is that revenues will grow at a higher rate than
operating expenses.
Other
Expense, net
Other
expenses consist primarily of interest expense of $1,661,853 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $1,210,390 for the three
months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of the interest expense and amortization of
discounts on the debt financing the Nevada construction. The interest and discount amortization expense related to the Nevada construction
debt was capitalized into construction in progress during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. As the Nevada expansion is substantially
complete, the related interest and discount amortization are recorded to interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Adjusted
EBITDA
Management
uses the non-GAAP measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-related compensation expense, acquisition-related
costs, employee retention credits and other adjustments, or “Adjusted EBITDA,” to evaluate the Company’s performance.  Adjusted
EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the market
value of companies considered to be in similar businesses. The Company suggests that Adjusted EBITDA be viewed in conjunction with its
reported financial results or other financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, or “US GAAP.”
The
following table reflects the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
Company’s primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of its business, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
debt service, and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s primary source of liquidity is funds generated from revenues, financing
activities and from private placements. The Company’s ability to fund its operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to
make planned acquisitions, to make scheduled debt payments, and to repay or refinance indebtedness depends on its future operating performance
and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond
the Company’s control.
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates continuation
of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating
costs and has incurred net losses since its inception. These losses, with the associated substantial accumulated deficit, are a direct
result of the Company’s planned ramp up period as it is pursuing market acceptance and geographic expansion. In view of these matters,
realization of a major portion of the assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations
of the Company which in turn is dependent upon the Company’s ability to meet its financing requirements, and the success of its
future operations. The Company operates in a new, developing industry with a variety of competitors. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need to generate additional revenue and obtain additional capital to fund its
operating losses and service its debt. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are described as follows:
Sales
and Marketing. Historically, the Company has generated the majority of its revenues by providing the products it produces to
dispensaries throughout the state of Arizona. The Company’s revenues have increased significantly since its inception in May
2017. Management will continue its plans to increase revenues in the Arizona market by providing superior products. Additionally, as
capital resources become available, the Company plans to expand into additional markets outside of Arizona. The Company believes
that it will continue reducing the overall costs of revenues and costs of revenues will increase at a lower rate than revenues in
future periods, which is expected to
lead to increased profit margins.
Financing.
To date, the Company has financed its operations primarily with loans from third parties and shareholders, private placement financings
and sales revenue. Management believes that with continued production efficiencies, production growth, and continued marketing efforts,
sales revenue will grow, thus enabling the Company to reverse its negative cash flow from operations and raise additional capital as
needed. However, there is no assurance that the Company’s overall efforts will be successful.
26
If
the Company is unable to generate additional sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company
could default on additional obligations, and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if
no other means of financing operations are available. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other
adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had $21,781 of cash and cash equivalents and negative working capital of ($43,728,770) (current assets
minus current liabilities), compared with $85,637 of cash and cash equivalents and negative working capital of ($37,032,478) as of September
30, 2022. The decrease of $6,696,292 in the Company’s working capital is primarily due to increases in the amount of the Company’s
debt maturing within the next 12 months. The decrease is also due to decreases in the Company’s inventory and prepaid balances
and increases in the Company’s other operating liabilities. The $63,856 decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due
to the net cash used in operating activities offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt. The Company is an early-stage growth company.
It is generating cash from sales and is investing its capital reserves in current operations and new acquisitions that are expected to
generate additional earnings in the long term. The Company expects that its cash on hand and cash flows from operations, along with private
and/or public financing, will be adequate to meet its capital requirements and operational needs for the next 12 months, although no
assurance can be given that private and/or public financing can be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.

We
intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through the use of the cash we have on hand and through business operations,
future equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares.
We are also in discussions with various potential capital partners to provide additional debt capital for accretive acquisitions. We
do not have any other arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings of debt and equity. There is no assurance that
we will be successful in finding a capital partner to provide additional debt capital or any other such financings on terms that will
be acceptable to us.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
are not currently a party to, or otherwise involved with, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have
a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical
Accounting Policies
Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to
make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level
of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Critical accounting policies and estimates in these condensed
consolidated financial statements are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of options, warrants and debt discounts, carrying
value of intangible assets subject to amortization, infinite life intangible assets and goodwill, stock-based compensation, and income
taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, our observance of trends in particular areas, and information or valuations and
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts could differ significantly
from amounts previously estimated. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Part I, item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September
30, 2022. Management believes that there have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies during the three months ended
December 31, 2022.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with
the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange
Act"). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022.
Identified
Material Weaknesses
A
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
Management
identified the following material weaknesses during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, which are primarily
due to the size of the Company and available resources:
•
lack
of properly controlled segregation of duties
•
lack
of risk assessment procedures on internal control to detect financial reporting risks in a timely manner; and
•
lack
of documentation on policies and procedures that are critical to the accomplishment of financial reporting objectives.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, which were
identified in connection with our management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations
of the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls
Our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
The
design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS
From
time to time, the Company may become subject to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business.
Although the Company cannot accurately predict the amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters,
it makes provision for potential liabilities when it deems them probable and reasonably estimable. These provisions are based on current
information and legal advice and may be adjusted from time to time according to developments.
