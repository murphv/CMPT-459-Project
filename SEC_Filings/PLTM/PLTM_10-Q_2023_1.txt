1.
Organization
GraniteShares
Platinum Trust (the “Trust”) is an investment trust formed on January 11, 2018 under New York law pursuant to a trust indenture.
The Sponsor of the Trust, GraniteShares LLC (the “Sponsor”), is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the performance
of The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Trustee”) and the Trust’s principal service providers, including the preparation
of financial statements. The Trustee is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust.
The
objective of the Trust is for the value of the Shares to reflect, at any given time, the value of the assets owned by the Trust at that
time less the Trust’s accrued expenses and liabilities as of that time. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective
means of making an investment similar to an investment in platinum.
The
fiscal year end for the Trust is June 30.
Undefined
capitalized terms shall have the meaning as set forth in the Trust’s registration statement.
2.
Significant accounting policies
The
Sponsor has determined that the Trust falls within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 946, Financial Services—Investment Companies, and has concluded that for reporting purposes,
the Trust is classified as an Investment Company. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and is not required to register under such act.
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
those responsible for preparing financial statements to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.
2.1
Valuation of Platinum
The
Trust follows the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 provides guidance for determining fair
value and requires increased disclosure regarding the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. ASC 820 defines fair
value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date.
Platinum
is held by ICBC Standard Bank Plc (the “Custodian”), on behalf of the Trust, at the Custodian’s London, United Kingdom
vaulting premises. The cost of platinum is determined according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the London
Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”) Platinum Price PM.
LBMA
Platinum Price PM is the price per troy ounce of platinum, stated in U.S. dollars, determined by the LME, following an auction process
starting after 2:00 p.m. (London time), on each day that the London platinum market is open for business, and announced by the LME shortly
thereafter.
The
per Share amount of platinum exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee, using the LBMA Platinum Price
PM to calculate the platinum amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering platinum sales have not yet been made, and represents
the per Share amount of platinum held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses and liabilities and any
losses that may have occurred.
8
ASC
820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs are
as follows:
Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access.
Level
2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar
data.
Level
3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Trust’s
own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based
on the best information available.
The
Trustee categorizes the Trust’s investment in platinum as a level 1 asset within the ASC 820 hierarchy.
2.2
Expenses, realized gains and losses
The
Trust’s only ordinary recurring fee is expected to be the fee paid to the Sponsor, which will accrue daily at an annualized rate
equal to
0.50 % of the adjusted daily net asset value of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears.
The
Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee’s monthly fee and
out of pocket expenses, the Custodian’s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian’s expenses, exchange listing fees, United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and certain
legal expenses.
As
of December 31, 2022, the fees payable to the Sponsor were $ 19,040 . As of June 30, 2022, the fees payable to the Sponsor were $ 19,453 .
With
respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion,
sell the Trust’s platinum as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling platinum to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor
to sell the smallest amounts of platinum needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust’s holdings of assets other
than platinum. Other than the Sponsor’s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021.
Unless
otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling platinum the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the LBMA PM Platinum
Price. The Trustee will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the
most favorable price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such platinum only if the sale transaction is made
at the next LBMA PM Platinum Price or such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case as set following
the sale order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the cost of the platinum sold. Neither
the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale.
Realized
gains and losses result from the transfer of platinum for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade date
basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of platinum transferred. Gain or loss on sales of platinum bullion is calculated
on a trade date basis using the average cost method.
2.3
Platinum. Receivable and Payable
Platinum
receivable or payable represents the quantity of platinum covered by contractually binding orders for the creation or redemption of Shares
respectively, where the platinum has not yet been transferred to or from the Trust’s account. Generally, ownership of the platinum
is transferred within two business days of the trade date.
2.4
Creations and Redemptions of Shares
The
Trust issues and redeems in one or more blocks of
50,000
Shares (a block of
50,000
Shares is called a “Basket”) only to Authorized
Participants. The creation and redemption of Baskets will only be made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution
by the Trust of the amount of platinum represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the
combined ounces represented by the number of shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order
to create or redeem Baskets is properly received.
9
Orders
to create and redeem Baskets may be placed only by Authorized Participants. An Authorized Participant must: (1) be a registered broker-dealer
or other securities market participant, such as a bank or other financial institution, which, but for an exclusion from registration,
would be required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions, (2) be a participant in DTC, and (3) must have
an agreement with the Custodian establishing an unallocated account in London or have an existing unallocated account meeting the standards
described herein. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Sponsor
and the Trustee. The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the
delivery of the platinum required for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures
attached thereto may be amended by the Trustee and the Sponsor, without the consent of any investor or Authorized Participant. A transaction
fee of $ 500
will be assessed on all creation and redemption transactions. Multiple Baskets may be created on the same day, provided each
Basket meets the requirements described below and that the Custodian is able to allocate platinum to the Trust Allocated Account such
that the Trust Unallocated Account holds no more than
192
ounces of platinum at the close of a business day.
Authorized
Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets will receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation
or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor
or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of shares.
2.5
Income Taxes
The
Trust is classified as a “grantor trust” for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will
not be subject to United States federal income tax. Instead, the Trust’s income and expenses will “flow through” to
the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trust’s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service
on that basis.
The
Sponsor has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined
that
no
reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
The
Sponsor evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Trust’s tax returns to determine whether
the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to
meet that threshold would be recorded as an expense in the current year. The Trust is required to analyze all open tax years. Open tax
years are those years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority.
As of December 31, 2022, the 2022, 2021,
2020 and 2019 tax years remain open for examination.
2.6
Emerging Growth Company qualification
The
Trust is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, and as such, is permitted to meet reduced public company
reporting requirements.

Related parties – Sponsor and Trustee
A
fee is paid to the Sponsor as compensation for services performed under the Trust Agreement. In exchange for the Sponsor’s
fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee’s
fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the custodian’s fee and reimbursement of the custodian expenses, NYSE Arca listing fees, SEC
registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and expenses, and up to $ 100,000
per annum in legal fees and expenses. The Sponsor’s fee is payable at an annualized rate of
0.50 %
of the Trust’s Net Asset Value, accrued on a daily basis computed on the prior Business Day’s Net Asset Value and paid
monthly in arrears.
The
Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsor’s Fee at its discretion for a stated period of
time. Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any part of its fee.
Affiliates
of the Trustee, may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell platinum or Shares for their own account, as
agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.
5.
Concentration of risk
In
accordance with Statement of Position No. 94-6, Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties, the Trust’s sole business
activity is the investment in platinum. Several factors could affect the price of platinum, including: (i) global platinum supply and
demand, which is influenced by factors such as production and cost levels in major platinum-producing countries, recycling, autocatalyst
demand, industrial demand, jewelry demand and investment demand; (ii) investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;
(iii) currency exchange rates; (iv) interest rates; (v) investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; and (vi)
global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. In addition, there is no assurance that platinum will maintain
its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of platinum declines, the Sponsor expects
the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately. Each of these events could have a material effect on the Trust’s
financial position and results of operations.
6.
Indemnification
Under
the Trust’s organizational documents, each of the Trustee (and its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents and affiliates)
and the Sponsor (and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates) is indemnified against any liability,
loss or expense it incurs without (i) gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or willful misfeasance on its part in connection
with the performance of its obligations under the Trust Agreement or any such other agreement or any actions taken in accordance with
the provisions of the Trust Agreement or any such other agreement and (ii) reckless disregard on its part of its obligations and duties
under the Trust Agreement or any such other agreement. Such indemnity shall also include payment from the Trust of the reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by the indemnified party in investigating or defending itself against any such loss, liability or expense or any
claim therefor. In addition, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, undertake any action that it may deem necessary or desirable in
respect of the Trust Agreement and in such event, the reasonable legal expenses and costs and other disbursements of any such actions
shall be expenses and costs of the Trust and the Sponsor shall be entitled to reimbursement by the Trust. The Trust’s maximum exposure
under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.
7.
Subsequent events

Introduction
The
Trust is a common law trust, formed under the laws of the state of New York on January 11, 2018. The Trust is not managed like a corporation
or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to
the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required
to register under such act. It does not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool, or subject to regulation
as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing Shares.
The
Trust holds platinum and is expected to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of platinum, and to distribute platinum in connection
with redemptions of Baskets. Shares issued by the Trust represent units of undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust.
The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of platinum, less the Trust’s expenses.
The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost-effective investment relative to traditional means of
investing in platinum.
The
Trust issues and redeems Shares only with Authorized Participants in exchange for platinum and only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares
or integral multiples thereof. A list of current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee.
Shares
of the Trust trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) Arca under the symbol “PLTM”.
Valuation
of Platinum; Computation of Net Asset Value
On
each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee evaluates the platinum held by the Trust and determines
the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV. The Trustee values the platinum held by the Trust using that day’s LBMA Platinum
Price PM. If there is no announced LBMA Platinum PM on a business day, the Trustee is authorized to use that day’s LBMA Platinum
Price AM. Having valued the platinum held by the Trust, the Trustee then subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of
the Trust from the value of the platinum and other assets of the Trust. The result is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee computes
the NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the date the computation is made.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes
to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor’s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the
Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor’s Fee.
The
Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust’s platinum as necessary to pay the Trust’s
expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell platinum to pay the Sponsor’s Fee but will pay the Sponsor’s
Fee through in-kind transfers of platinum to the Sponsor. At March 31, 2020 the Trust did not have any cash balances.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
The
Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust’s financial
position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust’s application of accounting policies. Below,
the Trust describes the valuation of platinum bullion, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important to understanding
its results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report
for further discussion of the Trust’s accounting policies.
Results
of Operations
The
Quarter Ended December 31, 2022
The
Trust’s net asset value grew from $39,246,142 on September 30, 2022 to $48,318,362 on December 31, 2022, a 23.1% increase. The
growth in the Trust’s net asset value over this period was due to an increase in the platinum price which increased by 23.26%
from $864.00 on September 30, 2022 to $1,065.00 on December 30, 2022. There was no net change in the number of shares
outstanding.
The
23.10% increase in the Trust’s net asset value per share, from $8.44 on September 30, 2022 to $10.39 on December 30, 2022 is directly
related to the 23.26% increase in the price of platinum.
The
Trust’s net asset value per share increased slightly less than the price of platinum on a percentage basis due to the
Sponsor’s fees, which were $54,808 for the quarter, or 0.13% of the Trust’s average weighted net assets of $43,488,436
during the quarter. The net asset value per share of $10.39 on December 30, 2022 was the highest during the quarter, compared with a
low during the quarter of $8.44 on October 02, 2022.

increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $9,112,352 resulting from an realized gains
on investment in platinum bullion of $9,176,282, decreased by (i) a loss of $9,122 on metal sold to cover the redemption orders and the
Sponsor’s fees and (ii) the Sponsor’s fees of $54,808. Other than the Sponsor’s fees the Trust had no expenses during
the quarter.

Months Ended December 31, 2022
The
Trust’s net asset value increased by 7.85% from $44,801,455 on June 30, 2022 to $48,318,362 on December 31, 2022. The increase
in the Trust’s net asset value occurred was the result of a change in the price of platinum, which increased 17.42% from
$907.00 on June 30, 2022 to $1,065.00 on December 31, 2022. The positive impact of platinum price on the Trust’s net asset
value was reduced by a 7.9% reduction in the number of shares outstanding from 5,050,000 on June 30, 2022 to 4,650,000 on December
31,2022.
The
17.14% increase in the Trust’s net asset value per share, from $8.87 on June 30, 2022 to $10.39 on December 31, 2022 is directly
related to the 17.42% increase in the price of platinum.
The
Trust’s net asset value per share increased slightly less than the price of platinum on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor’s
fees, which were $108,444 for the period, or 0.25% of the Trust’s average weighted net assets of $43,023,296 during the period.
The net asset value per share of $10.39 on December 30,2022 was the highest during the period, compared with a low during the period
