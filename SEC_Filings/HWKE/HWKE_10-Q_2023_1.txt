NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022   Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Business Overview   Hawkeye Systems, Inc. (the “Company”), a Nevada corporation incorporated on May 15, 2018. We are a technology holding company, our previous focus was on pandemic management products and services. We are currently seeking other opportunities, while actively trying to liquidate mask inventory and wind-up existing deals. The Company looks to license and acquire technology that improves life and to work with partners to develop cutting edge, “smart” products for a variety of markets. From inception until the date of this filing our activities have primarily consisted of (i) the incorporation of our Company, (ii) the development of our business plan and the evaluation of strategic investment and business development strategies, (iii), recruiting and adding additional consultants and employees, and (iv) liquidating our stock of personal protective equipment (“PPE”) products through numerous sources.   Basis of presentation   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.   In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on December 14, 2022.   Use of estimates   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions used for stock-based compensation, valuation of beneficial conversion feature on convertible notes and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.   Fair value measurements   When required to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used. The Company determines the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 uses significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. The amount of the total gains or losses for the period are included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date. The Company has no assets or liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis.     7 Table of Contents   Revenue recognition   As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company has no revenue.
Cost of sales   As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company has no Cost of Sales.
Basic and diluted earnings per share   Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, including stock options, warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock, and convertible note payable with accrued interest. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, potentially dilutive common stock equivalents not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive are as follows:       December 31,     December 31,       2022     2021   Warrants     2,393,996       2,493,996   Options     4,256,000       1,006,000   Convertible notes     56,792,686       32,250,000   Common stock payable     750,000       -   Total possible dilutive shares     64,192,682       35,749,996     Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued and their potential effect on our financial statements. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options” and ASC subtopic 815-40 “Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity”. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.   We early adopted this standard effective July 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective approach transition method. Therefore, the condensed financial statements for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are presented under the new standard, while the comparative period presented is not adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historical accounting policy.     8 Table of Contents   Note 2 - Going Concern   The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using GAAP, applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss of $ 481,388 . As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 11,363,564 .
The Company has not established sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs and will require additional capital to continue its operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.   In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan to obtain such resources for the Company includes: sales of equity instruments; traditional financing, such as loans; and obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimum operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing this plan.   There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.   Note 3 – Restatement of Financial Statements for the Quarter End December 31, 2021   On July 17, 2020, the Company entered into a membership agreement with Eagle Equities LLC (“Eagle”) and Ikon Supplies (“Ikon”) to form a Nevada Limited Liability Company, HIE, LLC (“HIE”) for the purpose of procuring, funding the purchase of and sale of PPE (the “Membership Agreement”). Subject to the provision of the Agreement, the interest of any net profits would be shared in a ratio of 33.3% among each member. Upon the occurrence of any loss in some or all of the HIE’s capital, all members would be responsible to contribute capital to repay the loan, and additional contribution, with each party being responsible for 33.3% of the loss.
Restatement Effect on Financial Statements   The Company did not receive any updates of the fiscal year 2021 financial statements from
HIE until October, 2022. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, HIE had a loan balance of $2,122,963 secured by Eagle, of which the Company has recognized 1/3 amounting to $707,654 as a guarantee of loan payable to Eagle - JV partner , the same amount as investment in HIE, as stipulated in the Membership Agreement. In addition, HIE incurred an operating loss of $ 1,385,962 , which resulted in the Company recording 1/3 of its loss of $ 461,987
under other expenses on the statement of income to offset the investment in HIE as under equity method in accordance with FASB ASC 323.   As of June 30, 2021, the balance of investment in HIE was $ 245,667
and the balance of loan payable to Eagle - JV partner was $ 707,654 . Since there were no operating activities or financial movement between July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, the investment in HIE and the loan payable to Eagle - JV partner are the same as of June 30, 2021.     9 Table of Contents   Effects on the previously issued year 2021 balance sheet referencing the restatement of asset, liability and equity are as follows:

Joint Venture Investment in HIE LLC
On July 17, 2020, the Company entered into a membership agreement with Eagle Equities LLC (“Eagle”) and Ikon Supplies (“Ikon”) to form a Nevada Limited Liability Company, HIE, LLC (“HIE”) for the purpose of procuring, funding the purchase of and sale of PPE (the “Membership Agreement”). Subject to the provision of the Agreement, the interest of any net profits would be shared
33.3 % among each member. If there is a loss in some or all of the capital, all members of HIE shall be responsible to contribute capital to repay the loan, and additional contribution, with each party being responsible for
33.3 % of the loss.
The joint venture investment in HIE LLC is accounted for by the Company using the equity method in accordance with FASB ASC 323. There were no operating activities in HIE during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the balances of investment in HIE were $ 0 , and $ 245,667 , respectively.
Note 5 – Inventory Financing Payable – related party   On February 19, 2021, Steve Hall, an investor who holds approximately 72% of the Company’s common stock advanced $1 million to the Company.
The purpose of the advance was to purchase inventory to satisfy customer orders. The advance would be repaid upon cash being received from the end customer. In addition to the principal amount of the advance, the related party will be entitled to 1/3 of the gross profit earned on the transaction. The terms of the agreement are non-interest bearing. The investor is 100% at risk as this is a non-recourse funding vehicle.     In June 2021 the Company cancelled the contemplated purchase of inventory and returned $ 500,000
to Mr. Hall. Mr. Hall has agreed to allow the Company to retain the balance to fund future purchases and general operating expenses.   On October 1, 2021, the Company and Steve Hall entered into an agreement to replace the inventory financing payable with a convertible note. Further discussion on Note 6 – Convertible Notes Payable – related party, convertible promissory note 6.3.
The balances of the convertible note as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 are $ 0
and $ 500,000 , respectively.

20 % per annum if repaid thereafter. The convertible note was due on April 6, 2021. At the option of the noteholder, the note would convert, at any time, starting six months from the date of issuance through to the one-year anniversary of the date of issuance at a conversion price of $ 0.25
per share.
The Company recorded a discount on the convertible note due to a beneficial conversion feature of $ 51,594 , which was being amortized over the term of the note.
In consideration for the loan of $ 250,000 , the Company also granted to Mr. Hall
100,000
stock options exercisable at $ 0.25
for a two-year term. The options vested upon issuance of the note. The fair value of the options was $ 13,297
and was recognized as debt discount as a part of beneficial conversion feature in the year ended 30, 2020.
The outstanding principal amount, and the related interest were converted into common stock on September 01, 2021.   Convertible Promissory Note 6.2   On December 15, 2020, the Company and Steve Hall, entered into a convertible promissory note agreement for the principal amount of $250,000, accruing simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum, if repaid within 90 days, and 20% per annum if repaid thereafter. The convertible note was due on December 15, 2021 . At the option of the noteholder, the note would convert at any time beginning six months after the date of issuance and ending on the date, which is one year from the date of issuance, at a conversion price of $ 0.25
per share.
The Company recorded a discount on the convertible note due to a beneficial conversion feature of $ 117,760 , which is being amortized over the term of the note.
In consideration for the loan of $ 250,000 , the Company also granted to Mr. Hall
100,000
stock options exercisable at $ 0.25
for a two-year term. The options vested upon issuance of the note. The fair value of the options was $ 46,380
and was recognized as debt discount as a part of beneficial conversion feature in the year ended June 30, 2021.
The outstanding principal amount, and the related interest were converted into common stock on September 01, 2021.   Adoption of ASU 2020-06 for Convertible Promissory Note 6.1, and Convertible Promissory Note 6.2   In connection with the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company reclassified the aggregate amount of $169,354, previously allocated to the conversion feature of the Convertible Promissory Note 6.1, and Convertible Promissory Note 6.2 of $51,594, and $117,760 from additional paid-in capital to convertible notes on our balance sheet as of September 1, 2021, respectively. The reclassification was recorded to combine the two legacy units of account into a single instrument classified as a liability. The Company also recognized an aggregate cumulative effect adjustment of $120,287 to the Convertible Promissory Note 6.1, and Convertible Promissory Note 6.2 of $51,594, and $68,693 to accumulated deficit on our balance sheet as of September 1, 2021, respectively. The cumulative effect adjustment was primarily driven by the derecognition of interest expense related to the accretion of the Debt Discount as required under the legacy accounting guidance. Under ASU 2020-06, we would no longer incur non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of the debt discount associated with the embedded conversion option.   Conversion of Convertible Promissory Note 6.1 and Convertible Promissory Note 6.2   On September 1, 2021, the Company had converted the convertible promissory note 6.1 and convertible promissory note 6.2 in the aggregate total of $500,000 and the related accrued interest of $94,344 into 16,666,667 shares of common stock with conversion value of $0.035661 per share. The entire amount of $594,344 has been converted into Common Stock on July 28, 2022. On November 2, 2021, the Company issued 160,000 shares of common stock for cashless exercise of the 200,000 stock options issued to Mr. Hall.
12 Table of Contents   Exercise of the stock options on Convertible Promissory Note 6.1 and Convertible Promissory Note 6.2   On November 2, 2021, the Company issued 160,000 shares of common stock for the cashless exercise of the 200,000 stock options, mentioned in convertible promissory note 6.1 and convertible promissory note 6.2.

Note 6.3   On October 1, 2021, the inventory financing payable of $500,000 with Steve Hall as mentioned on Note 5 – Inventory Financing Payable – related party, has been exchanged for a convertible promissory note with annual simple interest rate of 12% for the first 90 days and annual simple interest rate of 20% thereafter, with a due date on September 30, 2022 . At the option of holder, this note is convertible, at any time, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $ 0.02  per share.
The note’s maturity date was extended to September 30, 2023.   As of December 31, 2022, the accrued interest under the note was $ 115,342 , and the principal balance was $ 500,000 .   Note 7 – Line of Credit – related party   On October 1, 2021, Steve Hall
agreed to provide a line of credit of up to $1,000,000 to the Company with simple interest at a rate of 12% for the first 90 days, and simple interest at a rate of 20% per annum thereafter.

105,000 , and has accrued interest of $ 11,280 , and $ 962 , respectively.   As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the outstanding principal totaled $ 465,000 , and
105,000
with accrued interest of $ 52,184 , and $ 962 , respectively.

Based on our evaluation no material events have occurred that require disclosure.     15 Table of Contents   ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION   The following discussion relates to the historical operations and financial statements of Hawkeye Systems, Inc. for the six months ended December 31, 2022.   Forward-Looking Statements   The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report. The Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words “believe,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “target,” “estimate,” “expect,” and the like, and/or future-tense or conditional constructions (“will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation, those specifically addressed under the heading “Risks Factors” in our various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this quarterly report.   Financial Condition and Results of Operations   We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.   We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.   Results of Operations   Six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to six months ended
December 31, 2021   We had no operating revenues, and cost of sales, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Total operating expenses in the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $393,808 compared to $704,869 for the same period in 2021. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of decreased professional fees - related party, management compensation, and general and administrative expenses. The Company’s net loss was $481,388 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $768,757 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The net loss for this period is primarily a result of operating expenses, and interest expense.     16 Table of Contents   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our cash balance at December 31, 2022 was $32 compared to $14,488 at December 31, 2021. We do not believe these cash reserves are sufficient to cover our expenses for our operations for fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. We will require additional funding for our ongoing operations.   In addition, we intend to raise funds through the sale of equity and the exercise of warrants issued in private placements. Although to date we have had some warrant exercises for cash, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise money through offerings or through the exercise of warrants. If we cannot raise any additional financing prior to the expiration of the first quarter of 2023, we believe we will be able to obtain loans from management in the future, if necessary, but have no agreement in writing.   We are a smaller reporting company and have accumulated losses to date. Under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence, we believe we will require additional funds over the next 12 months to complete our regulatory reporting and filings. However, we will require maximum participation through private placements, warrant exercises or alternative financings to implement our business plan.   There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.   Plan of Operation and Funding   We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through equity offerings, warrant exercises, and related party advances in the near future. We have no guarantees or firm commitments that the related party advances will continue in the near future.
Existing working capital, further advances, together with anticipated capital raises are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in raising enough capital, or that we will receive the cash flow required to fund our operations. We have no lines of credit with banking institutions or other bank financing arrangements, we do have a line a credit form a related party (see Note 7 to the Financial Statements). Generally, we have financed operations to date through proceeds from the sale of our common stock, warrant exercises and convertible loans.   Management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses relating to: (i) developmental expenses; and (ii) legal and accounting fees, required to complete our filings with the SEC. We intend to finance these expenses with issuances of securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants.   Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue our operations.   Material Commitments   As of the date of this quarterly report, we do not have any material commitments.   Purchase of Significant Equipment   We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   As of the date of this quarterly report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.     17 Table of Contents   Going Concern   As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $11,336,564 at December 31, 2022 and net loss from operations of $393,808.   The Company does not yet have a history of financial stability. Historically, the principal source of liquidity has been the issuance of equity securities and related party advances. In addition, the Company is in the development stage and has accumulated losses since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.   The ability of the Company to continue operations is dependent on the success of Management’s plans and raising of capital through the issuance of equity securities, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.   The Company will require additional funding to finance its operations as well as to identify, negotiate and materialize a business combination with a target business. The Company believes its current available cash may be insufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   For a discussion of our accounting policies and related items, please see the Notes to the Financial Statements, included in Item 2.   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   Not applicable.   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.     Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In our review, we sought to find potential for material weaknesses in our financial controls, which is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in our accounting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.   Because of its inherent limitations, which include a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement, whether unintentional errors or fraud. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.   Our management, consisting of Corby Marshall as Chief Executive Officer and Christopher Mulgrew as Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(3) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), as well as the guidance provided in SEC Release 33-8809. In such evaluation, Mr. Marshall and Mr. Mulgrew assessed daily interaction, self-assessment and other on going monitoring activities as evidence in the evaluation. Furthermore we sought to identify financial reporting risks, identify controls that adequately address financial reporting risks, considered entity level controls, reviewed the role of technology in our controls and reviewed the evidence available to support the assessment.     18 Table of Contents   Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting on a timely basis information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and were not effective in assuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act due to material weaknesses including (i) the Company having only two officers handling all financial transactions, (ii) lack of appropriate operational controls and consistency in providing our accounting personnel with financial information, (iii) incomplete financial statements on a daily basis and resulting errors in our underlying accounting system, (iv) lack of proper documentation of our assessment and evaluation, and (v) our determination that internal controls were ineffective due to the limited segregation of duties because of the limited management structure.   In response to that assessment we have made a determination that all accounting and financial reporting services should be outsourced to a qualified consulting firm, and we immediately engaged a new financial services provider. We subsequently replaced that provider with an internal accounting contractor.   We have also made the determination that we need to dedicate more of the Company’s current and future financial resources to this function and engaged a permanent Chief Financial Officer.   This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permits us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    Other than engaging a new financial services firm to provide financial statements, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     19 Table of Contents   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1 - Legal Proceedings   On September 19, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Radiant Images, Inc., a California corporation (“Radiant”), as well as Radiant’s shareholder Gianna Wolfe (“Wolfe”) and key employee, Michael Mansouri (“Mansouri”), pursuant to which the Company would acquire 100% of the shares of common stock (the “Shares”) of Radiant from Wolfe, resulting in the acquisition of Radiant. In April 2020, the Company received notice from Radiant of their intent to terminate the Company’s acquisition agreement. Although the Company believes that the termination is not legally valid, the Company ceased further discussions with respect to the acquisition and engaged counsel to pursue litigation for repayment of amounts due by Radiant. The Company’s investment in Radiant was structured as a revolving note. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving note, Radiant is required to repay the money already invested to Hawkeye with interest. The note receivable was issued on April 26, 2019, is due upon demand of the Company at any time commencing April 26, 2020. The interest rate on the note is 12% and accrues daily on the outstanding balance. At June 30, 2020 interest income of $154,042 had been accrued on the note. Under accounting treatment, this note, and interest were impaired on our balance sheet while we resolved this dispute. We had filed a complaint against Radiant and its principals and intended to vigorously pursue this matter and litigation. The dispute was amicably resolved by the parties by means of a Settlement Agreement and Release of All Claims dated November 17, 2021, whereby the Company as “plaintiff” and “cross-defendant” released, and was in turned released, by Radiant, Gianna Wolfe and Michael Mansouri from any and all claims in connection with the stock purchase agreement and revolving note. No payment was due to or made by the Company in connection with the settlement and release of this action.
On November 13, 2019, 5W Public Relations LLC (“5W”) filed a complaint against Hawkeye Systems, Inc. relating to payments allegedly due under a contract for public relations services. Hawkeye vigorously disputed the allegations in the complaint as 5W Public Relations provided virtually no services to Hawkeye during the term of this arrangement but was paid a substantial amount of funds. Hawkeye engaged counsel to provide counterclaims for failure of consideration, fraud in the inducement, general fraud, and other causes of action. This proceeding was resolved by a Stipulation of Settlement dated May 19, 2022, filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The Company settled all of 5W’s claims for the sum of $30,000.    Other than the foregoing, we are not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this report, no director, officer, or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. We are not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.   From time to time the Company may be named in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, no legal proceedings or claims, other than those disclosed above, are pending against or involve the Company that, in the opinion of management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.   Item 1A - Risk Factors   Not required for Smaller Reporting Companies.   Item 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   No disclosure required.   Item 3 - Defaults Upon Senior Securities   No disclosure required.   Item 4 - Mine Safety Disclosure   No disclosure required.   Item 5 - Other Information   No disclosure required.     20 Table of Contents   Item 6 - Exhibits   Exhibits:   Number   Description       31.1*   Certification of Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to SEC Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a), adopted pursuant Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 31.2*   Certification of Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to SEC Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a), adopted pursuant Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 32.1*   Certification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
