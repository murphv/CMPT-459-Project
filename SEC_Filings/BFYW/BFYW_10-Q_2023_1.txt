Better
For You Wellness, Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business
Better For You Wellness, Inc. (we, us, our, the
“Company” or the “Registrant”) was originally incorporated with the name Fast Track Solutions, Inc. in the State
of Nevada on December 1, 2020.
On April 26, 2021, the Company entered into an
“Agreement and Plan of Merger”, whereas it agreed to, and subsequently participated in, a Nevada holding company reorganization
pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS 92A.200, NRS 92A.230 and NRS 92A.250 (“Reorganization”). The constituent corporations in the
Reorganization were Sauer Energy, Inc. (“SENY” or “Predecessor”), Fast Track Solutions, Inc. (“Successor”),
and Fast Track Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”). Our former director, Jeffrey DeNunzio, was the sole director/officer of each
constituent corporation in the Reorganization.
Fast Track Solutions, Inc. issued
1,000
common
shares of its common stock to Predecessor and Merger Sub issued
1,000
shares of its common stock to Fast Track Solutions, Inc. immediately
prior to the Reorganization. As such, immediately prior to the merger, Fast Track Solutions, Inc. became a wholly owned direct subsidiary
of Sauer Energy, Inc. and Merger Sub became a wholly owned and direct subsidiary of Fast Track Solutions, Inc.
Pursuant to the above, on April 26, 2021, Sauer
Energy, Inc. filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State. The merger became effective on May 5, 2021, at 4:00 PM EST (“Effective
Time”). At the Effective Time, Predecessor was merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger), and Predecessor became the surviving
corporation. Each share of Predecessor common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Fast Track Solutions, Inc.’s (“Successors”) common stock.
Fast Track Solutions, Inc., as successor issuer
to Sauer Energy, Inc., continued to trade in the OTC MarketPlace under the previous ticker symbol “SENY” until the new ticker
symbol “FTRK” for the Company was released into the OTC MarketPlace on May 6, 2021. The Company was given a new CUSIP Number
by CUSIP Global Services for its common stock of 31188W108.
The Company believes that the Reorganization,
deemed effective on May 5, 2021, was not a transaction of the type described in subparagraph (a) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act
of 1933 and the consummation of the Reorganization will not be deemed to involve an “offer”, “offer to sell”,
“offer for sale” or “sale” within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Reorganization
was consummated without the vote or consent of the Company’s stockholders. In addition, the provisions of NRS 92A.180 did not provide
a stockholder of the Company with appraisal rights in connection with the Reorganization. The Company believes that in the absence of
any right of any of the Company’s stockholders to vote with respect to the Reorganization or to insist that their shares be purchased
for fair value, the Reorganization could not be deemed to involve an “offer” “offer to sell”; or “sale”
within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.”
On May 5, 2021, after the completion of the Holding
Company Reorganization, we canceled all of the stock we held in Sauer Energy, Inc., resulting in Sauer Energy, Inc. as a stand-alone company.
Pursuant to the holding company merger agreement and effects of merger, all of the assets and liabilities, if any, remain with Sauer Energy,
Inc. after the Reorganization. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the Director of Sauer Energy, Inc., did not discover any assets of Sauer Energy, Inc.
from the time he was appointed Director until the completion of the Reorganization and subsequent separation of Sauer Energy, Inc. as
a stand-alone company.
Given that the former business plan and objectives
of Sauer Energy, Inc. and the business plan and objectives of Fast Track Solutions, Inc. substantially differed from one another, we conducted
the corporate separation with Sauer Energy, Inc. immediately after the effective time of the Reorganization in order to avoid any shareholder
confusion. The former business plan of Sauer Energy, Inc. (the development and marketing of wind powered electric generators) under the
leadership of its former directors, did not, in any way, represent the blank check business plan of Fast Track Solutions, Inc. at that
time, and thus it is the belief of the Company that the corporate separation ameliorated shareholder confusion about our identity and/or
corporate objectives. It is our belief that Sauer Energy was a shell company at the time of the Reorganization.
5
The corporate actions taken by the Company, including,
but not limited to, the corporate structuring of the transactions, was deemed, in the discretion of our sole director, to be for the benefit
of the corporation and its shareholders. Former shareholders of Sauer Energy, Inc. were then the shareholders of Fast Track Solutions,
Inc. and had the opportunity to benefit from a business combination with another company. The Company intended to serve as a vehicle to
affect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business at that
time.
After the reorganization and through July 18,
2021, CRS Consulting, LLC, a Wyoming LLC owned and controlled by Jeffrey DeNunzio, Thomas DeNunzio and Paul Moody, was our controlling
shareholder, owning
700,000
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
250,000,000
shares of Restricted Common Stock.
On July 19, 2021, Better For You Wellness, Inc.,
FKA “Fast Track Solutions, Inc.”, a Nevada Corporation (the “Company”), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement
(the “Agreement”) by and among CRS Consulting, LLC, a Wyoming Limited Liability Company (“CRS”), Green Ohio Ventures,
LLC, an Ohio Limited Liability Company (“GOHV”), Ian James, and Stephen Letourneau, pursuant to which, on July 30, 2021 (“Closing
Date”), CRS sold
700,000
shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock and
250,000,000
shares of Common Stock, representing
approximately
89.62 % voting control of the Company;
350,000
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were transferred to Ian James,
350,000
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were transferred to Stephen Letourneau, and
250,000,000
shares of Common Stock were transferred to
GOHV. The aforementioned purchasers, collectively, paid consideration of three hundred thirty-five thousand dollars ($ 335,000 ) (the “Purchase
Price”). The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement resulted in a change in control of the Company, with
GOHV, Ian James, and Stephen Letourneau, becoming the Company’s largest controlling stockholders having approximately
89.62 % combined
voting control over the Company.
Pursuant to the Agreement, on July 30, 2021, Mr.
Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and
Director.
On July 30, 2021, Mr. Ian James was appointed
as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Board of
Directors and Mr. Stephen Letourneau was appointed as a Director.
On August 18, 2021, we filed an amendment to the
Company’s Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name to Better For You Wellness, Inc. On September
30, 2021, we began trading under the symbol BFYW. The new CUSIP number associated with our common stock, as of the market effective date
of September 30, 2021, is 08771B105.
On August 24, 2021, Green Ohio Ventures, LLC transferred
17,963,817
shares of restricted Common Stock of Better for You Wellness, Inc. to MRKTS Group Inc. for consulting services provided. This
transaction did not result in MRKTS Group Inc. owning
5 % or more of any class of securities of the issuer.
From August 24, 2021 to August 25, 2021, Green
Ohio Ventures, LLC distributed, at no cost and in various quantities, a total of

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted. The condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of February 28, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but does not include
all disclosures required for audited annual financial statements. For further information, please refer to and read these interim condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 filed with the SEC.
Significant Accounting Policies and Use of
Estimates:
There were no material changes in the Company’s
significant accounting policies for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2022.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February
28, 2022, as filed with the SEC, for additional information regarding the Company’s significant accounting policies and use of estimates.
The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company’s financial
statements include estimates the valuation allowance associated with the Company’s deferred tax assets.
Revenue Recognition
The Company has prepared its unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The Company adopted ASC 606 - Revenue from contracts
with Customers: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the
transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each
performance obligation is satisfied.
Revenue for products is recognized when the products
are delivered to the customer, and the customer completes the product inspection. Cash receipts for undelivered products are recorded
as deferred revenues. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had no deferred revenues.
Basis of Presentation
This summary of significant accounting policies
is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These accounting policies
conform to accounting principles, generally accepted in the United States of America, and have been consistently applied in the preparation
of the financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at November 30, 2022
was $ 3,154
and $ 9,642
for February 28, 2022.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets
(primarily three to five years).
7
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC
740, “ Income Taxes .” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for
certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred
tax assets or liabilities were recognized at November 30, 2022.
Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes basic and diluted earnings
(loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,
Earnings per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or
equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
The Company does not have any potentially dilutive
instruments as of November 30, 2022 and, thus, anti-dilution issues are not applicable.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s balance sheet includes certain
financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively
short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.
ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ,
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market
data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three
broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
- Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally
from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
- Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement
and unobservable.
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based
upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of November 30, 2022. The respective carrying value
of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These
financial instruments include accrued expenses.
Related Parties
The Company follows ASC 850,
Related Party
Disclosures,
for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Share-Based Compensation
ASC 718, “ Compensation – Stock
Compensation ”, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services
are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments
such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period
(usually the vesting period).
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, “ Equity – Based Payments to Non-Employees.”
Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable:
(a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined
at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.
Except as specified for the Independent Directors’
compensation, the Company had no stock-based compensation plans as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 “Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU No.
2016-13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivables,
by replacing today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model under which allowances will
be recognized based on expected rather than incurred losses. ASU No. 2016-13 will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2023.
We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this update will have on our financial statements; however, it is not expected to be
material.
Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with
the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.
Note 3 - Going Concern
The Company’s financial statements are prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these
financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital deficiency,
and other adverse key financial ratios.
The Company has not established any source of
revenue to cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to capital. There is
no assurance that management’s plan will be successful. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the
event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.
Note 4 - Business Combinations
On April 29, 2022, we entered into an asset
purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Mango Moi. The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with
GAAP and was made to expand our market share in the personal care category and due to synergies of product lines and services
between the Companies. The acquisition closed May 26, 2022.
The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated
to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisitions
as follows:
Assets acquired:
Cash
$ 913
Inventory
12,995
Total
Assets Acquired
13,908
Liabilities assumed:
Clearbanc Debit Card
2,365

Total
Liabilities Assumed
5,494
Total identifiable net assets
8,414
Purchase price
592,000
Goodwill - Excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired on acquisition date
$ 583,586
The purchase price of $ 592,000  was paid in
stock and discharge of liability in cash as a combination. Goodwill in the amount of $ 583,586  was recognized in the acquisition of
Mango Moi LLC and is attributable to the cash flows of the business derived from our potential to outperform the market due to its existing
relationship and other synergies created within the Company.
9
As the Company finalizes the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, additional purchase price adjustments may be recorded. The finalization of the purchase accounting assessment
may result in changes in the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and may have an impact on the Company’s results
of operations and financial position.

Note 5 - Income Taxes
The Company has not recognized an income tax
benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income in future periods.
The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from the
net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future periods, tax benefits and related
deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not. As of November
30, 2022, the Company has incurred a net loss of approximately $ 4,105,379
which resulted in a net operating loss for income tax purposes.
The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately $ 862,130
at the effective statutory rate of
21 %. The deferred tax asset has
been offset by an equal valuation allowance. Given our inception on December 1, 2020, and our fiscal year end of February 28, 2022, we
have completed only two taxable fiscal years.
10
Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies
The Company follows ASC 450-20,
Los s
Contingencies,
to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and
penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be
reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of November 30, 2022 other than the following:
On September 17, 2021, our Board of Directors
unanimously approved to enter into and consummate a “Term Sheet” with Williamsburg Venture Holdings LLC, a Nevada limited
liability company (“WVH”). WVH is a multi-strategy, private investment fund located in New York. The Term Sheet is a private
placement with registration rights, providing WVH the ability to purchase up to $ 30,500,000
of our Common Stock. The term of the Term
Sheet is for
36
months. Following the execution of the term sheet, the Company is to pay WVH $ 15,000
to cover associated expenses relating
to, amongst other things, preparation of future securities agreements relating to the Term Sheet. Upon entering into definitive agreements
with WVH for the purchase and sale of equity, WVH is to immediately purchase $ 250,000
of the Company’s restricted common stock from
the Company at a
15 % discount to the last closing price of our Common Stock as reported by the OTC Markets Group. Any future proceeds
from the sale of shares, pursuant to the aforementioned term sheet, are to go towards the Company to be used for working capital. Pursuant

In exchange for
twelve months

services to the Company on a case-by-case basis, as may be requested by the Company.

twelve months
of access to the Sequire Platform, issued
1,250,000

On January 9, 2023, Anthony L.G., PLLC
replaced
Carter Ledyard Milburn LLP as the Company’s legal counsel going forward, to be consulted on a case-by-case basis. Any future legal
fees that may be incurred are to be billed hourly and may not be static. We believe legal counsel is important to the company’s growth
going forward. The Company seeks to retire the debt owed to Carter Ledyard Milburn by August 31, 2023.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements, other than purely historical
information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results,
and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.”
These forward-looking statements generally are
identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,”
“intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will
be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements are based on current
expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the
forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.
Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in
economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting
principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should
not be placed on such statements.
Company Overview
Business Overview
We are a sustainable brands and services company
headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. We are evaluating opportunities targeting six goals-based wellness categories within the rapidly growing
wellness industry to create a leading global wellness conglomerate.
Through our dual buy and build model, we evaluate
the wellness industry in the following six goals-based categories:
● Better Health
● Better Fitness
● Better Nutrition
● Better Appearance
● Better Sleep
● Better Mindfulness
As an early-stage company, our Company generated $6,986 and $0
in revenue for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 respectively. Our Company generated $9,008 and $0 in revenue for the
nine months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021 respectively. Our strategy is designed to offer wellness consumers a diverse synergistic
portfolio of brands and products that will allow them to live a life of intention and improve their quality of life.
We believe wellness consumers purchase with intention
and specifically seek out the brands and products that improve their quality of life. Furthermore, we believe wellness consumers pursue
these six goals-based dimensions of wellness and are positioning the Company to capitalize on this demand. With skin being humans’
largest organ, we have initially prioritized skincare and haircare to help wellness consumers look and feel better with clean and natural
products. We intend to expand into additional wellness categories with functional foods, beverages, supplements, and more.
Our management team brings deep expertise in heavily
regulated industries, operating, brand identity, genetics, and services, and raising capital to the public market. We seek synergistic
and complementary mergers and acquisition opportunities, implementing operational efficiencies to eliminate duplicative measures and centralize
administrative operations to achieve more significant revenues and profitability. Additionally, we expect to leverage our network of retail
relationships and acquire and manage brands and services cultivated in the beauty and wellness industry to secure sales in major retailers
in the United States and globally.
Our management team monitors various trends and
factors that follow, which could impact our operating performance.
As an early-stage company, the Company has relatively
few transactions to date.
15
Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Operating
Performance
Our management team monitors various trends and
factors that could impact our operating performance.
Revenue Strategy
— Our revenue growth
strategy follows a dual buy-and-build business model in which we acquire brands and related infrastructure and develop brands and related
infrastructure in-house. In addition to scaling the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Glow Market LLC, which currently owns and
operates our Better Suds soap brand, we have executed multiple non-binding letters of intent to acquire companies within the skincare
sector, including a vertically-integrated skincare manufacturer and multiple brands. The closing of these respective transactions depends
on numerous factors, including but not limited to the satisfactory completion of due diligence, capital constraints, and more. Furthermore,
any of these contemplated transactions would likely have a material impact on the Company’s operating performance. On May 26, 2022,
our Company closed its first acquisition of the right, title and interest in, including all of the outstanding membership interests of
Mango Moi, LLC, a hair and skincare business located in Chicago, Illinois.
Market Opportunity
We aim to become a major participant in the $1.5
trillion global wellness industry. We believe our innovative wellness-related offerings converge with wellness consumer trends and demands
for “Better-For-You” brands and products that can satisfy all pricing points. We expect consumer trends towards the adoption
of these healthier lifestyles to continue.
Competition
We will compete with companies that operate in
the plant-based and science-focused wellness market. Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial resources, a broader
market presence, longer-standing relationships with distributors, retailers, and suppliers, longer operating histories, more extensive
production and distribution capabilities, robust brand recognition, and significant marketing resources, and more comprehensive product
lines than us. We believe that principal competitive factors in this category include, among others, quality ingredients, wellness profile,
cost, convenience, branding, and marketing.
Sales and Marketing Costs
As we continue to grow our “BFYW”
product portfolio, we expect to expand our sales and marketing team by adding dedicated personnel to service additional retail customers.
Outside sales representatives and brokers may be added to expand our sales efforts. We further envision engaging, developing, and possibly
acquiring a subscription box retail operation. Marketing expenditures are expected to begin primarily online and in product fees (as we
engage retail store expansion), as well as other similar in-store marketing costs. These expenses will be categorized as net deductions
to revenue under GAAP instead of marketing expenses. We plan to hire a national marketing firm to implement digital video and display
campaigns, connected television, social media, and search engine marketing. As we expand and grow revenue, we will build a brand management
team (to support Management, who oversees all “BFYW” marketing efforts) to focus on digital marketing, social media, and other
marketing functions.
Operating Costs
Our operating costs include raw materials, labor,
related benefits, manufacturing overhead, marketing, sales, distribution, shipping, and other general and administrative expenses. We
attempt to manage the impact of our operating costs through fixed hourly rate agreements with legal counsel and certain consultants. We
have begun to reduce our labor force to right size the operations costs, as we reformulate the Mango Moi line of products for commercial
scaling.
Fluctuations in Costs
Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly
due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs, and our productivity efforts. If we are unable to manage cost fluctuations through
pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions, and consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross
margin, operating margin, and net earnings. Sales can also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact
on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve, and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization,
general overhead, workforce optimization, and outsourcing projects as deemed appropriate.
16
Commodities
In the future, our profitability could depend
on our ability to anticipate and react to raw material costs, among other things. Raw materials can be sourced from various parts of the
globe, and the prices of raw goods are subject to many factors beyond our control. These factors include variables in world economic conditions,
political events, tariffs, trade wars, or other events.
Acquisitions
The Company follows a dual buy-and-build business
model for growth through acquisitions and in-house development of brands. We have executed multiple non-binding letters of intent to acquire
companies within the skincare sector and functional beverage, women’s wellness and pet care. The closing of these respective transactions
depends on numerous factors including but not limited to the satisfactory completion of due diligence, capital constraints, and more.
Furthermore, any of these contemplated transactions would likely have a material impact on the Company’s operating performance.
Strategic Advisory Committee
To assist in the expansion of the Company, management
sought and received unanimous consent from the Board of Directors to create and seat a Strategic Advisory Committee composed of respected
industry leaders who bring relevant experience, networks, and leadership to the Company’s various initiatives.
Discussion of Financial Statement
As an Early-Stage
Company with few transactions, the Company’s expenditures were heavily Selling General, and Administrative (“SG&A”).
The Company engaged Anthony L.G., PLLC as legal counsel, to be consulted on a case-by-case basis as may be necessary for corporate legal
services and securities counsel. Payroll expenses, including deferred compensation, were the single largest category of cash expenditures
for the quarter.
Pursuant to their Employment Agreements, Ian James, Stephen Letourneau and Jacob Ellman have deferred compensation.
Accordingly, the following represents each individual’s deferred compensation since March 1, 2022: Ian James has deferred $141,197,
Stephen Letourneau has deferred $106,810, and Jacob Ellman has deferred $36,492. Both Mr. James and Mr. Letourneau have stipulated that
they will seek to convert at least 66% of their deferred compensation into restricted Common Shares at a $0.037 per share price to be
consistent with the Mast Hill per share pricing.
Management expects legal costs to taper as a percentage
of overall SG&A as the company grows. The Company’s SG&A further includes the cost of EDGAR and news release filing services,
payroll of a single person, website development and publishing, professional services such as accounting, SRAX for regular updates of
NOBO data for the shareholder lists for ongoing shareholder communications, Governmental filing fees including business licensing.
Systems and Controls
As an early-stage company, the Company has very
few transactions to date. The Company’s Board of Directors comprises 6 members, 4 of which are non-executive independent directors.
The Board of Directors’ reviews transactions, and the CEO signs off on transactions. The Company is developing revenue recognition
processes and procedures for the business, including revenue streams, point of performance obligation discharged, etc., to comply with
applicable State, Provincial, Federal, and International Laws and Regulations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our
unaudited
condensed
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“GAAP”). Under Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the
unaudited condensed
consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The Company adopted ASC 606 - Revenue from contracts
with Customers: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the
transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each
performance obligation is satisfied.
Revenue for products is recognized when the products
are delivered to the customer, and the customer completes the product inspection. Cash receipts for undelivered products are recorded
as deferred revenues. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had no deferred revenues.
17
Going Concern
The Company’s financial statements are prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these
financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital deficiency,
and other adverse key financial ratios.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.
The Company has not established any source of
revenue to cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to capital. There is
no assurance that management’s plan will be successful. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the
event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.
COVID-19
An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness
caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 spread globally in 2020. This outbreak resulted in travel restrictions, closed international
borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery,
prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, defaults, and other significant economic
impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.
The pandemic has not materially impacted our operations
in 2021 or 2022 thus far.
Financial Statements and Exhibits
The Company has been engaged in organizational
efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination. The Company’s business
purpose is to seek the acquisition of or merger with an existing company.
The Company is an “emerging growth company”
(“EGC”) that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act), which eases restrictions on the sale of securities; and increases the number of shareholders
a company must have before becoming subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC’s) reporting and disclosure rules
(See Emerging Growth Companies Section Below).
The Company has elected February 28th as its fiscal
year-end.

Revenues
The company generated $6,986 and $0 for
the
three months ended November 30, 2022,
and 2021 respectively, a increase of $6,986. The company generated $9,008 and $0 for
the
nine months ended November 30, 2022,
and 2021 respectively, a increase of $9,008. The increase was due to the Company having sales
from its Mango Moi operation.
Cost of Goods Sold
We recorded $5,823 and $0 for Cost of Goods Sold
for
the three months ended November 30, 2022,
and 2021 respectively, an increase of $5,823 .
We recorded $15,381 and $0 for Cost of Goods Sold for
the nine months ended November 30,
2022,
and 2021 respectively, an increase of $15,381 .
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
We recorded $1,163 and $0 in Gross Profit for
the three months ended November 30, 2022,
and 2021 respectively, a increase of $1,163. The
increase was due to the increase in sales and the streamlining of manufacturing. We recorded a negative $6,373 and $0 in Gross Profit
for
the nine months ended November 30, 2022,
and 2021 respectively, a decrease of $6,373.
The decrease was due to the reformulating and reconfiguring Mango Moi production over the period.
Operating Expenses
We recorded $605,163
and $1,066,097 in Operating Expenses for
the three months ended November 30, 2022,
and 2021
respectively. We recorded $2,184,659 and $1,152,153 in Operating Expenses for
the nine months ended
November 30, 2022,
and 2021 respectively.
We incurred $460,934 in lower Operating Expenses
for the three months ended November 30, 2022 due to approximately $346,762 in share-based expenses, and approximately $258,401 in general
and administrative expenses, compared to $532,243 and $533,854 in share-based expenses, and general administrative expenses, respectively,
for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The decrease in general expenses and administrative expenses was due to reduced stock option
expenses for Independent Directors with the vacancy of one Independent Board member, and reduction in legal fees, marketing expenses,
membership subscriptions, licenses, and software and applications.
Income Taxes
The Company has not recognized an income
tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income in future periods.
As of November 30, 2022, the Company has incurred a net loss of approximately $ 4,105,379
resulting
in a net operating loss for income tax purposes.  The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately $ 862,130
the
effective statutory rate of 21%. The deferred tax asset has been offset by an equal valuation allowance. Given our Company’s inception
date of December 1, 2020, and our fiscal year end of February 28, 2022, we have completed only two taxable fiscal years.
Net (Loss) Income
We recorded a loss of $659,935 and
$1,066,097 for
the three months ended November 30, 2022,
and 2021 respectively. We
recorded a lower net loss during this period compared to the same quarter of the prior year due to an reduced Operating Expenses
during the period. We recorded a loss of $2,191,032 and $1,152,153 for
the nine months ended
November 30, 2022,
and 2021 respectively. We recorded a greater net loss for our
third
quarter for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same quarter of the prior year due to an increase in Operating
Expenses.
19
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash balance was $3,154 and $0 as of November
30, 2022, and 2021 respectively. We received $0 and $0 from the sale of shares of Common Stock for the nine months ended November 30,
2022, and 2021 respectively. We presently are largely reliant on capital contributions towards expenses from Mr. Ian James, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. James loaned the Company $39,500 last quarter.
Our Audit Chairman, David Deming loaned the Company $145,000 in the three months ending November 30, 2022. Mr. Deming has indicated that
he plans to convert the loan into equity.
Mr. Ian James has
not guaranteed that he will continue to support our capital needs. Therefore, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. We may
require further funding to implement our operations plan for the next twelve months. Being a start-up stage company, we have a very limited
operating history. After a twelve-month period, we may need additional financing but currently do not have any arrangements for such financing
with the exception of the
Standby Equity Commitment Agreement with MacRab LLC .
If we need additional cash and cannot raise it,
we will either have to suspend operations until our Company raises the necessary financing or cease operations entirely.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including
special purpose entities.
Corporate History
Better For You Wellness, Inc. (we, us, our, the
“Company” or the “Registrant”), was originally incorporated with the name Fast Track Solutions, Inc. in the State
of Nevada on December 1, 2020.
On January 28, 2021, as a result of an Application
for Custodianship granted by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, styled as “In the matter of Sauer Energy,
Inc., a Nevada corporation, Case Number: A-20-826848-P”, Jeffrey DeNunzio was appointed Custodian of Sauer Energy, Inc. (the “Predecessor”).
On April 26, 2021, the Company entered into an
“Agreement and Plan of Merger”, whereas it agreed to, and subsequently participated in, a Nevada holding company reorganization
pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS 92A.200, NRS 92A.230, and NRS 92A.250 (“Reorganization”). The constituent corporations in the
Reorganization were Sauer Energy, Inc. (“SENY” or “Predecessor”), Fast Track Solutions, Inc. (“Successor”),
and Fast Track Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”). Jeffrey DeNunzio was the sole director/officer of each constituent corporation
in the Reorganization.
Fast Track Solutions, Inc. issued 1,000 common
shares of its common stock to Predecessor, and Merger Sub issued 1,000 shares of its common stock to Fast Track Solutions, Inc. immediately
prior to the Reorganization. As such, immediately prior to the merger, Fast Track Solutions, Inc. became a wholly owned direct subsidiary
of Sauer Energy, Inc. and Merger Sub became a wholly owned and direct subsidiary of Fast Track Solutions, Inc.
Pursuant to the above, on April 26, 2021, Sauer
Energy, Inc. filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State. The merger became effective on May 5, 2021 at 4:00 PM EST (“Effective
Time”). At the Effective Time, Predecessor was merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger), and Predecessor became the surviving
corporation. Each share of Predecessor common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Fast Track Solutions, Inc.’s (“Successors”) common stock.
Fast Track Solutions, Inc., as successor issuer
to Sauer Energy, Inc., continued to trade in the OTC MarketPlace under the previous ticker symbol “SENY” until trading under
the new ticker symbol “FTRK” for the Company began on May 6, 2021. The Company was given a new CUSIP Number
by CUSIP Global Services for its common stock of 31188W108.
On May 5, 2021, after the completion of the Holding
Company Reorganization, we canceled all of the stock we held in Sauer Energy, Inc. resulting in Sauer Energy, Inc. as a stand-alone company.
Pursuant to the holding company merger agreement and effects of merger, all of the assets and liabilities, if any, remain with Sauer Energy,
Inc. after the Reorganization. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the Director of Sauer Energy, Inc., did not discover any assets of Sauer Energy, Inc.
from the time he was appointed Director until the completion of the Reorganization and subsequent separation of Sauer Energy, Inc. as
a stand-alone company.
20
On July 19, 2021, Fast Track Solutions entered
into a Share Purchase Agreement by and among CRS Consulting, LLC, a Wyoming Limited Liability Company (“CRS”), Green Ohio
Ventures, LLC, an Ohio Limited Liability Company (“GOHV”), Ian James, and Stephen Letourneau, pursuant to which, on July 30,
2021, CRS sold 700,000 shares of the Fast Track Solutions’ Series A Preferred Stock and 250,000,000 shares of Common Stock, representing
approximately 89.62% voting control of Fast Track Solutions; 350,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were transferred to Ian James,
350,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were transferred to Stephen Letourneau, and 250,000,000 shares of Common Stock were transferred
to GOHV. The aforementioned purchasers, collectively, paid consideration of three hundred thirty-five thousand dollars ($335,000). The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Share Purchase Agreement resulted in a change in control of Fast Track Solutions,
with Ian James, Stephen Letourneau, and GOHV becoming the largest controlling stockholders.
Ian James and Stephen Letourneau retained a majority
of the membership interests (collectively constituting approximately 84.12%) of GOVH.
On July 30, 2021, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned
as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer. In addition, Mr. DeNunzio resigned as Director
on July 30, 2021. Mr. Ian James was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer,
and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Stephen Letourneau was appointed Director. The resignation of Mr. DeNunzio was not the result
of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies, or practices.
On August 18, 2021, a Certificate of Amendment
to change our name to “Better For You Wellness, Inc.” was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.
On August 27, 2021, Montel Williams, Leslie G.
Bumgarner, Joseph J. Watson, David H. Deming, and Dr. Nicola R. Finley, MD, were each appointed by our Board of Directors to serve as
Independent Directors of the Company.
On September 17, 2021, we entered into a “Term
Sheet” with Williamsburg Venture Holdings LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“WVH”). WVH is a multi-strategy,
private investment fund located in New York. The Term Sheet is a private placement with registration rights, allowing WVH to purchase
up to $30,500,000 of our Common Stock. The term of the Term Sheet is for 36 months. Following the execution of the term sheet, the Company
is to pay WVH $15,000 to cover associated expenses relating to, amongst other things, preparation of future securities agreements relating
to the Term Sheet. Upon entering into definitive agreements with WVH for the purchase and sale of equity, WVH is to immediately purchase
$250,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock from the Company at a 15% discount to the last closing price of our Common Stock
as reported by the OTC Markets Group. According to the aforementioned term sheet, any future proceeds from the sale of shares are to go
towards the Company to be used for working capital. According to the Term Sheet, WVH may not acquire, at any point, more than 4.99% of
our outstanding shares of common stock.
On September 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement
with SRAX, Inc., a Delaware Company (“SRAX”). Under the agreement with SRAX, the Company will be granted access to a platform
developed by SRAX, known as the “Sequire Platform” which, amongst other things, will allow the Company to access trading data.
According to SRAX, the platform is an investor intelligence and communications management platform that allows users to “unlock
stock buyers’ behaviors and trends for issuers of publicly traded companies”. In exchange for twelve months of access to the
Sequire Platform, we paid SRAX $20,000. Additional fees may be incurred as a result of this agreement, but we cannot accurately determine
what they may be, although we believe any such fees would be nominal.
On September 17, 2021, we entered into another
agreement with SRAX, whereas SRAX will provide advertising and marketing services to the Company on a case-by-case basis, as may be requested
by the Company.
On September 17, 2021, Mr. David H. Deming was
appointed Secretary of the Company’s Board of Directors.
On September 17, 2021, we engaged Carter Ledyard
Milburn LLP as the Company’s legal counsel going forward, to be consulted on a case-by-case basis. Any future legal fees that may
be incurred are to be billed hourly and may not be static. We believe legal counsel is important to the company’s growth going forward.
On September 30, 2021, we began trading under
the symbol BFYW. The new CUSIP number associated with our common stock is 08771B105.
On October 1, 2021, our Board of Directors unanimously
approved the establishment of an Audit Committee and appointed Montel Williams, David Deming, and Joseph Watson to the newly formed Audit

reasonable efforts to have the Initial Registration Statement and any amendment thereto declared effective by the SEC at the earliest

On August 31, 2022, BF
Borgers CPA PC (“BF Borgers”) furnished a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether BF Borgers
agrees with following statements:
● The Audit Committee (the “Committee”) of the
Company had conducted a competitive selection process to determine the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2023. The Committee evaluated several public accounting firms in this process, including BF Borgers,
the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. As a result of this process,
the Committee approved the appointment of GBQ Partners LLC (“GBQ”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2023. This action effectively dismissed BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm as of August 31, 2022.
24
● The reports of BF Borgers on the Company’s condensed
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer
of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. In connection with the audits
of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, and in the
subsequent interim periods through August 31, 2022, there were no disagreements with BF Borgers on any matters of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope and procedures which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BF Borgers,
would have caused BF Borgers to make reference to the matter in their reports. There were no reportable events (as that term is described
in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K) during the two fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, or in the subsequent periods through
August 31, 2022.
A copy of BF Borgers’
letter, dated August 31, 2022, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on August 31, 2022.
During the two most recent fiscal years and in
the subsequent interim periods through August 31, 2022, the Company has not consulted with GBQ with respect to the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that would have been rendered on the
Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, or any other matters set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) or (ii) of Regulation
S-K.
On September 20, 2022, the Company entered into
a Manufacturing Agreement with Ironwood Clay Company (ICCI) to develop commercially scaled Personal Care Products for Mango Moi and other
products in the Company’s portfolio. The Company agreed to pay a non-refundable deposit of $10,000 USD for up to 8 Product Formula.
This includes three formulation revisions and samples per Product Formula (each iteration of sampling of up to 500gr./ml.). Additional
revisions to the Formula(s) will be charges to the Client at a rate of $500 USD per revision.
Once the Company has approved the final Formula(s)
and places a Purchase Order exceeding $10,000 USD, the non-refundable deposit will be applied to the total amount of the Purchase Order.
Upon ordering at least Twenty Five Thousand US Dollars ($25,000 USD) of each Product Formula, the exclusivity granted to ICCI herein in
respect of such Product and Formula shall cease, the Company shall no longer be obligated to purchase Products from ICCI, and the Client
shall be free to engage any other manufacturer for such purpose.
On September 22, 2022, the Company announced the
cancelation of the Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire Ironwood Clay Company (ICCI) because ICCI was unable to have its Clay Mining Operation
adequately meet SEC reporting requirements related to the mining of a natural resource. Additionally, ICCI owners were unwilling to bifurcate
the Mining Operation from the Personal Care Manufacturing.
On September 22, 2022, the Company announced the

the Company’s premium coffee brand, which is now being sold through Amazon.com and is in discussion with major national retailers. The
e-commerce giant carries 8 of SJCCC’s premium coffee products and ships to more than 100 countries around the globe. Additionally, the

the Company to access trading data. According to SRAX, the platform is an investor intelligence and communications management platform
that allows users to “unlock stock buyers’ behaviors and trends for issuers of publicly traded companies.” In exchange
for twelve months of access to the Sequire Platform, we paid SRAX $30,000. Additional fees may be incurred as a result of this agreement,
but we cannot accurately determine what they may be, although we believe any such fees would be nominal.
Pursuant to the Company’s Compensation Committee

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK
As a smaller reporting company, as defined in
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item.
ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and our fractional Chief Financial Officer to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of November 30, 2022,
our management, with the participation of, and under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and fractional Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of November 30, 2022, due to the identification of a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of November 30, 2022.
As disclosed in the Company’s Current Report
on Form 8-K filed on March 3, 2023 with the SEC, on February 5, 2023, the Company’s management concluded that the following financial
statements should be restated and should no longer be relied upon:
(i)
The Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended May 31, 2022 included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 9, 2022 (the “Q1 2022 10-Q”); and
(ii)
The Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended August 31, 2022 included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on October 21, 2022 (the “Q2 2022 10-Q” and together with the Q1 2022 10-Q, the “Filings”).
The following errors impacted the Filings:
(i)
Incorrect itemization of accounts payable to reflect certain itemized expenses;
(ii)
Failure to include the rounding up of shares to reflect the correct total number of issued common stock;
(iii)
Failure to include certain accrued expenses to the accounts payable section;
(iv)
Incorrect calculation of closing dates regarding the reporting period for goods sold;
(v)
Incorrect calculation of closing dates regarding the reporting period for costs of goods sold;
(vi)
Incorrect statement of impaired expenses of $577,473 related to the acquisition of Mango Moi;
(vii)
Incorrect calculation of stock option agreements with Mast Hill and members of the Company’s Board of Directors;
(viii)
Incorrect calculation of selling, general and administrative operating expenses, which have been retranslated to comply with reporting standards under GAAP;
27
(ix)
Incorrect itemization of stock warrant expenses, reflected in the reitemization of $36,366;
(x)
Portions of the cash flow section of the financials did not meet GAAP standards;
(xi)
Omission of unaccounted depreciation in the financial statements; and
(xii)
Certain other incorrect calculations.
The Company has determined that the reporting
effects of the above errors had a material impact to the Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company for
the three months ended May 31, 2022, as reported in the Q1 2022 10-Q, and for the three and six months ended August 31, 2022, as reported
in the Q2 2022 10-Q. As a result, the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and the unaudited
consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended August 31, 2022 will be restated, and the Company will file an amendment
to each of the Q1 2022 10-Q and the Q2 2022 10-Q with the SEC.
Remediation of
Material Weakness
We are in the process
of implementing improvements and remedial measures in response to the material weakness, including the hiring of
a
fractional Chief Financial Officer with over 24 years of diverse professional experience in financial reporting and auditing under GAAP
and IFRS, with expertise in PCAOB audits. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with Aprari Solutions for accounting and audit-related
services. Established in 2018, Aprari Solutions is a leading audit and accounting firm in India with a team consisting of qualified CPAs,
Chartered Accountants, CFAs, Ph.D. and MBAs from top institutions, and experienced professionals well-trained in GAAP and PCAOB audit
standards and procedures.
Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting
Since September 1, 2022,
and in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of November 30, 2022, the Company has made changes
to its internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect our internal control over
financial reporting, including those changes set forth under “—Remediation of Material Weakness.”
Limitations on the effectiveness of internal
controls
In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its desired objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and
procedures relative to their costs.
Our management does not expect the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management overriding internal controls. The design
of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
