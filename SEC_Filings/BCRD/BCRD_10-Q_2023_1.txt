FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements”
for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial
items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed
new products or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements
of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements
are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our
future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks
and uncertainties.
Forward-looking
statements may include the words “may,” “could,” “estimate,” “intend,” “continue,”
“believe,” “expect,” “desire,” “goal,” “should,” “objective,”
“seek,” “plan,” “strive” or “anticipate,” as well as variations of such words or similar
expressions, or the negatives of these words. These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date
of this Form 10-Q. Except for our ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by the federal securities laws, we
do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on
any such forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions
prove incorrect, actual outcomes will likely vary materially from those indicated.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN
General
The
unaudited condensed financial statements of BlueOne Card, Inc. (“BlueOne” or the “Company”) as of December 31,
2022 and for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the years
ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. BlueOne (formerly known as Avenue South Ltd., TBSS International, Inc., or Manneking Inc.),
was incorporated on July 6, 2007 under the laws of the state of Nevada. The Company started its business as a retailer and importer of
domestic home furnishings from Hong Kong. The Company was engaged in gold mining and drilling and general construction, and changed its
name to TBSS International on September 30, 2011. On April 26, 2019, Corporate Compliance, LLC filed a re-application for custodianship
pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes NRS 78.347. The Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada, granted custodianship over
TBSS International, Inc. to Corporate Compliance, LLC. On October 15, 2019, the Company changed its name to Manneking Inc., and then
to BlueCard One, Inc. on June 30, 2020.
Risk
and Uncertainty Concerning COVID-19 Pandemic
In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic which continues to spread
throughout the United States and the World. We are currently monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related business and travel
restrictions and changes to behavior intended to reduce its spread. If the coronavirus continues to progress, it could have a material
negative impact on our results of operations and cash flow, in addition to the impact on its employees. We have concluded that while
it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative impact on the results of operations, the specific impact is not readily
determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
of Presentation
The
interim unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”), and include the accounts of the Company.
For purposes
of comparability, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
The preparation
of interim condensed financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that impact the amounts reported. The
interim condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible
for their integrity and objectivity. These interim condensed financial statements, reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim
periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021; however, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our audited annual
financial statements, as included in the Company’s interim condensed financial statements, have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to such SEC rules and regulations and accounting principles applicable for interim periods. These unaudited condensed financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on June 29, 2022. It is important to note that the Company’s results
of operations and cash flows for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and cash flows to be expected
for a full fiscal year or any other interim period.
5
Going
Concern
The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company has generated minimal revenues since its formation and has suffered operating losses since July 6, 2007 (Inception Date)
to date and allow it to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued
financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations, and the attainment
of profitable operations. The Company incurred a net loss of $ 679,535
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, used net cash flows
in operating activities of $ 283,907 , and has an accumulated deficit of $ 1,819,348
as of December 31, 2022. These factors, among others,
raise a substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate
capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The interim condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
related to the valuation of its assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and payable to related party. The Company bases its estimates
and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs
and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and
adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results,
future results of operations will be affected.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
The Company did
no t have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
Inventory
Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. The reported net value of inventory includes
saleable prepaid debit cards that will be sold or used in future periods. The Company reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there were
no
reserves established for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from
three
to
five years . Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter
of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets when they are placed into service. The Company evaluates property
and equipment for impairment periodically to determine if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the carrying value
of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Expenditures which
substantially increase the useful lives of the related assets are capitalized.
6
Long-lived
Assets
In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 360, “ Property, Plant, and Equipment ”, the
Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the
market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly
in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses
combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that
the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability
is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset compared to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss equal to the excess
of the carrying value over the assets fair market value is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows. The
impairment loss is recorded as an expense and a direct write-down of the asset.
No
impairment loss was recorded during the three months
and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Earnings
(Loss) Per Common Share
The
Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, “ Earnings per Share” . ASC 260 requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. The Company computes Basic EPS
by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator)
during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury
stock method and convertible note and preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price
for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options, warrants and convertible
preferred stock. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Leases
The
Company has operating leases for its offices. Management determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and whether
a contract is or contains a lease by determining whether it conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period
of time. If the contract provides the Company the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified
asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset, the Company consider it to be, or contain, a lease.
The
Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842,
Leases.
Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are
classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the condensed balance sheet as both a right of use asset and lease liability,
calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental
borrowing rate which is consummate with the respective lease term. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments
each period, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the
amortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.
In
calculating the right of use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted under
ASC 842. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy
election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
7
Fair
value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
ASC
820, “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”,
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company has established a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent,
objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value
hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into
three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are
observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. If the asset or liability has a specified
(contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The
Company’s financial instruments consist principally of prepaid deposits, accrued liabilities and customer deposits. The Company
believes that the recorded values of all the financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and
respective maturity dates or durations.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenues when the product is delivered to the customer, and the ownership/control is transferred. The Company’s
revenue recognition policy is based on the revenue recognition criteria established under the Financial Accounting Standards Board –
Accounting Standards Codification 606
“Revenue From Contracts With Customers ” which has established a five-step process
to govern contract revenue and satisfy each element is as follows: (1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in
the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as you satisfy a performance obligation. The Company records the revenue once all the
above steps are completed.
Stock-based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, “ Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees”
(“ASC 505-50”). The Company has established that equity-based payment transactions with
non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the
date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the
term of the contract.
The
Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 718, “ Compensation—Stock
Compensation”.
Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date
based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “ Income Taxes” .
The asset and liability method provide that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit
carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The Company records
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
8
The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, “ Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions .” When tax returns are
filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are
subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance
with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which,
based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is
more
than 50 percent
likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities
upon examination.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In
March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, “ Facilitation of the Effects of Reference
Rate Reform on Financial Reporting .” This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging
relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this ASU apply
only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference
rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply
to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect
the adoption of ASU 2019-12 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

Costs and Contingencies
In

If
a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonable estimated, the Company recognizes an expense for the estimated loss. If
the Company has the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, the Company makes a separate assessment
of recoverability and reduces the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable. The Company was not aware of any loss contingencies
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation
This
Quarterly Report Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a
result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the unaudited condensed financial statements
and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided
pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future

Overview
BlueOne
Card Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “ Company ”), through our relationship with our program manager, EndlessOne Global,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “ Program Manager ”), is a reseller of an all-in-one branded card with numerous user
benefits. Through our relationship with our Program Manager, we are a FinTech company aiming to provide innovative pay out solutions
and prepaid cards to consumers. Unlike other prepaid card distributors and companies, we specifically aim to target those who are unbanked,
or non-bankable and who have needs crossing international borders.
According
to the data from the Federal Reserve, there are an estimated 55 million adults currently residing in the U.S. who are unbanked or underbanked. 2
This means that about 17% of the entire U.S. population has difficulties utilizing the standard banking system. This is our target
group customers. Through our relationship with our Program Manager, we earn our revenues mostly through monthly fees charged to customers
for the issued general purpose reloadable (“ GPR ”) prepaid card, reloading fee, ATM withdrawal fee, and card to card
money transaction fee.
We
are currently headquartered in Newport Beach, California.
Background
BlueOne
Card, Inc. (formerly known as “Avenue South Ltd.,” “TBSS International, Inc.,” or “Manneking Inc.”)
was incorporated on July 6, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We started our business as a retailer and importer of domestic
home furnishings from Hong Kong. On September 30, 2011, we changed our name to TBSS International, Inc., which was engaged in gold mining
and drilling and general construction.
On
April 26, 2019 , Corporate Compliance, LLC filed a re-application for custodianship pursuant to NRS 78.347. The Eighth Judicial District
Court of Clark County, Nevada granted custodianship over TBSS International, Inc. to Corporate Compliance, LLC. On October 15, 2019,
we changed our name to “Manneking Inc.,” and then to “BlueOne Card, Inc.” on June 30, 2020.
On
June 30, 2020, we also executed a 1 for 100 reverse stock-split with a Certificate of Change, and changed our trading symbol to “BCRD.”
We filed a FINRA corporate action pursuant to FINRA Rule 6490 which was announced on the Daily List as of July 23, 2020.
Reseller
Agreement with EndlessOne Global, Inc.
Effective
August 15, 2020, we entered into the Authorized Reseller Agreement with the Program Manager (the “ Reseller Agreement ”)
for a two-year term, pursuant to which we have agreed to be a reseller or an independent sales representative of the Program Manager
and its products and the Program Manager has agreed to support our reselling efforts. The Reseller Agreement’s term was extended
on August 1, 2022 for a two-year period, and it expires on August 14, 2024. The Reseller Agreement does not provide exclusivity and there
are no volume sales requirements pertaining to our reselling efforts. The Reseller Agreement is renewable by mutual consent of each of
the parties for one-year terms unless either party provides written notice to the other party at least 90 days prior to the termination
of the term of the Reseller Agreement. The Reseller Agreement may be terminated by either party upon a material breach of either party
with the non-breaching party providing written notice to the breaching party and the breach remaining uncured with 60 days of the notice.
The Reseller Agreement may also be terminated by either party by written notice if either party ceases to carry on as a going concern,
becomes the object of the institution of voluntary or involuntary proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, makes an assignment
for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver is appointed with respect to all or a substantial part of its assets.

Critical
Accounting Policies
This
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section is based upon our financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“ U.S.
GAAP ”). The preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, but
not limited to, those related to income taxes, fair value derivatives, and accrued liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience,
performance metrics and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We apply the following critical accounting
policies in the preparation of our financial statements:
Use
of Estimates
Financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Among other things, management estimates include the estimated collectability of its accounts receivable, the valuation of long-lived
assets, warranty reserves, the assumptions used to calculate derivative liabilities, assumptions used to value equity instruments issued
for financing and compensation, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Results
of Operations for the Three Months and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Three Months and Nine Months Ended December
31, 2021 (Unaudited)
Revenues
and Cost of Sales
We
did not sell any prepaid cards to the customers during the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to selling
prepaid cards of $52,450 and $72,200 for the same comparable periods in 2021. Cost of sales were $0 for the three months and nine months
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $42,450 and $54,778 for the same comparable periods in 2021.
Operating
Expenses
Legal
& Filing Fees
Legal
and filing fees consisted of fees incurred by the Company in preparing and filing the regulatory reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Company recorded legal and filing fees of $2,859 and $24,634 for the three months and nine months ended December 31,
2022, compared to $1,622 and $10,080 for the same comparable periods in 2021, respectively. The increase in legal and filing fees for
the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022 resulted primarily due to the Company incurring fees for applying for listing
on the OTCQB platform and other expenses relating to the preparation of legal documents and filing fees in the ordinary course of business.
Rent
The
Company recorded rent expense of $26,430 and $73,168 for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $18,337and
$53,011 for the same comparable periods in 2021, respectively. The increase in rent expense for the three months and nine months ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to the comparable period in 2021, resulted due to the increase in monthly rent of the Company premises
in 2022 and monthly rent towards leasing a vehicle in July 2022.
General
& Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses (“G&A”) primarily included accounting, consulting and professional fees, officer’s
compensation and payroll taxes, depreciation, dues and subscriptions, and other administrative expenses. For the three months and nine
months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred G&A of $102,896 and $578,223 as compared to $124,077 and $348,327 for the same comparable
periods of 2021. The reduction in G&A for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the Company controlling and
better managing the professional advisors and consultants, research and development fees and marketing fees, payroll and other administrative
expenses to expand its infrastructure and operations. The increase in G&A expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 resulted
primarily due to retaining the services of professional business advisors to provide strategic consulting services to up list the Company
to OTCQX exchange and increase in payroll expense.
15
Other
Income (Expense)
Other
income and expenses include interest expense relating to the financing the purchase of Company vehicle and credit card interest. We reported
interest expense of $920 and $3,510 for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $829 and $1,987 for
the same comparable periods of 2021. The increase in interest expense resulted due to the credit card interest charged by the bank due
to Company making partial payments on its credit card balances.
Net
Loss
We
reported a net loss of $133,105 and $679,535 for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a net loss of
$134,865 and $395,983 for the same comparable periods in 2021. The increase in the net loss was primarily due to the increase in operating
expenses incurred by us.

of common stock of $372,500, and loan payments of $3,126 for purchase of vehicle. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine
months ended December 31, 2021 was $115,924 primarily due to cash proceeds from sale of stock of $124,000 and loan payments of $8,076
for purchase of vehicle.
Future
Capital Requirements
Our
current available cash may not be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Our capital requirements for the next twelve months
will depend on numerous factors, including management’s evaluation of the timing of projects to pursue. Subject to our ability
to generate revenues and cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital (including through possible joint ventures
and/or partnerships), we expect to incur substantial expenditures to carry out our business plan, as well as costs associated with our
capital raising efforts, and being a public company.
Our
plans to finance our operations include seeking equity and debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements, or other business
transactions, that would generate sufficient resources to ensure continuation of our operations.
The
sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through
the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could
contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms,
if at all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all
of our planned activities and limit our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
Inflation
The
amounts presented in our financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The
net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with
amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.
17
Going
Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we had incurred
a net loss of $679,535, used net cash in operating activities of $283,907 and accumulated deficit of $1,819,348. These matters raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of this filing. Our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable
operations in the future. Our management plans to provide for our capital requirements by continuing to issue additional equity and debt
securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, we will have
sufficient funds to execute our business plan or generate positive operating results. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our
management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements
which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are
required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We have identified the following accounting policies that we believe require application of management’s most subjective judgments,
often requiring the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
Our actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material.
While
our significant accounting policies are described in more details in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 2022 Annual
Report filed with the SEC on June 29, 2022, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Fair
value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
ASC
820, “Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures”,
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent,
objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value
hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Development
Stage and Capital Resources
We
have devoted substantially all of our efforts to business planning since our inception on July 6, 2007. Accordingly, we are considered
to be in the development stage. We have not generated revenues from our operations on a commercial scale and we will not commence generating
revenues until sometime during the fourth calendar quarter of 2022.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K. We did not have any
relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special-purpose entities that
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
We
have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our financial statements and do not believe
that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations which have not been adopted.
18
Impact
of COVID-19
During
the three months ended June 30, 2022, the effects of a new coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and related actions to attempt to control
its spread began to impact our business. The impact of COVID-19 on our operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was
limited, in all material respects, due to the government mandated numerous measures, including closures of businesses, limitations on
movements of individuals and goods, and the imposition of other restrictive measures, in its efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19
within the country.
On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Governments around the world have mandated, and
continue to introduce, orders to slow the transmission of the virus, including but not limited to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines,
significant restrictions on travel, as well as work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. Uncertainty with respect
to the economic effects of the pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets.
To
the extent that COVID-19 continues or worsens, governments may impose additional restrictions or additional governments may impose restrictions.
The result of COVID-19 and those restrictions could result in a number of adverse impacts to our business, including but not limited
to additional disruption to the economy and consumers’ willingness and ability to spend, temporary or permanent closures by businesses
that will consume our credit and debit cards, additional work restrictions, and supply chains being interrupted, slowed, or rendered
inoperable. As a result, it may be challenging to obtain and process credit and debit card transactions and supply chains to support
our business needs, and individuals could become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or
governmental restrictions. Also, governments may impose other laws, regulations or taxes which could adversely impact our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Further, if our customers’ businesses or incomes are similarly affected, they might delay or
reduce usage by our cardholders. The potential effects of COVID-19 also could impact us in a number of other ways including, but not
limited to, reductions to our profitability, laws and regulations affecting our business, the availability of future borrowings, the
cost of borrowings, and credit risks of our cardholders and counterparties. We have demonstrated adverse conditions that raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of our company as a going concern, in conjunction with COVID-19
impact, is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, our ability to obtain necessary financing to continue
our operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. Given the evolving health, economic, social, and governmental environments,
the potential impact that COVID-19 could have on our business remains uncertain. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could
be forced to cease operations.

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Currently, there is only one officer
and one director, and as such is solely responsible for evaluating the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon
that evaluation, the principal executive officer (who also serves as the principal financial and accounting officer) believes that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the following material weaknesses.
We lacked the ability to have adequate segregation of duties in the financial statement preparation process. Further the Company did
not maintain adequate documentation for review and supporting matters impacting financial reporting in gathering, analyzing and disclosing
information needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is recorded, summarized
and processed timely. The principal executive officer is directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other
than the remediation activities undertaken by us as disclosed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
