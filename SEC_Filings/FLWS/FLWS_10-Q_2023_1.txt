On May 31, 2019, the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2019 Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, and a group of lenders. The 2019 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s existing amended and restated credit agreement dated as of December 23, 2016 to, among other modifications: (i) increase the amount of the outstanding term loan (“Term Loan”) from approximately $97 million to $100 million, (ii) extend the maturity date of the outstanding Term Loan and the revolving credit facility (“Revolver”) by approximately 29 months to May 31, 2024, and (iii) decrease the applicable interest rate margins for LIBOR and base rate loans by 25 basis points. The Term Loan is payable in 19 quarterly installments of principal and interest beginning on September 29, 2019, with escalating principal payments, at the rate of 5.0% per annum for the first eight payments, and 10.0% per annum for the remaining 11 payments, with the remaining balance of $62.5 million due upon maturity. The Revolver, in the aggregate amount of $200 million, subject to seasonal reduction to an aggregate amount of $100 million for the period from January 1 through August 1, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, subject to certain restrictions. For each borrowing under the 2019 Credit Agreement, the Company may elect that such borrowing bear interest at an annual rate equal to either: (1) a base rate plus an applicable margin varying based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, where the base rate is the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the New York fed bank rate plus 0.5%, and (c) a LIBOR rate plus 1%, or (2) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin varying based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio.
The Company has established a NQDC Plan for certain members of senior management. Deferred compensation plan assets are invested in mutual funds held in a “rabbi trust,” which is restricted for payment to participants of the NQDC Plan. Trading securities held in a rabbi trust are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included in the “Other assets” line item, with the corresponding liability included in the “Other liabilities” line item in the consolidated balance sheets.
Corporate expenses consist of the Company’s enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, Executive and Customer Service Center functions, as well as Stock-Based Compensation. In order to leverage the Company’s infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment.

Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by
1 - 800 -FLOWERS.COM, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10 -Q and Article
10
of Regulation S- X.
Accordingly, they do
not
include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the
three
and
six -month periods ended
January 1, 2023
are
not
necessarily indicative of the results that
may
be expected for the fiscal year ending
July 2, 2023.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our
Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
July 3, 2022 , which provides a more complete understanding of our accounting policies, financial position, operating results and other matters.
The Company’s quarterly results
may
experience seasonal fluctuations. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company’s
second
fiscal quarter, is expected to generate over
40%
of the Company’s annual revenues, and all of its earnings. Due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Valentine’s Day, Easter, Administrative Professionals Week, and Mother's Day, revenues also have historically risen during the Company’s fiscal
third
and
fourth
quarters in comparison to its fiscal
first
quarter.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Net revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by discounts and estimates for credits and returns (calculated based upon previous experience and management’s evaluation). Service and outbound shipping charged to customers are recognized at the time the related merchandise revenues are recognized and are included in net revenues. Inbound and outbound shipping and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues. Net revenues exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.
A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:
●
E-commerce revenues - consumer products sold through our online and telephonic channels. Revenue is recognized when control of the merchandise is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Payment is typically due prior to the date of shipment.
●
Retail revenues - consumer products sold through our retail stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, at the point of sale, at which time payment is received.
●
Wholesale revenues - products sold to our wholesale customers for subsequent resale. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement. Payment terms are typically
30
days from the date control over the product is transferred to the customer.
●
BloomNet Services - membership fees as well as other service offerings to florists. Membership and other subscription-based fees are recognized monthly as earned. Services revenues related to orders sent through the floral network are variable, based on either the number of orders or the value of orders, and are recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered. The contracts within BloomNet Services are typically month-to-month and as a result
no
consideration allocation is necessary across multiple reporting periods. Payment is typically due less than
30
days from the date the services were performed.

Table of Contents
Deferred Revenues
Deferred revenues are recorded when the Company has received consideration (i.e. advance payment) before satisfying its performance obligations. As such, customer orders are recorded as deferred revenue prior to shipment or rendering of product or services. Deferred revenues primarily relate to e-commerce orders placed, but
not
shipped, prior to the end of the fiscal period, as well as for subscription programs, including our various food, wine, and plant-of-the-month clubs and our Celebrations Passport program.
Our total deferred revenue as of
July 3, 2022
was $ 33.7
million (included in “Accrued expenses” on our consolidated balance sheets), of which $ 9.9
and $ 26.8
million was recognized as revenue during the
three
and
six
months ended
January 1, 2023.
The deferred revenue balance as of
January 1, 2023
was $ 46.5
million.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company does
not
expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income during the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income during the period by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the potentially dilutive common shares (consisting of employee stock options and unvested restricted stock awards).
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:

Acquisitions
Acquisition of Vital Choice
On
October 27, 2021,
the Company completed its acquisition of all of the membership interests in Vital Choice Seafood LLC (“Vital Choice”), a provider of wild-caught seafood and sustainably farmed shellfish, pastured proteins, organic foods, and marine-sourced nutritional supplements. The Company utilized its existing credit facility to fund the $ 20.0
million purchase (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments), which included tradenames, customer lists, websites and operations. Vital Choice revenues were approximately $ 27.8
million during its most recent year ended
December 31, 2020.
After working capital and related adjustments, total consideration was approximately $ 20.0
million, and was preliminarily allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our preliminary estimates of their fair values, as a result of information that was available as of the date of the acquisition. During the quarter ended
January 1, 2023,
the Company finalized its purchase price allocation, resulting in immaterial adjustments to the preliminary carrying value of the respective recorded assets and the residual amount that was allocated to goodwill.

The estimated fair value of the acquired work in process and finished goods inventory was determined utilizing the income approach. The income approach estimates the fair value of the inventory based on the net retail value of the inventory, less operating expenses and a reasonable profit allowance. Raw materials inventory was valued at book value, as there have
not
been any significant price fluctuations or other events that would materially change the cost to replace the raw materials.
Of the acquired intangible assets, $ 4.3
million was assigned to customer lists, which is being amortized over the estimated remaining life of
5
years, $ 4.9
million was assigned to tradenames (indefinite life), and $ 5.0
million was assigned to goodwill (indefinite life), which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recognized is primarily related to synergistic value created in terms of both operating costs and revenue growth opportunities, enhanced financial and operational scale, and other strategic benefits.
The estimated fair value of the acquired tradenames was determined using the relief from royalty method, which is a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow approach. The relief from royalty method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. The relief from royalty method requires identifying the future revenue that would be generated by the trademark, multiplying it by a royalty rate deemed to be avoided through ownership of the asset and discounting the projected royalty savings amounts back to the acquisition date. The royalty rate used in the valuation was based on a consideration of market rates for similar categories of assets. The discount rate used in the valuation was based on the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, the riskiness of the earnings stream associated with the trademarks and the overall composition of the acquired assets.
The estimated fair value of the acquired customer lists was determined using the excess earnings method under the income approach. This method requires identifying the future revenue that would be generated by existing customers at the time of the acquisition, considering an appropriate attrition rate based on the historical experience of the Company. Appropriate expenses are then deducted from the revenues and economic rents are charged for the return on contributory assets. The after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted back to their net present value at an appropriate intangible asset rate of return and summed to calculate the value of the customer lists.
Operating results of the Vital Choice business are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition within the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment. Pro forma results of operations have
not
been presented, as the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial results was
not
material.

Acquisition of Alice ’ s Table
On
December 31, 2021,
the Company completed its acquisition of Alice’s Table, Inc. (“Alice’s Table”), a lifestyle business offering fully digital livestreaming and on demand floral, culinary and other experiences to guests across the country. The Company utilized existing cash of $ 0.8
million, contributed accounts receivable due from Alice’s Table of $ 0.3
million, and converted its cost method investment in Alice’s Table of $ 0.3
million, in order to acquire
100 % ownership in Alice’s Table, which included tradenames, customer lists, websites and operations. Immediately prior to completing the acquisition, the Company wrote down its previous cost method investment in Alice’s Table to its $ 0.3
million fair value, on the date of the acquisition, resulting in an impairment of $ 0.7
million, which is recorded in the “Other (income) expense, net” line item on the Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended
July 3, 2022.
Alice’s Table revenues were approximately $ 3.8
million during its most recent fiscal year ended
September 30, 2021.
The resulting total consideration of $ 1.3
million was preliminarily allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our preliminary estimates of their fair values, as a result of information that was available as of the date of the acquisition. During the quarter ended
January 1, 2023,
the Company finalized its purchase price allocation, resulting in immaterial adjustments to the preliminary carrying value of the respective recorded assets and the residual amount that was allocated to goodwill. The consideration transferred was allocated to: goodwill of $ 0.8
million, trademarks of $ 0.5
million, customer lists of $ 0.2
million ( 4 -year life), and liabilities of $ 0.2
million.

Investments
Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value
Investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, where the Company does
not
possess the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for at cost, less impairment (assessed qualitatively at each reporting period), adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These investments are included within “Other assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate carrying amount of the Company’s cost method investments was $ 3.5
million as of
January 1, 2023
and
July 3, 2022,
respectively.
Equity investments with a readily determinable fair value
The Company also holds certain trading securities associated with its Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (“NQDC Plan”). These investments are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included within the “Other assets” line item in the consolidated balance sheets (see

the Company, certain of its U.S. subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, entered into a Third Amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the
2019
Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment amends the
2019
Credit Agreement (the
2019
Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and the Third Amendment, the “Existing Credit Agreement”) to, among other modifications, (A) alter the financial maintenance covenants set forth therein by ( 1 ) increasing the required maximum consolidated leverage ratio, for the reference period ending
October 2, 2022,
from
3.25
to
1.00
to
4.25
to
1.00
and ( 2 ) decreasing the required minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, for the reference periods ending
October 2, 2022,
January 1, 2023,
and
April 2, 2023,
from
1.50
to
1.00
to
1.00
to
1.00
and (B) increase the amount of certain capital expenditures that
may
be disregarded for purposes of calculating the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio from $ 25.0
million to $ 35.0
million.
The Existing Credit Agreement requires that while any borrowings or commitments are outstanding the Company comply with certain financial covenants and affirmative covenants as well as certain negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments and make certain restricted payments. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of
January 1, 2023.
The Existing Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.
Future principal payments under the Term Loan and
2020  Term Loan are as follows: $ 10.0
million – remainder of fiscal
2023
and $ 145.0
million – fiscal
2024.

- Fair Value Measurements
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepaids, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Although
no
trading market exists, the Company believes that the carrying amount of its debt approximates fair value due to its variable nature. The Company’s investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies are carried at cost and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when an event or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value
may
have occurred. The Company’s remaining financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value (see table below). The Company’s non-financial assets, such as definite lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value
may
have occurred. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than
not
that an impairment
may
exist, as required under the accounting standards.

Table of Contents
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level
1
measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level
3
measurements). The
three
levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance are described below:
Level
1
Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
Level
2
Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are
not
active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level
3
Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or
no
market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The following table presents by level, within the fair value hierarchy, financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The Company has established a NQDC Plan for certain members of senior management. Deferred compensation plan assets are invested in mutual funds held in a “rabbi trust,” which is restricted for payment to participants of the NQDC Plan. Trading securities held in a rabbi trust are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included in the “Other assets” line item, with the corresponding liability included in the “Other liabilities” line item in the consolidated balance sheets.

Income Taxes
At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates its effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. This estimate is used in providing for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and
may
change in subsequent interim periods. The Company’s effective tax rate for the
three
and
six
months ended
January 1, 2023
was
25.5 % and
25.7 % respectively, compared to
24.0 % and
20.9 % in the same periods of the prior year. The effective rates for fiscal
2023
differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of
21.0 % due to state income taxes, nondeductible expenses for executive compensation and tax shortfalls related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by various permanent differences and tax credits. The effective tax rates for fiscal
2022
differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of
21.0 % due to state income taxes and nondeductible expenses for executive compensation, partially offset by various permanent differences and tax credits, including tax windfalls from stock-based compensation.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign countries. The Company completed its U.S. federal examination for fiscal
2018,
however, fiscal years
2019,
2020
and
2021
remain subject to U.S. federal examination. Due to ongoing state examinations and nonconformity with the U.S. federal statute of limitations for assessment, certain states remain open from fiscal
2016.
The Company's foreign income tax filings from fiscal
2017
are open for examination by its respective foreign tax authorities, mainly Canada, Brazil, and the United Kingdom.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. At
January 1, 2023,
the Company has an unrecognized tax benefit, including accrued interest and penalties, of approximately $ 1.4
million. The Company believes that $ 0.1
million of unrecognized tax positions will be resolved over the next
twelve
months.

Business Segments
The Company’s management reviews the results of its operations by the following
three
business segments:
•
Consumer Floral & Gifts,
•
BloomNet, and
•
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets
Segment performance is measured based on contribution margin, which includes only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments. As such, management’s measure of profitability for these segments does
not
include the effect of corporate overhead (see (a) below), nor does it include depreciation and amortization, other (income) expense, net and income taxes, or stock-based compensation, which are included within corporate overhead. Assets and liabilities are reviewed at the consolidated level by management and
not
accounted for by segment.

Leases
The Company currently leases plants, warehouses, offices, store facilities, and equipment under various leases through fiscal
2036.
Most lease agreements are of a long-term nature (over a year), although the Company does also enter into short-term leases, primarily for seasonal needs. Lease agreements
may
contain renewal options and rent escalation clauses and require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased properties. The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC
842.
At contract inception, we determine whether a contract is, or contains, a lease by determining whether it conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time, by assessing whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset.
16
Table of Contents
At the lease commencement date, we determine if a lease should be classified as an operating or a finance lease (we currently have
no
finance leases) and recognize a corresponding lease liability and a right-of-use asset on our Balance Sheet. The lease liability is initially and subsequently measured as the present value of the remaining fixed minimum rental payments (including base rent and fixed common area maintenance) using discount rates as of the commencement date. Variable payments (including most utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and variable common area maintenance) are expensed as incurred. Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to
not
apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of
12
months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets. The right-of-use asset is initially and subsequently measured at the carrying amount of the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments, remaining balance of lease incentives received, unamortized initial direct costs, or impairment charges relating to the right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment using the long-lived assets impairment guidance. The discount rate used to determine the present value of lease payments is our estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate, based on the yield curve for the respective lease terms, as we generally cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease.
We recognize expense for our operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As these leases expire, it can be expected that in the normal course of business they will be renewed or replaced. Renewal option periods are included in the measurement of lease liability, where the exercise is reasonably certain to occur. Key estimates and judgments in accounting for leases include how we determine: ( 1 ) lease payments, ( 2 ) lease term, and ( 3 ) the discount rate used in calculating the lease liability.

Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
Call Center Worker Claim:
In
March
of
2018,
a putative class action lawsuit was filed against a subsidiary of the Company (the “Subsidiary”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Medford Division (the “Court”), alleging violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and Oregon state law. The complaint was brought on behalf of a putative class of call center workers and alleged that certain Subsidiary policies and practices resulted in class members’ performance of unpaid work. The plaintiff sought class certification, compensation for alleged unpaid and underpaid wages, civil penalties, prejudgment interest, liquidated damages, litigation costs, and attorneys’ fees. Following mediation, the parties reached an agreement in
April 2022
to resolve all claims. In
September 2022,
the Court granted final approval of the settlement agreement, and in
November 2022,
the Company remitted payment of approximately $ 2.9
million, which was previously accrued during the quarter ended
March 27, 2022,
and was included in "Accrued expenses" in the consolidated balance sheets at
July 3, 2022.  In entering into the settlement agreement, the Subsidiary made
no
admission of liability.
In addition, there are various claims, lawsuits, and pending actions against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operations of its businesses. It is the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, that the final resolution of such claims, lawsuits and pending actions will
not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Macro-Economic Factors
Overall, consumer behavior continues to reflect the significant geo-political, inflationary forces and interest rate hikes that are affecting both their discretionary and nondiscretionary spending. Throughout the current fiscal year, we have seen that customer spending on “Everyday” gifting occasions has slowed, whereas spending for the major holidays has held up better, even while customers reverted to their historical shopping patterns, shopping much later in the holiday period. We also noticed that our customers shifted from our floral gifts towards our gourmet food products, consistent with trends we’ve seen in previous challenging macroeconomic environments. COVID still remains an impact on corporate gifting, which we attribute to macro-economic pressures and hybrid work environments.
For the balance of the fiscal year, we expect that customers will continue to moderate their spending on everyday gifting occasions, and while we also expect that our customers will continue to shop for the important people in their lives during the major upcoming holidays, including Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day, the second half of our fiscal year is more heavily weighted towards everyday gifting occasions.
The challenging macro-economic conditions that have affected our customers have also impacted our operating costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, in-bound and out-bound shipping, commodity, labor and fuel costs began to surge, and escalated throughout the balance of the year into our first quarter of fiscal 2023. During our second quarter of the current fiscal year, while certain commodity prices remain near historical highs, we began to see a more stable labor market, and year-over-year reductions in ocean freight costs. As a result of these trends, combined with our strategic pricing initiatives, and automation efforts, we expect to continue to see margin improvement during the second half of our fiscal year, as we cycle against the sharp inflationary period of a year ago.
Company Guidance
The Company is updating its fiscal 2023 guidance based on its second quarter performance and the current economic environment. While the highly unpredictable nature of the current macro economy makes it difficult to forecast in this environment, the Company continues to expect that after growing revenues 77% over the past three fiscal years, revenues will decline in fiscal 2023 on cautious consumer behavior. The Company also anticipates that as a result of the investments it has made, and continues to make, in its business platform, along with strategic pricing programs and a moderation of certain cost inputs, gross margins and bottom-line results will gradually improve during the latter half of the current fiscal year.
Full Year Fiscal 2023 Guidance
●
Total revenues to decline in the mid-single digit range on a percentage basis as compared with the prior year;
●
Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in a range of $80 million to $85 million; and
●
Free Cash Flow to exceed $75 million.
Refer to "Definitions of non-GAAP Financial Measures" for reconciliation of non-GAAP results to applicable GAAP results.

Table of Contents
Definitions of non-GAAP Financial Measures:
We sometimes use financial measures derived from consolidated financial information, but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Certain of these are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. See below for definitions and the reasons why we use these non-GAAP financial measures.  Where applicable, see the
Segment Information
and
Results of Operations
sections below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We do not provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income guidance or a reconciliation of free cash flow guidance to net cash provided by operating activities because doing so would require unreasonable efforts at this time, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of certain components of various necessary GAAP components, including for example those related to compensation, tax items, amortization or others that may arise during the year, and the Company's management believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The lack of such reconciling information should be considered when assessing the impact of such disclosures.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA
We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of stock-based compensation, NQDC Plan investment appreciation/depreciation, and for certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. See
Segment Information
for details on how EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were calculated for each period presented.
The Company presents EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because it considers such information meaningful supplemental measures of its performance and believes such information is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. The Company uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as factors to determine the total amount of incentive compensation available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees. The Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to determine its interest rate and to measure compliance with certain covenants. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (a) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; (b) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. EBITDA should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with GAAP results when evaluating the Company's performance.
Segment contribution margin   and adjusted segment contribution margin
We define segment contribution margin as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, before the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Adjusted segment contribution margin is defined as contribution margin adjusted for certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. See  Segment Information  for details on how segment contribution margin was calculated for each period presented.
When viewed together with our GAAP results, we believe segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin provide management and users of the financial statements meaningful information about the performance of our business segments.
Segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated with the use of segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin is that they are an incomplete measure of profitability as they do not include all operating expenses or non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for these limitations when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as operating income and net income.
Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share
We define adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share as net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share adjusted for certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. See  Segment Information  below for details on how adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share were calculated for each period presented.
We believe that adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share are meaningful measures because they increase the comparability of period-to-period results.
Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share, as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
Free Cash Flow
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. The Company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of fixed assets, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the Company’s business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet, and repurchase stock or retire debt. Free cash flow is a liquidity measure that is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies.
Since free cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.

(a) Segment performance is measured based on segment contribution margin or segment Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments, both of which are non-GAAP measurements. As such, management’s measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead, described above, depreciation and amortization, other income (net), and other items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance.
(b) Corporate expenses consist of the Company’s enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, Executive and Customer Service Center functions, as well as Stock-Based Compensation. In order to leverage the Company’s infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment.
(c) Income tax effect on adjustments is calculated based upon the Company’s effective tax rate during the applicable period.

Net revenues consist primarily of the selling price of the merchandise, service or outbound shipping charges, less discounts, returns and credits.
Net revenues decreased 4.8% and 4.1% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due to lower volume across all segments, as consumers reacted to the significant macro-economic pressures as core food and energy inflation continues to reduce consumer discretionary spending. The downward trend in “Everyday” e-commerce demand, which began in the latter half of fiscal 2022, persisted into the current quarter. However, as we had anticipated, consumers continued to spend for the major holidays and they reverted to their historical shopping patterns, shopping much later in the holiday period. We also noticed demand soften in corporate gifting, which we attribute to macro-economic pressures and hybrid work environments, whereas a year ago there were fewer in-person holiday get-togethers. Adjusted for the non-comparative impact of Alice’s Table and Vital Choice, which were acquired on December 31, 2021 and October 27, 2021, respectively, consolidated revenues decreased 5.0% and 4.7%, in comparison to the prior year periods.
To provide perspective, our post-pandemic fiscal 2023 (three and six months ended January 1, 2023) revenues exceeded our pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 (three and six months ended December 30, 2018) revenues by 57.2% and 62.2%, respectively. This revenue growth includes revenues attributable to Shari’s Berries, which was acquired in August 2019, PersonalizationMall, which was acquired on August 3, 2020, Vital Choice, which was acquired on October 27, 2021, and Alice's Table, which was acquired on December 31, 2021. Excluding revenues from these acquisitions, pro-forma, post-pandemic revenues for the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, exceeded pre-pandemic (three and six months ended December 30, 2018) revenues by 31.8% and 36.1%, respectively.

Revenue by sales channel:
E-commerce revenues
(combined online and telephonic) decreased 4.5% and 5.6% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, primarily as a result of a decline in demand for “Everyday” gifts within the Consumer Floral & Gifts segment, attributable to the macro-economic conditions noted above, which have negatively impacted consumer discretionary spending. E-commerce revenues within the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment were flat during the three months ended January 1, 2023, and down slightly during the six months ended January 1, 2023, in comparison to the same periods of the prior year, as our customers tend to gravitate towards food products during more challenging economic times. During the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, the Company fulfilled approximately 8.7 million and 11.8 million orders through its e-commerce sales channel (online and telephonic sales), a decrease of 10.3% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year. During the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, average order value increased 6.4% and 6.7%, to $90.66 and $87.11, respectively, as a result of strategic price increases, and product mix into higher price point items. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Vital Choice and Alice’s Table, pro-forma e-commerce revenues declined 4.8% and 6.4%, during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year.
Other revenues
are comprised of the Company’s BloomNet segment, as well as the wholesale and retail channels of its Consumer Floral & Gifts and Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segments. Other revenues decreased by 7.0% during the three months ended January 1, 2023, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable wholesale product and services revenues within the BloomNet segment, and timing of wholesale shipments within the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment as a result of several customers who requested product delivery in the first quarter of the fiscal year, in order to avoid supply chain congestion issues experienced in the prior year. Other revenues increased 6.6% during the six months ended January 1, 2023, compared to the same period of the prior year, due to increased wholesale product demand within the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment, as consumers returned to in person “brick-and-mortar” shopping, partially offset by the decline of wholesale product demand within the BloomNet segment.

Revenue by segment:
Consumer Floral & Gifts
– this segment, which includes the operations of the 1-800-Flowers.com and PersonalizationMall brands, as well as Alice’s Table, subsequent to its acquisition on December 31, 2021, derives revenue from the sale of consumer floral products and gifts through its e-commerce sales channels (telephonic and online sales), retail stores, and royalties from its franchise operations.
Net revenues within this segment decreased 12.1% and 11.5% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, due to reduced “Everyday” product demand, as consumer discretionary spending continues to shrink in the current inflationary environment. Pro-forma segment revenues decreased 12.3% and 11.7% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, adjusting for the acquisition of Alice’s Table.
BloomNet
- revenues in this segment are derived from membership fees, as well as product and service offerings. Net revenues decreased 13.4% and 3.7% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, due a decline in services revenues, which was attributable to membership/transaction fee revenues associated with a decline in order volume going through the network, as well as lower directory services ad revenues. Wholesale revenues were unfavorable during the three months ended January 1, 2023, due to the slowing macro-economic environment. Wholesale revenues were favorable during the six months ended January 1, 2023 due to strong wholesale product demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year, driven by product availability, which had been constrained by supply chain issues in the prior year.
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets
– this segment includes the operations of Harry & David, Wolferman’s, Stock Yards, Cheryl’s Cookies, The Popcorn Factory, 1-800-Baskets/DesignPac, Shari’s Berries, and Vital Choice, subsequent to its October 27, 2021 acquisition date. Revenue is derived from the sale of gourmet fruits, cookies, baked gifts, premium chocolates and confections, gourmet popcorn, gift baskets, dipped berries, prime steaks, chops, and fish, through the Company’s e-commerce sales channels (telephonic and online sales) and company-owned and operated retail stores under the Harry & David and Cheryl’s brand names, as well as wholesale operations.
Net revenues within this segment decreased 0.4% during the three months ended January 1, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable wholesale volume, due to the timing of DesignPac shipments which, at customer request, moved into the first quarter of the current year to avoid the supply chain delays experienced in the prior year. E-commerce revenues within the segment during the quarter were relatively flat in comparison to prior year as the direct-to-consumer food gifting business held up better during the holiday period, mitigating the softness in our corporate gifting business. Net revenues increased 1.2% during the six months ended January 1, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due to favorable wholesale volumes from improved demand as consumers return to traditional “brick-and-mortar” shopping. E-commerce revenues declined by 0.8% during the six months ended January 1, 2023 due to reductions in “EveryDay” volumes, due to macro-economic conditions, combined with the fact that the segment also experienced the highest growth rates during the Pandemic when food gifts/self-consumption peaked. Pro-forma segment revenues decreased 0.7%, and increased 0.2% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, adjusting for the acquisition of Vital Choice.

Gross profit consists of net revenues less cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of florist fulfillment costs (fees paid directly to florists), the cost of floral and non-floral merchandise sold from inventory or through third parties, and associated costs, including inbound and outbound shipping charges. Additionally, cost of revenues includes labor and facility costs related to direct-to-consumer and wholesale production operations, as well as payments made to sending florists related to order volume referred through the Company’s BloomNet network.
Gross profit decreased 2.8% and 6.9% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, primarily due to lower revenues noted above. Gross profit percentage increased 90 basis points during the three months ended January 1, 2023, compared to the prior year, driven by the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment, as a result of strategic pricing initiatives, lower in-bound freight costs, logistics optimization efforts, as well as an improvement in labor availability and automation. Gross profit percentage decreased by 110 basis points during the six months ended January 1, 2023 compared to the prior year, reflecting the annualization of macro-economic headwinds in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, attributable to higher commodity, labor, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including the impact of fuel surcharges, as well as the write-off of dated perishable product, partially offset by the previously noted improvements during the second quarter.
The Company has and will continue to implement strategies designed to mitigate the impact of these headwinds, including pricing initiatives across our product assortment, implementing logistics optimization programs to enhance our outbound shipping operations and manage rising third-party shipping costs and deploying automation to increase throughput and efficiency and address the high cost of labor. In addition, ocean freight costs have come down significantly from their highs of last year.
Gross profit by segment follows:
Consumer Floral & Gifts segment
- Gross profit decreased by 13.7% and 15.5% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, due to the lower revenues noted above, as well as a decrease in gross profit percentage. Gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by increased cost of merchandise, driven by higher ocean freight (carried on earlier inventory buys), as well as higher outbound freight, and labor rates, partially offset by pricing initiatives which are reflected in the higher average order value noted above.
BloomNet   segment -
Gross profit decreased by 13.4% and 9.7% during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, due to the lower revenues noted above, as well as the impact of a lower gross margin percentage during the six months ended January 1, 2023, due to the impact of sales mix, with a greater proportion of revenues derived from lower margin wholesale product sales, and higher rebates.
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment
- Gross profit increased by 4.0% during the three months ended January 1, 2023, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in gross profit percentage driven by strategic pricing initiatives, lower inbound transportation costs, and fulfillment automation. Gross profit during the six months ended January 1, 2023 was consistent with the same period of the prior year. The higher revenues noted above were partially offset by lower gross margins reflecting the annualization of macro-economic headwinds in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by the previously noted improvements during the second quarter.

Income Taxes
The Company recorded income tax expense of $28.3 million and $16.9 million, during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, respectively, and $28.0 million and $19.9 million, during the three and six months ended December 26, 2021, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended January 1, 2023 was 25.5% and 25.7%, respectively, compared to 24.0% and 20.9% in the same periods of the prior year. The effective rates for fiscal 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% due to state income taxes, nondeductible expenses for executive compensation and tax shortfalls related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by various permanent differences and tax credits. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2022 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% due to state income taxes and nondeductible expenses for executive compensation, partially offset by various permanent differences and tax credits, including tax windfalls from stock-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity and borrowings
The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and borrowings available under the Company’s Credit Agreement (see
Note 8 - Debt   in Item 1
for details). At January 1, 2023, the Company had working capital of $124.4 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $189.7 million, compared to working capital of $82.5 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $31.5 million, at July 3, 2022.
Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company’s second fiscal quarter, is expected to generate over 40% of the Company’s annual revenues, and all of its earnings. Due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Valentine’s Day, Easter, Administrative Professionals Week, and Mother’s Day, revenues also have historically risen during the Company’s fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter.
During the first two quarters of fiscal 2023, the Company borrowed under its revolving credit agreement in order to fund pre-holiday manufacturing and inventory procurement requirements, with borrowings peaking at $195.9 million in November 2022. Cash generated from operations during the Christmas holiday shopping season enabled the Company to repay the borrowings under the Revolver in December 2022. Based on current projected cash flows, the Company believes that available cash balances will be sufficient to provide for the Company’s operating needs through the remainder of fiscal 2023, at which time the Company would again expect to borrow against its Revolver to fund pre-holiday manufacturing and inventory purchases. The Company had no amounts outstanding under its Revolver as of January 1, 2023.
While we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We continually evaluate, and will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to require additional financing.
Cash Flows
Net cash provided by operating activities of $193.7 million, for the six months ended January 1, 2023, was primarily attributable to the Company’s net income during the period, adjusted by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense and stock-based compensation, combined with seasonal changes in working capital, including holiday related increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, inventory and trade receivables.
Net cash used in investing activities of $23.8 million, for the six months ended January 1, 2023, was attributable to capital expenditures primarily related to the Company's technology and automation initiatives.
Net cash used in financing activities of $11.6 million, for the six months ended January 1, 2023, related primarily to net repayments of bank borrowings under the Company’s working capital line of credit, and acquisition of treasury stock.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
As disclosed in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2022, the discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company’s most critical accounting policies relate to goodwill, other intangible assets and income taxes. There have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to the Company’s critical accounting policies since July 3, 2022.

Forward Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results
Our disclosure and analysis in this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent the Company’s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and can generally be identified by the use of statements that include words such as “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “foresee,” “likely,” “will,” “goal,” “target” or similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of the Company’s control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including:
●
the Company’s ability:
o
to achieve revenue and profitability;
o
to leverage its operating platform and reduce operating expenses;
o
to manage the seasonality of its business;
o
to cost effectively acquire and retain customers;
o
to successfully integrate acquired businesses and assets;
o
to reduce working capital requirements and capital expenditures;
o
to mitigate the impact of supply chain cost and capacity constraints;
o
to compete against existing and new competitors;
o
to manage expenses associated with sales and marketing and necessary general and administrative and technology investments; and
o
to cost effectively manage inventories;
●
the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings in the normal course of business; and
●
general consumer sentiment and economic conditions that may affect among other things, the levels of discretionary customer purchases of the Company’s products and the costs of shipping and labor.
We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Forms 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our
Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2022  listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers can find them in Part I, Item 1A, of that filing under the heading “Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995”. We incorporate that section of that Form 10-K in this filing and investors should refer to it. In addition, please refer to any additional risk factors in
Part II, Item 1A
in this Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to market risk from the effect of interest rate changes.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment of available cash balances and its long-term debt. The Company generally invests its cash and cash equivalents in investment grade corporate and U.S. government securities. Borrowings under the Company’s credit facility bear interest at a variable rate, plus an applicable margin, and therefore expose the Company to market risk for changes in interest rates. The effect of a 50 basis point increase in current interest rates on the Company’s interest expense would be approximately $0.4 and $0.7 million during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of January 1, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 1, 2023, due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to logical access and segregation of duties, at the application control level, in certain information technology environments. The material weakness was first identified and reported in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending July 3, 2022.
Management has taken steps to remediate these deficiencies, including redesigning the logical access and placing enhanced segregation of duties, enhancing its internal documentation and monitoring approach to ensure that all procedures designed to restrict access to applications and data are operating in an optimal manner in order to provide management with comfort that access is properly limited to the appropriate internal personnel. Management began to implement these remedial steps during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. In accordance with our internal control compliance program, a material weakness is not considered remediated until the remediation processes have been operational for a sufficient period of time and successfully tested. In light of this material weakness, management performed additional procedures over our IT environment and personnel affected to determine if any unauthorized action had been taken and found no such instances.
Notwithstanding the material weakness described in Management's Report on logical access and segregation of duties in certain technology environments, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by this form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except for the remedial actions described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the Company’s evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the quarter ended January 1, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Litigation
Call Center Worker Claim:
In March of 2018, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against a subsidiary of the Company (the “Subsidiary”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Medford Division (the “Court”), alleging violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and Oregon state law. The complaint was brought on behalf of a putative class of call center workers and alleged that certain Subsidiary policies and practices resulted in class members’ performance of unpaid work. The plaintiff sought class certification, compensation for alleged unpaid and underpaid wages, civil penalties, prejudgment interest, liquidated damages, litigation costs, and attorneys’ fees. Following mediation, the parties reached an agreement in April 2022 to resolve all claims. In September 2022, the Court granted final approval of the settlement agreement, and in November 2022, the Company remitted payment of approximately $2.9 million, which was previously accrued during the quarter ended March 27, 2022, and was included in "Accrued expenses" in the consolidated balance sheets at July 3, 2022. In entering into the settlement agreement, the Subsidiary made no admission of liability.
In addition, there are various claims, lawsuits, and pending actions against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operations of its businesses. It is the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, that the final resolution of such claims, lawsuits and pending actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS.
There were no material changes to the Company’s risk factors as discussed in Part 1, Item 1A-Risk Factors in the Company’s  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2022 .
