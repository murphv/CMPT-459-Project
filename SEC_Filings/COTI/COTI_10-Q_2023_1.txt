NINE ALLIANCE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY GROUP
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Nine Alliance Science and Technology Group (the “Company”)
was incorporated as Paramount Supply Inc. and established under the Corporation Laws of the State of Nevada on September 12, 2014. On
September 29, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment changing the name from “Paramount Supply Inc.” to “Nine
Alliance Science and Technology Group”. The Company was formed for the purpose of marketing and distributing ladies fashion handbags.
At the end of 2017 the Company became dormant and ceased all business operations.
On August 27, 2020, a motion and application was made
to appoint a Custodian of the Company based on prior management abandoning its responsibilities to continue making filings at the Nevada
Secretary of State’s office and for failing to hold a stockholders’ meeting in over 3 years and otherwise failing to keep
current in its obligations to the Company.  Upon motion and application to the District Court, Clark County Nevada, the Court granted
the request for Custodian for the Company (“Custodian”).   Upon granting the motion, the Court issued an Order
acknowledging that the Custodian has performed all of the duties that had been required of it and the management of the Company will
revert exclusively to the officers and directors appointed by the Custodian. In the Revival of the Company, Investment Reserves Series,
as the Custodian of the Company, appointed Joseph Passalaqua as CEO, CFO and Secretary. As of the period ended, December 31, 2022, Joseph
Passalaqua is CEO, CFO and Secretary.
NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 Basis of Presentation
The financial statements of the Company have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars.
The Company has adopted a September 30 fiscal year end.
2.2 Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Due to the limited level of operations, the Company
has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern.
2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.
As of the previous year ended September 30, 2022 the Company had $68 in total assets, cash on hand. At December 31, 2022, the Company
had $95 in total assets, cash on hand.
2.4 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
As defined in (Financial Accounting Standards Board
ASC 820), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company will utilize the market data of similar entities in its industry
or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent
in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The
Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).
The Company's financial instruments consist of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts payable and related party loans. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value
due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial
statements.
Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value
in our balance sheet, are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy established by GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure
fair value into the following levels:
Level 1 — Quoted market prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable and can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Inputs reflecting management's best
estimates and assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The inputs are
unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation of the instruments.

NINE ALLIANCE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY GROUP
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
A financial instrument's categorization within the
valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company follows ASC 820’s financial instruments
consist of accounts payable and amounts provided to the Company from related parties. The carrying amount of financial instruments approximates
fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
2.5 Stock-Based Compensation
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the
year ended September 30, 2022, the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees Stock-based compensation is accounted
for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted
any stock options.
2.6 Income Taxes
The Company follows the ASC 740-10 deferral method
of accounting for income taxes for assets and liabilities. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income
tax basis (temporary differences). The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. Future tax benefits which arise as result of accumulated losses have not be recognized
in these financial statements, as their realization is not likely to occur.
2.7 Basic Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes loss per share in accordance with
“ASC-260”, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the
face of the statement of operations.
Basic loss per share is computed by
dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted
loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all
potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
For the three months ended December
31, 2022 and the year ended September 30, 2022 there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding and
any such shares would have been excluded from the computation because they would have been anti-dilutive as the Company incurred losses
in this period.
2.8 Commitments and Contingencies
The Company follows ASC 440 & ASC 450, subtopic
450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies and commitments respectively. Certain conditions
may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved
when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and
such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending
against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal
proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates
that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability
would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency
is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an
estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
Loss contingencies considered remote are generally
not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon
information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect
the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.
2.9 Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company reviewed all the recently issued, but
not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.

ALLIANCE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY GROUP
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 (UNAUDITED)
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
The financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the
normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (March 25, 2008) resulting in an
accumulated deficit of $ 119,042
as of December 31, 2022 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Further,
the Company has current liabilities in excess of current assets and has a stockholders’ deficit at December 31, 2022. These factors
raise substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of
these financial statements.
Further, the effects of Covid-19
could also impact our ability to operate under the going concern and maintain sufficient liquidity to continue operations. The impact
of COVID-19 on companies is evolving rapidly and its future effects are uncertain. There are material uncertainties from Covid-19 that
cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to operate under the going concern. It is possible that our company will have issues
relating to the current situation that will need to be considered by management in the future. There will be a wide range of factors to
take into account in going concern judgments and financial projections including travel bans, restrictions, government assistance and
potential sources of replacement financing, financial health of suppliers and customers and their effect on expected profitability and
other key financial performance ratios including information that shows whether there will be sufficient liquidity to continue to meet obligations
when they are due.
Management believes that the
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the
necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management
intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. The
failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or obtaining additional funding would be detrimental to the Company.
NOTE 4 – COMMON STOCK
On February 25, 2021, the
Company filed a Certificate of Amendment through which the par value has been changed from $0.001 to $ 0.0001 . This change in par value
has been applied retroactively in the financial statements presented for the year ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019. The
Company changed the par value to increase the possibility of attracting a merger candidate.
Through this amendment (effective
February 25, 2021) Company also increased the authorized shares from
75,000,000
to
300,000,000 , of which
290,000,000
will be Common Stock
with a par value of $0.0001 and
10,000,000
will be Blank Check Preferred Stock with a par value of $ 0.0001 . Before this amendment, Company
did not have any authorized Preferred Stock.
On December 7, 2021, the Company
issued
150,000,000
shares of Common Stock to Friction & Heat LLC; Joseph Passalaqua as Managing Member, in exchange for debt in the
amount of $ 28,694 , paid for Company expenses in 2020 and 2021.
As of the year ended September
30, 2022, the Company had
290,000,000
shares of Common Stock Authorized and
225,000,000
shares of Common Stock Issued and Outstanding
and
10,000,000
shares of Blank Check Preferred Stock Authorized and 0 Issued and Outstanding.
As of the three months ended
December 31, 2022, the Company had

225,000,000
shares of Common Stock Issued and Outstanding
and
10,000,000

OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONS
Our Business and Recent Developments
Nine Alliance Science & Technology Group (“Nine Alliance”,
“We”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 12, 2014, under the name Paramount
Supply Inc. The Company then known as Paramount Supply Inc. last filed a financial report with the SEC on August 25, 2017. On September
29, 2017, our name was changed to Nine Alliance Science & Technology Group. On August 27, 2020, a motion and application was made
to appoint a Custodian of the Company based on prior management abandoning its responsibilities to continue making filings at the Nevada
Secretary of State’s office and for failing to hold a shareholders’ meeting in over 3 years and otherwise failing to keep
current in its obligations to the Company.  Upon motion and application to the District Court, Clark County Nevada, the Court granted
the request for Custodian for the Company (“Custodian”).   Upon granting the motion, the Court issued an Order acknowledging
that the Custodian has performed all of the duties that had been required of it and the management of the Company will revert exclusively
to the officers and directors appointed by the Custodian. In the Revival of the Company, Investment Reserves Series, as the Custodian
of the Company, appointed Joseph Passalaqua as CEO, CFO and Secretary.
The Company is a “blank check company,” as that term is defined
in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have not had preliminary contact or discussions with,
nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements, or understandings with, any representatives of the owners of any business or
company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger. We are a “shell company” within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated
pursuant to Securities Act, because we do have no hard assets and real business operations.
From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating
activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company and the initial equity funding by our sole officer and director.
We received our initial funding of $4,000 from a previous sole officer and director at that time who purchased 4,000,000 shares of common
stock at $0.001 per share.  Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
Previous business operations of the Company generated limited revenues and
the Company currently has no business operations.
No revenue has been generated in the last two years ended September 30,
2021 and September 30, 2022.
On June 2, 2021, we voluntarily filed a termination of our registration
statement on Form 15-15D pursuant to Rule 15d-6 and our termination becomes effective 90 days thereafter.  The Company has since
been seeking a merger target and has been evaluating various opportunities.
We never sold any securities under the offering statement, so there was
no need to keep the prospectus and Form S-1 filing current.
13
The Company filed a Registration Statement; Form-10-12g on June
16, 2021 and was effective 60 days post filing.
We are subject to the requirements of Regulation 13A under the Exchange
Act, which require us to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and we are
required to comply with all other obligations of the Exchange Act applicable to issuers filing registration statements pursuant to Section
12(g) of the Exchange Act.
We are not currently engaged in any business operations. We are, however,
in the process of attempting to identify, locate, and if warranted, acquire new commercial opportunities. The Company is currently attempting
to locate and negotiate with eligible portfolio companies to acquire an interest in them. In addition to acquiring an interest in them,
the Company intends to assist these portfolio companies with raising capital and offer them substantial managerial assistance needed to
succeed.
The authorized capital stock of Nine Alliance Science & Technology Group
consists of 290,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”) and 10,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Preferred”).
As of our previous year ended September 30, 2022, there were 225,000,000
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.
As of the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were 225,000,000 shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.
Our Business
The Company is currently attempting to locate and negotiate with eligible
portfolio companies to acquire an interest in them. In addition to acquiring an interest in them, the Company intends to assist these
portfolio companies with raising capital and offer them substantial managerial assistance needed to succeed.
We are currently considered a shell company Rule 405 defines a shell company
as a company with 1) no or nominal operations, and either 2)no or nominal assets, 3) assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents,
or 4) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. We will remain classified as a shell company
until we qualify for an exemption pursuant to Rule 144 (i)(2) by meeting the following requirements: Nine Alliance Science & Technology
Group is no longer a shell company and has not been one for a year, it mandatorily files reports with the SEC, it has filed all required
reports during the past 12 months, and it has been over a year since the current Form 10 information was filed. Security holders will
not be able to rely on Rule 144 for the resale of restricted and/or control securities as long as JMKJ remains classified as a shell corporation.
Our current business address is: 7325 Oswego Road, Liverpool, NY 13090 .
Our telephone number is (315) 451-7515.
This location serves as our primary office for planning and implementing
our business plan. Management believes the current premises arrangements are sufficient for its needs for at least the next 12 months.
Employees
We have no employees.

2022 was $(4,859), an increase of $414 for the comparable period of December 31, 2021, of which the loss from operations was $(4,445).

Critical Accounting Policies
Going Concern
We have not attained profitable operations and are
dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment
of profitable operations from our future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern .
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on
our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management’s plan includes
obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances; however, there is no
assurance of additional funding being available.
The Company, as of the date of this filing had
approximately $95 in cash and has not earned any revenues from operations to date. For the last three months ending December 31, 2022,
our operating expenses were $4,859. In the previous two fiscal years our operating expenses were $33,890 and $17,308 in the years ended
September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 respectively, consisting primarily of professional fees, administrative expenses and filing
fees. The ongoing expenses of the Company will be related to seeking out a suitable acquisition as well as mandatory filing requirements
including our reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of the registration statement filed.
16
The Company continues to rely on borrowings and financings
either arranged by the Company’s President or through entities controlled by the President. In the next 12 months we expect to incur
expenses equal to approximately $20,000 related to legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation
to the Company’s Exchange Act filing requirements. The costs related to the acquisition of a business combination target company
vary widely and are dependent on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the amount of time it takes to complete a business
combination, the location of the target company, the size and complexity of the business of the target company, whether stockholders of
the Company prior to the transaction will retain equity in the Company, the scope of the due diligence investigation required, the involvement
of the Company’s auditors in the transaction, possible changes in the Company’s capital structure in connection with the transaction,
and whether funds may be raised contemporaneously with the transaction. Therefore, we believe such costs are unascertainable until the
Company identifies a business combination target. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is currently devoting its efforts to locating merger candidates. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately,
achieve profitable operations.
The Company may consider a business which has recently commenced operations,
is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or
service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital.
Our management believes that the public company status that results from a combination with the Company will provide such company greater
access to the capital markets, increase its visibility in the investment community, and offer the opportunity to utilize its stock to
make acquisitions. There is no assurance that we will in fact have access to additional capital or financing as a public company. In the
alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional
capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant
expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.
Our sole officer and director has not had any preliminary contact or discussions
with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially
unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or
earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early
stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized
by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there
can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
Our management anticipates that it will likely be able
to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective
stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business
in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us,
because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
The Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. While the Company is in a competitive market with a small number of business opportunities, through information obtained from industry professionals including attorneys, investment bankers, and other consultants with experience in the reverse merger industry, our management believes that there are opportunities for a business combination with firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
We do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder”
to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses.
17
We have not established a specific timeline nor have we created a
specific plan to identify an acquisition target and consummate a business combination. We expect that our management and the Company,
through its various contacts and affiliations with other entities will locate a business combination target. We expect that funds in the
amount of approximately $20,000 will be required in order for the Company to satisfy its Exchange Act reporting requirements during the
next 12 months, in addition to any other funds that will be required in order to complete a business combination. Such funds can only
be estimated upon identifying a business combination target. Our management and stockholders have indicated an intent to advance funds
on behalf of the Company as needed in order to accomplish its business plan and comply with its Exchange Act reporting requirements, however,
there are no agreements in effect between the Company and our management or stockholders specifically requiring they provide any funds
to the Company. Therefore, there are no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain the required financing as needed in order to
consummate a business combination transaction.
The effects of Covid -19 could impact our ability to operate under the going
concern and maintain sufficient liquidity to continue operations. The impact of COVID-19 on companies is evolving rapidly and its future
effects are uncertain. There are material uncertainties from Covid-19 that cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to operate
under the going concern. It is possible that our company will have issues relating to the current situation that will need to be considered
by management in the future. There will be a wide range of factors to take into account in going concern judgments and financial projections
including travel bans, restrictions, government assistance and potential sources of replacement financing, financial health of suppliers
and customers and their effect on expected profitability and other key financial performance ratios including information that shows whether
there will be sufficient liquidity to continue to meet obligations when they are due.
The Company filed a Form 10K for the year ended September 30, 2022 and a
Form 10Q ended December 31, 2022 and will continue to file all required annual and quarterly reports on schedule. Management believes
that this plan provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next
twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. The failure to achieve the
necessary levels of profitability or obtaining additional funding would be detrimental to the Company.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.
Default on Notes
There are currently no notes in default.
Other Contractual Obligations
As of the year ended September 30, 2022
and the three months ended December 31, 2022, we did not have any contractual obligations.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
As a smaller reporting company (as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item 3.
18
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including Joseph Passalaqua, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company’s limited
resources and lack of employees, management, including Joseph Passalaqua, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2022 and as of the date of this filing, January
30, 2023.
Management has identified control deficiencies regarding inadequate accounting
resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment. Management of the Company believes
that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company’s accounting staff.  The small size of the Company’s
accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation.
To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely
heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting professionals. As we grow,
we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control
framework.
These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances
that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our financial
statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with
US GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our financial statements for the quarter ended December
31, 2022 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all
fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
No changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting have
come to management's attention during the Company's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect,
the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
