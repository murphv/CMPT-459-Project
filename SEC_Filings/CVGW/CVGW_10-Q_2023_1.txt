Table of Contents CALAVO GROWERS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) ​ 1. Description of the business ​ Business ​ Calavo Growers, Inc. (referred to in this report as “Calavo”, the “Company”, “we’, “us” or “our”), is a global leader in the avocado industry and a provider of value-added fresh food.
Our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados, prepared avocados, and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to retail grocery, foodservice, club stores, mass merchandisers, food distributors and wholesalers on a worldwide basis. We procure avocados from California, Mexico and other growing regions around the world.
Through our various operating facilities, we (i) sort, pack, and/or ripen avocados, tomatoes and/or Hawaiian grown papayas, (ii) create, process and package a portfolio of healthy fresh foods including fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, and prepared foods and (iii) process and package guacamole and salsa. We distribute our products both domestically and internationally and we report our operations in
two
different business segments:
Grown and Prepared. ​ The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation  S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year.
These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2022. ​ 2.
Information regarding our operations in different segments
​ We report our operations in  two
different business segments: Grown, and Prepared. The Grown segment consists of fresh avocados, tomatoes and papayas. The Prepared segment comprises all other products including fresh cut fruits and vegetables, ready-to-eat sandwiches, wraps, salads and snacks, guacamole, and salsa sold at retail and food service as well as avocado pulp sold to foodservice. These
two   business segments are presented based on how information is used by our Chief Executive Officer to measure performance and allocate resources. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as other non-operating income/expense items, are evaluated by our Chief Executive Officer in the aggregate.
We do not allocate assets, or specifically identify them, to our operating segments. Prior year information has been recast to conform with the new segment disclosures which was effective as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. The sales data in the following tables is presented in thousands: 8

million between Grown products and Prepared products were eliminated.
​ Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately $ 7.6
million, and $ 7.1
million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.
​ Our foreign operations in Mexico are subject to exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency transaction costs. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries in Mexico is the United States dollar (U.S. dollar). As a result, monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date and non-monetary assets, liabilities and equity are translated at historical rates. Sales and expenses are translated using a weighted-average exchange rate for the period. Gains and losses resulting from those remeasurements and foreign currency transactions are recognized within cost of sales. We recognized foreign currency remeasurement gains in the current quarter.

​ 4. Related party transactions ​ Board of Directors ​ Certain members of our Board of Directors market California avocados through Calavo pursuant to marketing agreements substantially similar to the marketing agreements that we enter into with other growers. There were
no
avocados procured from entities owned or controlled by members of our Board of Directors for the three months ended January 31, 2023. For the three months ended January 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of avocados procured from entities owned or controlled by members of our Board of Directors was $ 0.2
million. We did
no t have any amounts payable to these Board members as of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022. ​ Agricola Don Memo, S.A. de C.V. (“Don Memo”) ​ Calavo and Agricola Belher (“Belher”) have an equal
one -half ownership interest in Don Memo.
Pursuant to a management service agreement, Belher, through its officers and employees, has day-to-day power and authority to manage the operations.
​ As of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, we had an investment of $ 3.9
million and $ 3.8
million, representing Calavo’s
50 % ownership in Don Memo, which was included as an investment in unconsolidated entities on our balance sheet.  We make advances to Don Memo for operating purposes, provide additional advances as shipments are made during the season, and return the proceeds from tomato sales under our marketing program to Don Memo, net of our commission and aforementioned advances. For the three months ended January 31, 2023, we advanced an additional $ 0.9
million of preseason advances to Don Memo.
As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, we had outstanding advances of
$ 7.9
million and $ 7.0
million to Don Memo. In October 2020, we entered into an infrastructure loan agreement with Don Memo for up to $ 2.4
million secured by certain property and equipment of Don Memo.
This infrastructure loan accrues interest at
7.25 % .
The total outstanding infrastructure loan balance at January 31, 2023 and at October 31, 2022, was
$ 1.6
million ($ 0.4
million is included in prepaids and other current assets and $ 1.2
million in other assets).
This infrastructure loan agreement will mature in fiscal 2024. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred
$ 5.0
million and $ 3.4
million of cost of sales to Don Memo pursuant to our purchase consignment agreement.
​ Belher ​ We make advances to Belher for operating purposes, provide additional advances as shipments are made during the season, and return the proceeds from tomato sales under our marketing program to Belher, net of our commission and aforementioned advances. We had grower advances due from Belher totaling $ 4.7
million and $ 4.5
million as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, which are netted against the grower payable.
In addition, we had infrastructure advances due from Belher of
$ 0.9
million as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.
These infrastructure advances were
10
Table of Contents recorded as a receivable in prepaid and other current assets as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. In July 2021, we made a bridge loan of
$ 3.5
million to Belher.
This loan is secured by certain farmland in Mexico and accrues interest at
10 %. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, this loan was amended to be due with installments of $ 0.9
million on July 31, 2022, $ 0.9
million on July 31, 2023 and $ 1.7
million on July 31, 2024. As part of this amended loan agreement, we can withhold payments on both the infrastructure advances and the bridge loan through the netting against the grower payable due to Belher.
The total outstanding bridge loan balance at January 31, 2023 and at October 31, 2022, was
$ 2.6
million ($ 0.9
million is included in prepaids and other current assets and $ 1.7

per share dividend in the aggregate amount of $ 5.1
million to shareholders of record on November 16, 2022. Litigation ​ From time to time, we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Mexico tax audits ​ We conduct business both domestically and internationally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in U.S. federal, U.S. state and certain foreign jurisdictions.  Accordingly, in the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities, primarily in Mexico and the United States.  ​ 13
Table of Contents 2013 Assessment ​ In January 2017, we received preliminary observations from the Servicio de Administracion Tributaria in Mexico (the “SAT”) related to an audit for fiscal year 2013 outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and IVA. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017. During the period from our third fiscal quarter of 2017 through our third fiscal quarter of 2018, we attempted to resolve our case with the SAT through the conclusive agreement submitted before PRODECON (Mexican Tax Ombudsman), having several working meetings attended by representatives of the SAT, Calavo de Mexico (CDM) and the PRODECON. However, we were unable to materially resolve our case with the SAT through the PRODECON process. ​ As a result, in July 2018, the SAT’s local office in Uruapan issued to CDM a final tax assessment (the “2013 Assessment”) totaling approximately $ 2.6
billion Mexican pesos (which includes annual adjustments for inflation, and equals approximately $ 138.4
million USD at January 31, 2023) related to Income Tax, Flat Rate Business Tax, and value added tax, related to this fiscal 2013 tax audit.  This amount has been adjusted for inflation as of January 31, 2023 to the amount of $ 3.08
billion Mexican pesos (approx. $ 163.9
million USD).  Additionally, the tax authorities have determined that we owe our employees profit-sharing liability, totaling approximately $ 118
million Mexican pesos (approx. $ 6.2
million USD at January 31, 2023).
In August 2018, we filed an Administrative Appeal on the 2013 Assessment, appealing our case to the SAT’s central legal department in Michoacan.  ​ On June 25, 2021, we became aware that the Administrative Appeal had been resolved by the SAT against CDM on March 12, 2021, and that we had allegedly failed to timely respond to and challenge the SAT’s notification of such resolution, therefore rendering the 2013 Assessment as definitive. Consequently, the SAT placed liens on the fixed assets of CDM, with a net book value of approximately $ 26
million USD, and on bank accounts of CDM totaling approximately $ 1
million USD in order to guaranty the 2013 Assessment. Based on legal counsel from our tax advisory firm, we and our tax advisory firm have concluded that the March notification was not legally communicated. ​ On August 18, 2021, we filed an Administrative Reconsideration (the Reconsideration) before the Central Legal Department of the SAT located in Mexico City, asserting that the resolution in March of the Administrative Appeal was wrongly concluded, in particular with respect to the following matters: o Failure to recognize CDM as a “maquiladora” o Considering the Company to have a permanent establishment in Mexico,
o Including fruit purchase deposits transferred by the Company to CDM as taxable,
o Application of
16 %
IVA tax to fruit purchase deposits; and o Imposing double-taxation on the fruit purchase transactions ​ On August 20, 2021 we filed an Annulment Suit (the Annulment Suit) with the Federal Tax Court, which among other things, strongly contends that the notifications made by the SAT to CDM and its designated advisors of the resolution of the Administrative Appeal in March 2021 were not legally communicated. In addition, the Annulment Suit asserts the same matters central to the Reconsideration, as described above, as wrongly concluded in the resolution of the Administrative Appeal. ​ On August 27, 2021, we filed a formal complaint, or
queja , (the “Complaint”) before the PRODECON to request its assistance with having the SAT act upon the Reconsideration. The Complaint was withdrawn in September, but may still be reinstated if deemed appropriate in the future.
​ On September 22, 2021, we had an initial in-person meeting with the SAT in Mexico City to formally present and discuss the Reconsideration. The SAT agreed to review our Reconsideration in more detail; however, on January 3, 2022, the SAT formally rejected our request for the Reconsideration. In response to this rejection, on January 21, 2022, we filed an injunction suit with a federal district court seeking to nullify the arguments against the Reconsideration made by the SAT on constitutional grounds. ​ 14
Table of Contents On February 4, 2022, we had a follow-up meeting with the SAT in Mexico City to begin a dialog with the objective of reaching a settlement of the 2013 Assessment. The SAT agreed in principle to continue this dialog, but requested that we provide a financial guaranty to secure the related tax as a pre-requisite to these discussions. ​
On February 25, 2022, we filed an additional injunction in which we seek to have the liens against the bank accounts of CDM lifted. The injunction suit has been accepted by the court and we are expecting a response in the next 2 - 3 months. The main purpose of the injunction suit was to challenge the SAT’s response issued to the Reconsideration, and with that, to keep the Reconsideration alive until the injunction suit is decided. This would allow time to continue the discussions with SAT at the administrative level and would give SAT the legal basis to issue a new resolution. This injunction suit represents a further opportunity for a Court of Law to analyze this matter from a constitutional perspective. ​ The injunction suit has been admitted for analysis by the District Court, however, SAT filed a complaint (queja) against the ruling allowing CDM to file an extension of the injunction suit aiming to appoint as a defendant other than SAT’s authority that were involved in the reconsideration appeal's resolution. This complaint was filed by SAT to challenge the admission and analysis of the injunction suit; this complaint is expected to be decided by the Circuit Courts within the next couple of months. ​ On March 4, 2022, the Annulment Suit was formally accepted by the Federal Tax Court, which simultaneously granted a provisional suspension of the collections proceedings by the SAT. The acceptance by the court of the Annulment Suit renders the 2013 Assessment as non-definitive, until such time as the suit is resolved.
On March 10, 2022, we met with the SAT and offered an Administrative Guaranty ( Embargo en Via Administrativa)
to secure the 2013 Assessment ,
which provides the SAT with certain administrative rights to CDM assets in the unlikely event we do not prevail in our actions through the Federal Tax Court (see below). Once the Administrative Guaranty is in place, the existing liens over the assets of CDM will be removed and the SAT collection process will be suspended.
​ On April 27, 2022, the SAT provided a Positive Compliance Opinion to CDM, and consequently on April 29, 2022, the Tax Authority renewed the VAT Certification to CDM. These two resolutions signal a positive development on the Tax controversies in Mexico.
On April 29, 2022, we submitted all the documentation required to the Tax Authority and the Federal Tax Court to continue with the consideration of the Administrative Guaranty.
​ On June 16, 2022 we received a request from the Tax Authorities to provide information related to the Administrative Guaranty. The information was presented on July 7, 2022, and on August 2, 2022. On August 8, 2022, we met with Tax Authorities in Mexico City to review the information presented and agreed to next steps on the approval of the Guarantee. Since then, the Tax Authorities have visited Calavo Mexico to continue the validation process and we believe will have a resolution in the next 2 - 3 months.
​ On October 10, 2022, the Tax Court ruled in favor of CDM granting the definitive suspension, accepting the Administrative Guaranty and forcing the SAT to remove all liens placed on CDM fixed assets and bank accounts.
These liens were removed in November 2022. The Court also recognized that the
$ 3.1
billion peso assessment exceeds the economic capacity of CDM. ​ While we continue to believe that the 2013 Assessment is completely without merit, and that we will prevail on the Annulment Suit in the Tax Court, we also believe that it is in the best interest of CDM and the Company to settle the 2013 Assessment as quickly as possible. Furthermore, we believe that the above actions taken by CDM will encourage the SAT to agree to reach a settlement. In accordance with our cumulative probability analysis on uncertain tax positions, our recent settlements made by the SAT in other cases, the 2011 Assessment settlement reached by CDM with the MFM, and the value of CDM assets, we recorded a provision of $ 11
million USD, in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as a discrete item in Income Tax Provision. The provision includes estimated penalties, interest and inflationary adjustments.
We believe that this provision remains appropriate as of January 31, 2023 based on our cumulative probability analysis.
We incurred
$ 0.6
million of related professional fees for the three months ended January 31, 2023, which have been recorded in Expenses related to Mexican Tax matters. ​ 15

​ 10. Mexican IVA taxes receivable ​ Included in other assets are tax receivables due from the Mexican government for value-added taxes (“IVA”) paid in advance. CDM is charged IVA by vendors on certain expenditures in Mexico, which, insofar as they relate to the exportation of goods, translate into IVA amounts recoverable from the Mexican government. ​ As of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, CDM IVA receivables totaled $ 46.4
million ( 892.0
million Mexican pesos) and $ 43.6
million ( 865.4
million Mexican pesos).
Historically, CDM received IVA refund payments from the Mexican tax authorities on a timely basis. Beginning in fiscal 2014 and continuing into fiscal 2023, the tax authorities began objecting to refund requests and supporting documentation that had previously been deemed acceptable to process a refund. Additionally, they are also contesting the refunds requested attributable to IVA paid to certain suppliers that allegedly did not fulfill their own tax obligations. We believe these factors and others have contributed to delays in the processing of IVA claims by the Mexican tax authorities.
Currently, we are in the process of collecting such balances primarily through regular administrative processes, but these amounts may ultimately need to be recovered through Administrative Appeals and/or other legal means.
​ During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the tax authorities informed us that their internal opinion, based on the information provided by the local SAT office, considers that CDM is not properly documented relative to its declared tax structure and therefore CDM cannot claim the refundable IVA balance. CDM has strong arguments and supporting documentation to sustain its declared tax structure for IVA and income tax purposes. CDM started an Administrative Appeal for the IVA related to the request of the months of July, August and September of 2015 (the “2015 Appeal”) in order to assert its argument that CDM is properly documented and to therefore change the SAT’s internal assessment. In
16
Table of Contents August 2018, we received a favorable ruling from the SAT’s Legal Administration in Michoacan on the 2015 Appeal indicating that they believe CDM’s legal interpretation of its declared tax structure is indeed accurate.
While favorable on this central matter of CDM’s declared tax structure, the ruling, however, still does not recognize the taxpayers right to a full refund for the IVA related to the months of July, August and September 2015. Therefore, in October 2018, CDM filed a substance-over-form Annulment Suit in the Federal Tax Court to recover its full refund for IVA over the subject period, which is currently pending resolution. ​ In April 2022, the Tax Court issued the ruling for the months of July, August and September 2015 through which it was declared that the following resolutions were resolved: ​ ● It is recognized that CDM operates as a maquila under the authorization of the Ministry of Finance. ​ ● It is recognized that all bank deposits corresponding to the purchase of avocados on behalf of Calavo Growers Inc. (CGI), are subject to the maquila program and it is not accruable income for purposes of Income Tax nor activities subject to VAT.
​ ● It is recognized that VAT is recoverable, since CDM demonstrated the existence of operations carried under the maquila services. ​ ● Resolved that certain VAT amounts attributed to the purchase of certain packing materials are not recoverable as CDM was not the buyer on record and therefore did not pay for the materials, which approximated
$ 6.9
million pesos (approximately
$ 0.4
million USD).
​
In January 2023 the Federal Tax Court issued a definitive resolution confirming the ruling from April 2022, ordering SAT to refund approximately
$ 18
million pesos (approx. $ 1.0
million USD at January 31, 2023) and confirming that the $ 6.9
million pesos (approx. $ 0.4
million USD at January 31, 2023) related to packing materials will not be recoverable.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, we recognized a reserve of
$ 1.4
million USD for Mexican IVA tax receivables related to certain packing material vendors corresponding to the years 2013 and 2015.
This reserve includes the amounts included in the January 2023 ruling as well as other similar receivables that are subject to proceedings in this same Federal Tax Court. ​ We believe that our operations in Mexico are properly documented, and our internationally recognized tax advisors believe that there are legal grounds to prevail in collecting the corresponding IVA amounts. With assistance from our internationally recognized tax advisory firm, as of January 31, 2023, CDM has filed Administrative Appeals for months for which IVA refunds have been denied by the SAT, and will continue filing such appeals for any months for which refunds are denied in the future. Therefore, it is probable that the Mexican tax authorities will ultimately authorize the refund of the remaining IVA amounts.
​ 11. Credit Facility ​ We have a revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America) as administrative agent and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. as joint lead arranger and sole bookrunner, and Farm Credit West (FCW), as joint lead arranger. ​ On November 1, 2022, we entered into a Seventh Amendment to our Credit Facility, which permitted us to declare cash dividends so long as (i) after giving effect to any such dividend a new Consolidated Dividend Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is not less than
1.20
to 1.00 and (ii) any such cash dividends are paid in the same fiscal quarter in which they are declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing restriction, we may declare and make a dividend payment in an amount not to exceed $ 5,200,000
on or before January 31, 2023.   ​ As of January 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants, and we expect to remain in compliance. As of January 31, 2023, approximately $ 26.0
million was available for borrowing, based on our borrowing base calculation discussed above.
We have a letter of credit balance of
$ 3.2
million as of January 31, 2023, that lowers the amount available per our Credit Facility.

Table of Contents ​
The weighted-average interest rate under the Credit Facility was
6.2 % and
4.9 % at January 31, 2023, and October 31 2022, respectively.  Under the Credit Facility, we had $ 16.4
million and $ 1.2
million outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, and had standby letters-of-credit of $ 3.2
million as of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022.
​ 12. Subsequent Events ​
Calavo Salsa Lisa ​ On March 6, 2023, we announced our plans to divest our salsa business in our Prepared segment. This divestiture and the below described restructuring are part of a broader set of organizational and strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing our processes, cost structure and how we operate to ensure that we continue to balance growth with profitability in a challenging industry environment marked by cost pressure driven by inflation and other factors.
​ We expect that the proposed divesture will result in (i) a reduction of our current workforce by approximately
13
employees, and (ii) approximately $ 0.3
million in writedowns of inventory and approximately $ 0.5
million in impairment of certain property plant and equipment. We estimate that approximately $ 0.4
million of impairment and other charges will be recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 if closing conditions are satisfied. ​ We expect predominantly all of the actions associated with the divestiture to be completed, and substantially all the associated charges and cash expenditures to be incurred, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.
​ The estimates of the charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with the proposed divestiture, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the proposed divestiture. ​
Restructuring of Operations in Mexico and the United States ​ On March 6, 2023, we announced our plans to restructure certain corporate and administrative functions and consolidate activities in our Grown distribution network. We estimate that the proposed restructuring will incur approximately $ 1.9
million in charges and future cash expenditures, consisting primarily of cash expenditures related to severance payments and implementation costs. We expect predominantly all of the actions associated with the proposed restructuring to be completed, and substantially all the associated charges and cash expenditures to be incurred, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.
​ The estimates of the charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with the proposed restructuring, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the proposed restructuring. ​ When the proposed restructuring is fully implemented, we expect to realize cash savings of approximately $ 1.2
million in operating expenses, primarily related to employee cash compensation and benefits, over the next 12 months.

​ Recent Developments ​ Dividend payment ​ In November 2022, we announced that we will begin declaring and paying dividends quarterly rather than annually as had been our practice. On December 14, 2022, we paid a dividend of $0.2875 per share, or an aggregate of $5.2 million, to shareholders of record on November 16, 2022. Litigation ​ From time to time, we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. ​ Calavo Salsa Lisa ​ On March 6, 2023, we announced our plans to divest our salsa business in our Prepared segment.

Table of Contents and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the proposed restructuring. ​ When the proposed restructuring is fully implemented, we expect to realize cash savings of approximately $1.2 million in operating expenses, primarily related to employee cash compensation and benefits, over the next 12 months.
​ Mexican IVA taxes receivable ​ Historically, CDM received IVA refund payments from the Mexican tax authorities on a timely basis. Beginning in fiscal 2014 and continuing into fiscal 2022, the tax authorities began objecting to refund requests and supporting documentation that had previously been deemed acceptable to process a refund. Additionally, they are also questioning the refunds requested attributable to IVA paid to certain suppliers that allegedly did not fulfill their own tax obligations. We believe these factors and others have contributed to delays in the processing of IVA claims by the Mexican tax authorities.
Currently, we are in the process of collecting such balances primarily through regular administrative processes, but these amounts may ultimately need to be recovered through Administrative Appeals and/or legal means.
​
In January 2023 the Federal Tax Court issued a definitive resolution confirming the ruling from April 2022, ordering SAT to refund approximately $18 million pesos (approx. $1.0 million USD at January 31, 2023) and confirming that the $6.9 million pesos (approx. $0.4 million USD at January 31, 2023) related to packing materials will not be recoverable.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, we recognized a reserve of $1.4 million for Mexican IVA tax receivables related to certain packing material vendors corresponding to the years 2013 and 2015. This reserve includes the amounts included in the January 2023 ruling as well as other similar receivables that are subject to proceedings in this same Federal Tax Court. ​
We believe that our operations in Mexico are properly documented, and our internationally recognized tax advisors believe that there are legal grounds to prevail in collecting the corresponding IVA amounts. With assistance from our internationally recognized tax advisory firm, as of January 31, 2023, CDM has filed Administrative Appeals for months for which IVA refunds have been denied by the SAT, and will continue filing such appeals for any months for which refunds are denied in the future. Therefore, it is probable that the Mexican tax authorities will ultimately authorize the refund of the remaining IVA amounts. ​ Critical Accounting Estimates
​ In preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and costs and expenses that are reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. ​ There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to those disclosed in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. ​ Non-GAAP Financial Measures ​ The below tables include non-GAAP measures EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, which are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP.”
​ 20
Table of Contents EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) interest income and expense, (2) income taxes (benefit) provision, (3) depreciation and amortization and (4) stock-based compensation expense.
Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA with further adjustments for (1) non-cash net losses recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items.
Adjusted EBITDA is a primary metric by which management evaluates the operating performance of the business, on which certain operating expenditures and internal budgets are based and by which, in addition to other factors, the Company’s senior management is compensated. The adjustments to calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are items recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded.
​ Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) non-cash net losses recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted net income (loss) and the related measure of adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share exclude certain items that are recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. We believe adjusted net income (loss) affords investors a different view of the overall financial performance of the Company than adjusted EBITDA and the GAAP measure of net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. ​ Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables below. ​ Items are considered one-time in nature if they are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with SEC rules.
One-time items are identified in the notes to the reconciliations in the financial tables below. ​ Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
None of these metrics are presented as measures of liquidity. The way the Company measures EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in Company agreements. ​ 21

​ For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the decrease in Grown product sales was primarily due to a decrease in price per unit of avocados offset by higher sales volume due to higher volumes of available fruit.
For the three months
23
Table of Contents ended January 31, 2023, the decrease in Prepared product sales was due primarily to decreased sales volume from fresh-cut fruit products and guacamole products.
​ Our Grown and Prepared segments of our business are subject to seasonal trends which can impact the volume and/or quality of raw materials sourced in any particular quarter.
​ Grown products ​ First Quarter 2023 vs. First Quarter 2022 ​ Net sales for the Grown products business decreased by approximately $44.5 million, or 27%, for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022.
The decrease in Grown product sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily related to lower sales prices of avocados due to higher overall supply of avocados in the marketplace.
Partially offsetting this decrease, tomato sales increased due to an increase in sales prices per carton, due to lower supply of tomatoes in the marketplace.
​ Sales of avocados decreased $48.4 million, or 32%, for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year period.
The average avocado sales price per carton decreased 35% compared to the prior year period.
The decrease in the sales price per carton was mainly due to an industry-wide increase in supply of avocados in the marketplace. The volume of avocados sold in the first quarter of 2023 increased 3% compared to the prior year period.
​ Sales of tomatoes increased $3.6 million, or 36%, for the first quarter of 2023, when compared to the prior year period.
The increase in tomato sales was primarily due to a 33% increase in the sales price per carton, due to lower supply of tomatoes in the marketplace. ​ Prepared products ​ First Quarter 2023 vs. First Quarter 2022 ​ Net sales for the Prepared products business decreased by approximately $3.7 million, or 3%, for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022.
This decrease in Prepared product sales during the three months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily related to lower sales volume of fresh-cut fruit & vegetables, prepared foods and guacamole products.
​ Net sales for fresh-cut products decreased $1.8 million, or 2%, for the quarter ended January 31, 2022 compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by lower sales volume of 12%, partially offset by an increase of 11% of sales prices.
Net sales for guacamole products decreased $2.0 million, or 12%, for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the total volume of pounds sold.

​ Gross profit increased by approximately $1.2 million, or 9%, for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a gross profit increase in the Prepared segment, partially offset, by a gross profit decrease in the Grown segment. ​ Grown products ​ The decrease in our Grown products gross profit for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 was the result of decreased gross profit for avocados, partially offset, by a gross profit increase in tomatoes. Overall gross profit decreased for avocados as did gross profit per carton, while the overall gross profit percentage increased. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the gross profit percentage for avocados was 7.9% compared to 7.1% for the first quarter of 2022.
The increase in gross profit percentage was largely a formulaic result as the decrease in sales prices for avocados was proportionately greater than the decrease in gross profit per case. ​ Gross profit for the quarter was also affected by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Mexican peso during the quarter, resulting in a $1.3 million net gain related the remeasurement of peso-dominated net assets at our Mexican subsidiaries. This is in comparison to a remeasurement loss of $0.6 million for the same period last year.
​ Note that any additional significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross profits for our Grown products segment. ​ Prepared products ​ The increase in our Prepared products gross profit for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was the result of increased gross profit for fresh-cut fruit & vegetables, prepared foods and guacamole products. ​ Fresh-cut fruit & vegetables and prepared foods products gross profit percentage for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was 1.4%, compared to a loss of (0.7)% for the same prior year period.
The increases in gross profit for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were mainly due to increased sales prices, a reduction in distribution expenses, and labor productivity. ​ 25
Table of Contents Guacamole products gross profit percentage for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was 25.9%, compared to a gross profit of 14.4% for the prior year period. The increase in guacamole products gross profit was due primarily to lower raw product fruit costs and lower manufacturing costs. Any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Prepared segment.

Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended January 31, 2023 reflect primarily our net loss of $2.8 million, plus add-backs for non-cash activities (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for losses on accounts receivable, losses from unconsolidated entities, loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, and gain on the sale of the Temecula packinghouse) of $6.7 million and net cash used in the components of our working capital of approximately $9.7 million. ​ Decreases in operating cash flows caused by working capital changes include an increase in inventory of $5.3 million, an increase in other assets of $4.1 million, a decrease in payable to growers of $4.1 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $3.2 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.1 million, and an

Table of Contents increase in income taxes receivable of $0.7 million, partially offset by a net increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $7.0 million and a decrease in advances to suppliers of $2.7 million. ​ The increase in our inventory as of January 31, 2023, when compared to October 31, 2022, is primarily due to higher inventory of Mexican Avocados. The decrease in payable to growers is mostly due to decreased cost per unit, resulting from increased supply for Mexican avocados in the month of January 2023 compared to October 2022. The increase in our accounts receivable is due to an increase in sales for the month of January 2023 compared to October 2022. The increase in other assets as of January 31, 2023, when compared to October 31, 2022, is primarily due to an increase in Mexican IVA taxes receivable. The increase in income taxes receivable is due to the tax impact of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 results. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily related to an increase in payables related to an increase in sales volume in January 2023 compared to October 2022. The decrease in advances to suppliers is mainly due to the offsetting liabilities incurred on the sales of tomatoes to our consignment growers. ​ Cash used in investing activities was $5.2 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, which related to purchases of property, plant, and equipment. ​ Cash provided by financing activities was $9.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, which related principally to net receipts on our credit facilities totaling $15.2 million, partially offset by the payment of a $5.1 million dividend and payments on long-term obligations of $0.4 million. ​ Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash reserves, cash generated from operations and amounts available for borrowing under our existing credit facilities.
Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 totaled $1.8 million and $3.1 million. Our working capital at January 31, 2023 was $27.8 million, compared to $23.7 million at October 31, 2022. ​ We believe that cash flows from operations, the available Credit Facility, and other sources will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditures, grower recruitment efforts, working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months.
We will continue to pursue grower recruitment opportunities and expand relationships with retail and/or foodservice customers to fuel growth in each of our business segments.
We have a revolving credit facility with Bank of America as administrative agent and Farm Credit West as joint lead arranger. Under the terms of this agreement, we may draw on funds for both working capital and long-term productive asset purchases.
Total credit available under this agreement, subject to borrowing base calculations, is $80 million, and it expires in January 2026. For our Credit Facility the weighted-average interest rate was
6.2 % and 4.9% at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.
Under the Credit Facility we had $16.4 million and $1.2 million outstanding as January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. ​ On November 1, 2022, we entered into a Seventh Amendment to our Credit Facility, which permitted us to declare cash dividends so long as (i) after giving effect to any such dividend a new Consolidated Dividend Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is not less than 1.20 to 1.00 and (ii) any such cash dividends are paid in the same fiscal quarter in which they are declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing restriction, we may declare and make a dividend payment in an amount not to exceed $5,200,000 on or before January 31, 2023.   ​ As of January 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants as in effect on that date, and we expect to remain in compliance. As of January 31, 2023, approximately $26.0 million was available for borrowing based on our borrowing base calculation discussed above.
​ Contractual Commitments ​ There have been no other material changes to our contractual commitments from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. For a summary of the contractual commitments at October 31, 2022, see Part II, Item 7, in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ ​ ​ 27

​ Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, payable to growers, accounts payable, current and long-term borrowings pursuant to our Credit Facility, and long-term, fixed-rate obligations.
All of our financial instruments are entered into during the normal course of operations and have not been acquired for trading purposes.

​ We were not a party to any derivative instruments during the fiscal year.
It is currently our practice not to use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Additionally, we do not use any hedging or forward contracts to offset market volatility.
​ Our Mexican-based operations transact a significant portion of business in Mexican pesos.
Funds are transferred by our corporate office to Mexico on a weekly basis to satisfy Mexican cash needs. We do not currently use derivative instruments to hedge fluctuations in the Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rates.
Management does, however, evaluate this opportunity from time to time.
Total foreign currency remeasurement gains for the three months ended January 31, 2023, net of losses, was $1.3 million. Total foreign currency remeasurement losses for the three months ended January 31, 2022, net of gains, was $0.6 million.
​ ITEM 4 . CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
