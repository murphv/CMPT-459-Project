Notes

For
the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
(unaudited)
1.
Background
Information
BioVie
Inc. (the “Company” or “we” or “our”) is a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies
to treat chronic debilitating conditions including neurological and neuro-degenerative disorders and liver disease.
The
Company acquired the biopharmaceutical assets of NeurMedix, Inc. (“NeurMedix”), a privately held clinical-stage pharmaceutical
company, in June 2021 (See Note 5 Related Party Transactions ).
The acquired assets included NE3107, a potentially selective inhibitor
of inflammatory extracellular single-regulated kinase(“ERK”) signaling that, based on animal studies, is believed to reduce
neuroinflammation. NE3107 is a novel orally administered small molecule that is thought to inhibit inflammation-driven insulin resistance
and major pathological inflammatory cascades with a novel mechanism of action. There is emerging scientific consensus that both inflammation
and insulin resistance may play fundamental roles in the development of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease
(PD), and NE3107 could, if approved represent an entirely new medical approach to treating these devastating conditions affecting an
estimated 6 million Americans suffering from AD and 1 million Americans suffering from PD. In August 2021, the Company initiated the
FDA authorized potentially pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study to evaluate
NE3107 in subjects who have mild to moderate AD (NCT04669028). The Company is targeting primary completion of this study in the third
quarter of calendar year 2023.
In
December 2022, the Company released topline results from its Phase 2 study assessing NE3107’s safety and tolerability and potential
pro-motoric impact in Parkinson’s disease patients. The NM201 study (NCT05083260) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety,
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics study in PD participants treated with carbidopa/levodopa and NE3107. Forty-five patients with a defined
L-dopa “off state” were randomized 1:1 to placebo: NE3107 20 mg twice daily for 28 days. The trial was launched with two
design objectives: 1) the primary objectives are safety and a drug-drug interaction study (as requested by the FDA) to demonstrate the
absence of adverse interactions of NE3107 with levodopa; and 2) the secondary objective is to determine if preclinical indications of
promotoric activity and apparent enhancement of levodopa activity can be seen in humans. Both objectives of the study were met. The Company
continues to process its findings from its completed NM201 study as it prepares for the next round of clinical studies in PD.
Neuroinflammation,
insulin resistance, and oxidative stress are common features in the major neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, frontotemporal
lobar dementia, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). NE3107 is an oral small molecule, blood-brain permeable, compound with potential
anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitizing, and ERK-binding properties that may allow it to selectively inhibit ERK-, NFκB- and TNF-stimulated
inflammation. NE3107’s potential to inhibit neuroinflammation and insulin resistance forms the basis for the Company’s work
testing the molecule in AD and PD patients. NE3107 is patented in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe and South Korea.
The Company’s Orphan drug candidate BIV201
(continuous infusion terlipressin), with FDA Fast Track status, is being evaluated in a US Phase 2b study for the treatment of refractory
ascites due to liver cirrhosis with top-line results anticipated in mid-2023. BIV201 is administered as a patent-pending liquid formulation.
The active agent is approved in the U.S. and in about 40 countries for related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis.
The
BIV201 development program was initiated by LAT Pharma LLC (“LAT Pharma”). On April 11, 2016, the Company acquired LAT Pharma
and the rights to its BIV201 development program. The Company currently owns all development and marketing rights to this drug candidate.
Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on April 11, 2016, between our predecessor entities, LAT Pharma and NanoAntibiotics,
Inc., BioVie is obligated to pay a low single digit royalty on net sales of BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), if approved, to
be shared by the members of LAT Pharma, PharmaIn Corporation and The Barrett Edge, Inc

Liquidity
The
Company’s operations are subject to a number of factors that can affect its operating results and financial conditions. Such factors
include, but are not limited to: the results of clinical testing and trial activities; the Company’s ability to obtain regulatory
approval to market its products; competition from products manufactured and sold or being developed by other companies; the price of,
and demand for, Company products, if approved; the Company’s ability to negotiate favorable licensing or other manufacturing and
marketing agreements for its products, if approved; and the Company’s ability to raise capital to support its operations. The Company’s
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital
of approximately $ 38.2
million, cash of approximately $ 45.7
million, stockholders’ equity of approximately
$ 26.1
million, and an accumulated deficit of approximately
$ 277.1
million. The Company has not generated
any revenue to date and no revenue is expected in the foreseeable future. The Company’s future operations are dependent on the
success of the Company’s ongoing development and commercialization efforts, as well as its ability to secure additional financing
as needed. Although our cash balance may sustain operations over the next 12 months from the balance sheet date if measures
are taken to delay planned expenditures in our research protocols and slow the progress in the Company’s clinical programs, the
Company’s current planned operations to meet certain goals and objectives project cash flows to be depleted within that period
of time.
Management
expects that future sources of funding may include sales of equity, obtaining loans, or other strategic transactions.
The
duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-term impact of COVID-19 and any variants on the financial markets and the overall
economy continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy are
impacted for an extended period, the Company’s ability to raise funds may be materially adversely affected. In addition, the COVID-19
pandemic has created a widespread labor shortage, including a shortage of medical professionals, and has impacted and may continue to
impact the potential patient participation in our studies, which may adversely impact our ability to continue or complete our clinical
trials on the Company’s planned timeline.
Although
management continues to pursue the Company’s strategic plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining
sufficient financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all, to fund continuing operations. These circumstances raise substantial
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Significant
Accounting Policies
Basis
of Presentation – Interim Financial Information
These
unaudited interim condensed financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United State of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Interim Reporting. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim
condensed financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) that are, in the opinion of
management, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the full year. The condensed balance sheet at June 30, 2022 was derived from audited annual financial statements
but does not contain all the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements. These unaudited interim condensed financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 27, 2022. For a summary of significant accounting policies, see the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on September 27, 2022 (the “2022
Form 10-K”).
Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.

Table of Contents
Net
loss per Common Share
Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
shares of Class A common stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share (“common stock”), outstanding during the period. Diluted net
loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that
could occur from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants, and convertible debentures. For the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, such amounts were excluded from the diluted loss since their effect was considered anti-dilutive due to the
net loss for the period.
The
table below shows the number of outstanding stock options and warrants as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

issued and outstanding common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the APA, as amended, the Company may now be obligated to
deliver contingent stock consideration to NeurMedix (or its successor) consisting of up to 18 million shares of the Company’s common
stock, with 4.5 million shares issuable upon the achievement of each of the four milestones set forth in the APA, subject to a cap limiting

The
Loan Agreement requires monthly interest-only payments during the first eighteen months of the term of the Loan. Following the
interest-only period, the Company will make equal monthly payments of principal, plus accrued interest, until the Loan’s
maturity date when all remaining principal and accrued interest is due. If the Company prepays the Loan, it will be required to pay
(a) a prepayment fee in an amount equal to 3.0% of the principal amount of the Loan that is prepaid during the interest-only period;
and (b) a prepayment fee in an amount equal to 1.0% of the principal amount of the Loan that is prepaid after the interest-only
period. At the Loan’s maturity date, or on the date of the prepayment of the Loan, the
Company will be obligated to pay
a final payment equal to 4.25% of the Loan commitment amount, the sum of Tranche 1 and Tranche 2.

Warrants”) at an exercise price per share equal to $5.82. The Avenue Warrants are exercisable until November 30, 2026.
The
amount of the carrying value of the notes payable was determined by allocating portions of the outstanding principal of the notes;
approximately $ 1.4
million to the fair value of the Avenue Warrants and approximately $ 2.2
million to the fair value of the embedded conversion option.
Accordingly, the total amount of unearned discount of approximately $ 3.7
million, the total direct financing cost of approximately $ 390,000
and premium of $ 850,000
are recognized on an effective interest method over the term of the Loan. The adjusted effective interest rate is 25%. The total
interest expense of approximately $ 1.1
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was recognized in the accompanying statements of operations and included the
interest only payments totaling approximately $ 518,000 ,

unearned discount of approximately $ 400,000
and the accretion of loan premium of approximately $93,000. The total interest expense of approximately $ 2.1
million for the six- months ended December 31, 2022, was recognized in the accompanying statements of operations and included
interest only payments totaling approximately $ 987,000 ,
the amortization of financing costs of approximately $ 85,000 ,
unearned discount of approximately $ 800,000
and the accretion of loan premium of approximately $237,000.

The
fair values of derivative liabilities for the Avenue Warrants and conversion option at December 31, 2022 in the accompanying balance
sheet, were approximately $1.8 million and approximately $2.3 million, respectively. The total change in the fair value of the
derivative liabilities totaled approximately $3.2 million and $3.8 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022,
respectively; and accordingly, was recorded in the accompanying statement of operations. The assumptions used in the Black Scholes
model to value the derivative liabilities at December 31, 2022 included the closing stock price of $ 7.77
per share; for the Avenue Warrants, the exercise price of $ 5.82 ,
4 -year
term, risk free rate of
4.11 %
and volatility of
78.5 %;
and for the embedded derivative liability of the conversion option, the conversion price of $ 6.98 ;
2 -year
term, risk free rate of
4.41 %
and volatility of
66.9 %.
Derivative
liability – Avenue Warrants
The
Company accounts for stock purchase warrants as either equity instruments or derivative liabilities depending on the specific terms of
the warrant agreements. Under applicable accounting guidance, stock warrants that are precluded from being indexed to the Company’s
own stock because of full-rachet and anti-dilution provisions or adjustments to the strike price due to an occurrence of a future event are accounted for as derivative financial instruments. The
Avenue Warrants were not considered to be indexed to the Company’s own stock, and accordingly, were recorded as a derivative liability at fair
value in the accompany balance sheet at December 31, 2022.
The
Black Scholes model was used to calculate the fair value of the warrant derivative to bifurcate the warrant derivative amount from
the Avenue Loan amount funded. The Avenue Warrants are recorded at their fair values at the date of issuance and remeasured at
December 31, 2022. The assumptions used for the fair value calculation at November 30, 2021 included: the closing stock price of
$ 6.44
per share; the exercise price of $ 5.82 ;
5
year term; a risk free rate of
1.14 %
and volatility of
74.4 %.
Embedded
derivative liability – Conversion Option
The embedded derivative liability represents the
optional conversion feature of up to $5.0 million of the outstanding Loan, which meets the definition of a derivative and requires bifurcation
from the loan amount.
The
Black Scholes model was used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivative to bifurcate the embedded derivative amount representing
the conversion option from the Loan amount funded. The assumption used for the fair value calculation at November 30, 2021 included:
the closing stock price of $ 6.44
per share; the conversion price of $ 6.98 ;
3
year term; risk free rate of
0.81 % and volatility of
76.85 %.

the Company modified a former employee’s stock option award granted on August 20, 2021 pursuant to the 2019 Omnibus Plan (“2021
Options Grant”). Pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement, effective on July 8, 2022 (“the Separation Date”),
the Company accelerated the vesting of options scheduled to vest on the first and second anniversary of the grant date as deemed vested
(“Accelerated Options”) and after giving effect to the Accelerated Options, extended the exercise period of the total vested
outstanding and unexercised options (totaling 74,500 options) to one year following the Separation Date. The unvested portion of the
2021 Option Grant (totaling 49,667 options) was canceled. The modification was remeasured as of July 8, 2022 and the incremental difference
totaled $181,154, net credit, due to the original exercise price of $7.74 being greater than the stock price of $1.80 on the remeasurement
date, and accordingly was recognized on July 8, 2022.
On
December 6, 2022, the Company granted stock options to purchase
10,000
shares of common stock to a new employee. Twenty percent (20%)
of the shares underlying the options awarded vest on the one year anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining 80% vest in equal
monthly installments over
48
month. The exercise price is $ 5.21
per share, the grant date fair value, and the options terminate on the
tenth anniversary of the grant date.

Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
Management’s
Discussion
BioVie
Inc. (the “Company” or “we” or “our”) is a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies
to treat chronic debilitating conditions including neurological and neuro-degenerative disorders and liver disease.
In neurodegenerative disease, the Company acquired the biopharmaceutical
assets of NeurMedix, Inc. (“NeurMedix”), a privately held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, in June 2021 (See Note 5
Related Party Transactions ).
The acquired assets included NE3107, a potentially selective inhibitor of inflammatory extracellular
single-regulated kinase (“ERK”) signaling that, based on animal studies, is believed to reduce neuroinflammation. NE3107 is
a novel orally administered small molecule that is thought to inhibit inflammation-driven insulin resistance and major pathological inflammatory
cascades with a novel mechanism of action. There is emerging scientific consensus that both inflammation and insulin resistance may play
fundamental roles in the development of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD), and NE3107 could, if approved,
represent an entirely new medical approach to treating these devastating conditions affecting an estimated 6 million Americans suffering
from AD and 1 million Americans suffering from PD. In August 2021, the Company initiated the FDA authorized potentially pivotal Phase
3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study to evaluate NE3107 in subjects who have mild to moderate
Alzheimer’s disease (NCT04669028). The Company is targeting primary completion of this study in the third quarter of calendar year
2023.
In December 2022, the Company released topline
results from its Phase 2 study assessing NE3107’s safety and tolerability and potential pro-motoric impact in PD patients. The NM201
study (NCT05083260) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics study in PD participants treated
with carbidopa/levodopa and NE3107. Forty-five patients with a defined L-dopa “off state” were randomized 1:1 to placebo:NE3107
20 mg twice daily for 28 days. The trial was launched with two design objectives: 1) the primary objectives are safety and a drug-drug
interaction study (as requested by the FDA) to demonstrate the absence of adverse interactions of NE3107 with levodopa; and 2) the secondary
objective is to determine if preclinical indications of promotoric activity and apparent enhancement of levodopa activity can be seen
in humans. Both objectives of the study were met. The Company continues to process its findings from its completed NM201 study as it prepares
for the next round of clinical studies in PD.
In
liver disease, the Company’s Orphan drug candidate BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), with FDA Fast Track status, is being
evaluated in a US Phase 2b study for the treatment of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis with top-line results anticipated in
mid-2023. BIV201 is administered as a patent-pending liquid formulation. The active agent is approved in the U.S. and in about 40 countries
for related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis.

Comparison
of the three months ended December 31, 2022 to the three months ended December 31, 2021
Net
loss
The net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately
$15.7 million as compared $5.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net loss of approximately $10.3
million was primarily due to increased losses from operations of $4.8 million due to increased clinical activities, an increase in interest
expense of approximately $737,000 million from the notes payable financing obtained in November 2021 and a change in fair value of derivative
liabilities of approximately $4.8 million.
Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022
were approximately $11.5 million as compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The net
increase of approximately $4.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to an increase in research and
development expenses of approximately $2.3 million due to increased clinical activities and an increase in selling general and
administrative expenses of approximately $2.5 million.
Research
and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were approximately $7.0 million and $4.7
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net increase of approximately $2.3 million, was comprised
of a net increase in clinical study activities of approximately $1.4 million, offset by a decline in other development activities of approximately
$526,000 ; and increase in Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control of approximately $542,000, and an increase in compensation expense of
approximately $973,000 related to the Company’s expansion of the clinical team and consultants supporting its increased clinical
activities over the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in research and development expenses of $1.3 million was primarily
due to the Neuroscience NE3107 studies, which were significantly more active during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared
to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Parkinson’s Phase 2 study initiated in January 2022, became fully enrolled with
the top-line data read reported in December 2022 and the Alzheimer Phase 3 study is approaching full enrollment. Our Orphan drug candidate
BIV201’s Phase 2b study, which was initiated in June 2021, accounted for approximately $100,000 of the net increase in research
and development expenses for three months ended December 31, 2022.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $4.4 million
and $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net increase of approximately $2.5 million was
primarily attributed to increased stock compensation expense of approximately $1.7 million related to the board of directors’ annual
compensation, a net increase in management compensation expenses of approximately $342,000, due to an increase in staff from 2 to 4 persons,
and equity awards granted in the three months ended December 31, 2022, and increased legal, investor advisory and other professional fees
totaling approximately $478,000.
Other
Income and Expense
Other expense, net was $4.2 million for the three months ended December
31, 2022 compared to other income of $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The net increase in other expense of $5.5
million was due to an increase in interest expense of approximately $737,000, which was attributed to the $15 million debt financing obtained
in November 2021 and the change in fair value of the related derivative liabilities recognized for the three months ended December 31,
2022 was approximately $4.8 million.
Comparison
of the six months ended December 31, 2022 to the six months ended December 31, 2021
Net
loss
The net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately
$26.1 million as compared to $11.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net loss of approximately $15.1
million was primarily due to increased losses from operations of $8.1 million due to increased clinical activities, an increase in interest
expense of approximately $1.8 million from the notes payable financing obtained in November 2021, and a change in fair value of derivative
liabilities of approximately $5.3 million.
Total operating expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were
approximately $20.3 million as compared to $12.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021.  The net increase of approximately
$8.1 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was due to an increase in research and development expenses of approximately
$6.0 million due to our increased clinical activities, and an increase in selling general and administrative expenses of approximately
$2.0 million.
Research
and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were approximately $13.8 million and
$7.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net increase of approximately $6.0 million, was comprised
of a net increase of $5.4 million from increased clinical activities, offset by a decline in other development activities of approximately
$543,000, an increase in Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control expense of approximately $542,000, and an increase in compensation expense
of approximately $537,000 due to the Company’s expansion of the clinical team and consultants supporting our increased clinical
activities over the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in research and development expenses of $5.3 million was
primarily due to the Neuroscience NE3107 studies, which were significantly more active during the six months ended December 31, 2022
compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The Parkinson’s Phase 2 study initiated in January 2022, became fully enrolled,
with the top-line data read reported in December 2022, and the Alzheimer Phase 3 study is approaching full enrollment. Our Orphan drug
candidate BIV201’s Phase 2b study, which was initiated in June 2021, accounted for approximately $100,000 of the net increase in
research and development expenses for six months ended December 31, 2022.

General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $6.4 million
and $4.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net increase of approximately $2.1 million was
primarily attributed to increased stock compensation expense of approximately $1.8 million related to the board of directors’ annual
compensation; a net increase in legal, investor relations and other professional fees totaling approximately $462,000, an increase in
management compensation expense of approximately $477,000 due to an increase in staff from two to four persons, offset by stock compensation
expense of approximately $758,000.
Other
Income and Expense
Other expense, net was $5.8 million for the six months ended December 31,
2022 compared to other income of $1.3 million. The net increase in other expense of $7.1 million represented an increase in interest
expense of approximately $1.8 million attributed to the $15 million debt financing obtained in November 2021 and the change in fair value
of the related derivative liabilities recognized for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $5.3 million.

Capital
Resources and Liquidity
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of approximately $45.7 million,
working capital of approximately $38.2 million, stockholders’ equity of approximately $26.1 million, and an accumulated deficit
of approximately $277.1 million. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold 4.3 million shares of its common stock
under its Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co and B. Riley Securities, Inc. for total net proceeds
of $32.5 million after 3% commissions and cost totaling approximately $1.2 million.
The Company has not generated any revenues and no revenues are expected
in the foreseeable future. The Company’s future operations are dependent on the success of the Company’s ongoing development
and commercialization efforts, as well as its ability to secure additional financing.  Management expects that future sources
of funding may include sales of equity, obtaining loans, or other strategic transactions.
The duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-term impact
of COVID-19 and its variants on the financial markets and the overall economy continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted
at this time. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy are impacted for an extended period, the Company’s ability to
raise funds may be materially adversely affected. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a widespread labor shortage, including
a shortage of medical professionals, and has impacted and may continue to impact the potential patient participation in our studies, which
may adversely impact our ability to continue or complete our clinical trials in the planned timeline.
Although
management continues to pursue the Company’s strategic plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining
sufficient financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all, to fund continuing operations. These circumstances raise substantial
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures
We
maintain “disclosure controls and procedures.” Such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Office and Chief Financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls
and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures,
our management necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure and
procedures. The design of and disclosure controls and procedures also are based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.
Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15f and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that

1A. Risk Factors
Except
as described below, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K. The risks described
in our Form 10-K and below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or
that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results.
Risks
Relating to Our Business and Industry
If
the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic versions of any of our product candidates that receive marketing
approval, or such authorities do not grant our products sufficient, or any, periods of exclusivity before approving generic versions
of our products, the sales of our products could be adversely affected.
Once
a new drug application (“NDA”) is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a “reference listed drug” or
RLD, in the FDA’s publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” commonly known as
the Orange Book. Other manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference listed drugs through submission of abbreviated
new drug applications (“ANDAs”) in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical
trials. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of
administration and conditions of use or labeling as the reference listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference
listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as the RLD. Generic products may be significantly
less costly to bring to market than the reference listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer
them at lower prices. Moreover, generic versions of RLDs are often automatically substituted for the RLD by pharmacies when dispensing
a prescription written for the RLD. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any
branded product or reference listed drug is typically lost to the generic product.
The
FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The
U.S. federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug
containing a new chemical entity (“NCE”). An NCE is an active ingredient that has not previously been approved by FDA alone
or in combination with other substances. Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted
to the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV Certification that a patent covering
the reference listed drug is either invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product, in which case the applicant may submit its
application four years following approval of the reference listed drug. If an ANDA is submitted to FDA with a Paragraph IV Certification,
the generic applicant must also provide a Paragraph IV Notification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and to the owner of the listed
patent(s) being challenged by the ANDA applicant, providing a detailed written statement of the basis for the ANDA applicant’s
position that the relevant patent(s) is invalid or would not be infringed. If the patent owner brings a patent infringement lawsuit against
the ANDA applicant within 45 days of the Paragraph IV Notification, FDA approval of the ANDA will be automatically stayed for 30 months,
or until 7-1/2 years after the NDA approval if the generic application was filed between 4 years and 5 years after the NDA approval.
Any such stay will be terminated earlier if the court rules that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed.
Competition
that our products may face from generic versions of our products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability
and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates.

If
we fail to obtain or maintain Orphan Drug exclusivity for BIV201, we will have to rely on other potential marketing exclusivity, and
on our intellectual property rights, which may reduce the length of time that we can prevent competitors from selling generic versions
of BIV201.
We
have obtained Orphan Drug Designation for BIV201 (terlipressin) in the U.S. for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (received November
21, 2018) and treatment of ascites due to all etiologies except cancer (received September 8, 2016). Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA
may designate a product as an Orphan Drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined, in part, as a patient
population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. In the EU, Orphan Drug designation may be granted to drugs intended to treat, diagnose or
prevent a life-threatening or chronically debilitating disease having a prevalence of no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, and
which meet other specified criteria. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated Orphan Drug for the associated rare
disease may receive a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which time FDA may not approve another application for the same
drug for the same orphan disease or condition. Orphan Drug Exclusivity does not prevent FDA approval of another application for the same
drug for a different disease or condition, or of an application for a different drug for the same rare disease or condition. Orphan Drug
exclusive marketing rights may be lost under several circumstances, including a later determination by the FDA that the request for designation
was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. Similar regulations are available
in the EU with a ten-year period of market exclusivity.
Even
though BioVie has obtained two Orphan Drug Designations for its lead product candidate, terlipressin, for treatment of ascites and for
treatment of HRS, and may seek other Orphan Drug Designations for BIV201, and Orphan Drug Designation for other product candidates, there
is no assurance that BioVie will be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular rare indication. Further, even though BioVie
has obtained Orphan Drug Designations for its lead product candidate, or even if BioVie obtains Orphan Drug Designation for other potential
product candidates, such designation may not effectively protect BioVie from competition because different drugs can be approved for
the same condition and the same drug can be approved for different conditions and potentially used off-label in the Orphan indication.
Even after an Orphan Drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve another competing drug with the same active ingredient for the
same condition for several reasons, including, if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior due to being safer or
more effective or because it makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time
or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.
In
fact, Mallinckrodt recently received an NDA approval for its terlipressin product for the hepatorenal syndrome (“HRS”) indication
in September 2022, which is the same indication for which we had received an Orphan Designation. FDA granted Mallinckrodt and its approved
drug a new chemical entity exclusivity. Similarly, if another company with an Orphan Drug designation for the same drug as ours for the
same proposed disease or condition receives FDA approval and orphan drug exclusivity before our product is approved, approval of our
drug(s) for the orphan indication may be blocked for seven years by the other company’s orphan drug exclusivity and they may obtain
a competitive advantage even after the exclusivity period expires associated with being the first to market.
We
may face business disruption and related risks if there is another surge ofCOVID-19 or if there is another pandemic caused by other bacteria
or viruses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business plan.
Health
emergencies or pandemics, whether from COVID-19 or other viruses or bacteria, may lead to regional quarantines, business shutdowns, labor
shortages, disruptions to supply chains, and overall economic instability, which could materially and adversely affect the clinical trials,
supply chain, financial condition and financial performance of our company. The duration and spread of a pandemic and its long-term impact
on the financial markets and the overall economy are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the financial markets and/or the overall
economy are impacted for an extended period, the Company’s ability to raise funds may be materially adversely affected. In addition,
such health emergencies or pandemics may create a widespread labor shortage, including a shortage of medical professionals, and may impact
potential patient participation in our studies which may adversely impact our ability to continue or complete our clinical trials in
the planned timeline.
We
can provide no assurance that our product candidates will obtain regulatory approval or that the results of clinical studies will be
favorable.
The
business plan we have developed through June 2024 for the liver disease program is to complete the Phase 2b clinical development program
for our lead new product candidate BIV201 for treatment of ascites, conduct a single pivotal Phase 3 trial of BIV201 for ascites, and
to pursue other key milestones such as additional patent issuances. For NE3107, we have commenced a potentially pivotal 18-month Phase
3 trial in Alzheimer’s disease, commenced a Phase 2 study of NE3017 in Parkinson’s disease. Due to our financial constraints,
we do not have the resources necessary to complete all of these clinical studies. Subject to FDA guidance, we plan to commence additional
Phase 2 and potentially Phase 3 clinical trials upon receipt of a successful capital raise. There is no guarantee the FDA will approve
the commencement of a Phase 3 trial for BIV201, and even if it does, our financial constraints may prevent us from undertaking clinical
trials.

We
rely and will continue to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out
their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize our product
candidates.
We
depend, and will continue to depend, on contract research organizations (“CROs”), clinical trial sites and clinical trial
principal investigators, contract laboratories, and other third parties to conduct our clinical trials. We rely heavily on these third
parties over the course of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible
for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the protocol and applicable legal, regulatory, and scientific standards
and regulations, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties
are required to comply with
current good clinical practices
(“cGCPs”), which
are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the conduct of clinical trials on
product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce cGCPs through periodic inspections and for-cause inspections
of clinical trial principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCPs or
fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials to support our marketing applications,
which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal,
state, or foreign fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws, or provide us or government
agencies with inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data.
Although
we design the clinical trials for our product candidates, our CROs will facilitate and monitor our clinical trials. As a result, many
important aspects of our clinical development programs, including site and investigator selection, and the conduct and timing and monitoring
of the study, will be partly or completely outside our direct control. Our reliance on third parties to conduct clinical trials will
also result in less direct control over the collection, management, and quality of data developed through clinical trials than would
be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own employees. Communicating with third parties can also be challenging, potentially
leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities.
Any
third parties conducting our clinical trials are not, and will not be, our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our
agreements with these third parties, we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical,
clinical, and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors,
for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our
behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the
quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory
requirements, or if there are other difficulties with such third parties, such as staffing difficulties, changes in priorities, or financial
distress, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated. As a result, we may not be able to complete development of, obtain
regulatory approval of, or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects
for our product candidates will be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.
If
any of our relationships with trial sites, or any CRO that we may use in the future, terminates, we may not be able to timely enter into
arrangements with alternative trial sites or CROs, or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding clinical trial sites
or CROs to conduct our clinical trials involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time, training, and focus. In addition,
there is a natural transition lag when a new third party must learn about our product candidates and protocols, which can result in delays
that may materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.

We
may be unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, and we may be liable for infringing
upon the intellectual property rights of others, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
Our
ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies. We cannot assure investors
that we will continue to innovate and file new patent applications, or that if filed any future patent applications will result in granted
patents with respect to the technology owned by us or licensed to us. Further, we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents
to issue, if at all. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves
complex legal and factual considerations and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents may
be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
BioVie
has also filed a PCT (“Patent Cooperation Treaty”) application covering our novel liquid formulations of terlipressin (international
patent application PCT/US2020/034269 published as WO2020/237170) and we are seeking patent protection in the United States, Europe, China,
Japan and eight other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2022, we have fifteen (15) issued U.S. patents, one (1) pending U.S. patent application,
one (1) pending PCT application and six (6) issued foreign patents directed to protecting NE3107 and related compounds and methods of
making and using thereof. However, there can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, or that
any issued patent claims from pending or future patent applications will be sufficiently broad to protect BIV201, NE3107, or any other
product candidates or to provide us with competitive advantages.
Any
patents we do obtain may be challenged by re-examination or otherwise invalidated or eventually found unenforceable. Both the patent
application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. If we were to initiate legal proceedings
against a third party to enforce a patent related to one of our products, the defendant in such litigation could counterclaim that our
patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability
are commonplace, as are validity challenges by the defendant against the subject patent or other patents before the United States Patent
and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”). Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory
requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement, failure to meet the written description requirement, indefiniteness,
and/or failure to claim patent eligible subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone
connected with prosecution of the patent intentionally withheld material information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement,
during prosecution. Additional grounds for an unenforceability assertion include an allegation of misuse or anticompetitive use of patent
rights, and an allegation of incorrect inventorship with deceptive intent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO
even outside the context of litigation. The outcome is unpredictable following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability. With
respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art existed of which we and the patent
examiner were unaware during prosecution. These assertions may also be based on information known to us or the Patent Office. If a defendant
or third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all,
of the claims of the challenged patent. Such a loss of patent protection would or could have a material adverse impact on our business.
The
standards that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (and foreign countries) use to grant patents are not always applied predictably
or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable
in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or
the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others.
Further,
we rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, technology and nondisclosure, and other contractual agreements and technical measures
to protect our rights in the technology. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed
to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The laws
of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and we may encounter significant
problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
We
do not believe that either BIV201 or NE3107, the product candidates we are currently developing, infringe upon the rights of any third
parties nor are they infringed upon by third parties. However, there can be no assurance that our technology will not be found in the
future to infringe upon the rights of others or be infringed upon by others. Moreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained
in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially
later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. Because patents can take many years
to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products
or product candidates infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that provide support or can be amended to provide support
for a claim that results in an issued patent that our product infringes. In such a case, others may assert infringement claims against
us, and should we be found to infringe upon their patents, or otherwise impermissibly utilize their intellectual property, we might be
forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties’ patent
rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of this intellectual
property. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses or intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms. Even if we are
able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In
that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable
to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected products, which could materially harm our business and the third
parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales,
an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation. Conversely, we may not always be able to successfully
pursue our claims against others that infringe upon our technology. Thus, the proprietary nature of our technology or technology licensed
by us may not provide adequate protection against competitors.

The
pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Moreover,
the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to our patents and other intellectual property rights, even if resolved
in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our management’s efforts. We may not have sufficient resources
to bring any such action to a successful conclusion. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could
limit our ability to continue our operations and you could lose all of your investment.
There
may be conflicts of interest among our officers, directors and stockholders.
Certain
of our executive officers and directors and their affiliates are engaged in other activities and have interests in other entities on
their own behalf or on behalf of other persons. Neither we nor any of our stockholders will have any rights in these ventures or their
income or profits. In particular, our executive officers or directors or their affiliates may have an economic interest in or other business
relationship with partner companies that invest in us or are engaged in competing drug development. Our executive officers or directors
may have conflicting fiduciary duties to us and third parties. The terms of transactions with third parties may not be subject to arm’s
length negotiations and therefore may be on terms less favorable to us than those that could be procured through arm’s length negotiations.
Risks
Relating To Our Common Stock
You
may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or if we issue shares subject to options, warrants, stock awards
or other arrangements.
In
order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into
or exchangeable for our common stock, including under the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”),
dated as of August 31, 2022, by and among the Company, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (collectively, the “Agents”),
pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell from time to time shares of common stock through the Agents. We may sell shares or other
securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the current market price of our securities, and investors purchasing
shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The sale of additional shares of common
stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock would dilute all of our stockholders, and if such sales
of convertible securities into or exchangeable into our common stock occur at a deemed issuance price that is lower than the current
exercise price of our outstanding warrants sold to Acuitas Group Holdings, LLC (“Acuitas”) in August 2022, the exercise price
for those warrants would adjust downward to the deemed issuance price pursuant to price adjustment protection contained within those
warrants.
In
addition, as of December 31, 2022, there were warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 7,770,285 shares of common
stock at exercise prices ranging from $1.82 to $12.50 per share and 3,448,797 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding
options at exercise prices ranging from $1.69 to $42.09 per share. Our Loan Agreement entered into on November 30, 2021
contains a conversion feature whereby at the option of lender, up to $5 million of the outstanding loan amount may be converted into
shares of common stock at a conversion price of $6.98 per share. We may grant additional options, warrants or stock awards. To the
extent such shares are issued, the interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted.
Moreover,
we are obligated to issue shares of common stock upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect
to certain of our drug candidates (i.e., NE3107, NE3291, NE3413, and NE3789) pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, dated April 27,
2021, by and among the Company, NeurMedix, Inc. and Acuitas, as amended on May 9, 2021.
The achievement of these milestones could result in the issuance of up to 18 million shares of our common stock, further diluting the
interest of holders of our common stock.
Certain
stockholders who are also officers and directors of the Company may have significant control over our management.
As
of December 31, 2022, our directors and executive officers currently own an aggregate 24,431,826 shares of our common stock, which
currently constitutes 67.9% of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, directors and executive officers may have a significant
influence on our affairs and management, as well as on all matters requiring member approval, including electing and removing members
of our board of directors, causing us to engage in transactions with affiliated entities, causing or restricting our sale or merger,
and certain other matters. Our Chairman, Mr. Terren Peizer, may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Acuitas. Such concentration
of ownership and control could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us even when such a change
of control would be in the best interests of our stockholders.

There
is a limited trading market for our common stock, which could make it difficult to liquidate an investment in our common stock, in a
timely manner.
Our
common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Because there is a limited public market for our common stock, investors
may not be able to liquidate their investment whenever desired. We cannot assure that there will be an active trading market for our
common stock and the lack of an active public trading market could mean that investors may be exposed to increased risk. In addition,
if we failed to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker dealers who sell
our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers
from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect its liquidity.
We
may, in the future, issue additional common stock, which would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share
value.
As
of December 31, 2022 our Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of 800,000,000 shares of common stock, and we
had 34,504,332 shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly, we may issue up to an additional 753,719,062 shares of common
stock. The future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then
existing stockholders. We may value any common stock in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services
or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, might have
an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital in the future through the
sale of equity securities.
