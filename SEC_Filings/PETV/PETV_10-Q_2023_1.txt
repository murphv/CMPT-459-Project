SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION
(A)
Organization and Description
The
Company is in the business of licensing and commercializing our proprietary medical devices and biomaterials for the treatment and/or
management of afflictions and diseases in animals, initially for dogs and horses. The Company began commercialization of its lead product
Spryng™ with OsteoCushion™ Technology, a veterinarian-administered, intraarticular injection for the management of lameness
and other joint afflictions such osteoarthritis in dogs and horses, in September 2021. The Company has a pipeline of additional products
for the treatment of animals in various stages of development. A portfolio of nineteen patents protects the Company’s biomaterials,
products, production processes and methods of use. The Company’s operations are conducted from its headquarter facilities in suburban
Minneapolis, Minnesota.
(B)
Basis of Presentation
PetVivo
Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada under a former name in 2009 and entered its current business in
2014 through a stock exchange reverse merger with PetVivo, Inc., a Minnesota corporation. This merger resulted in Minnesota PetVivo becoming
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In April 2017, the Company acquired another Minnesota corporation, Gel-Del Technologies, Inc.,
through a statutory merger, which is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (including those which are normal and recurring) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
financial information have been included. The results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative
of results to be expected for the year ending March 31, 2023, or for any other interim period or for any future year. These unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022.
(C)
Principles of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its two wholly-owned Minnesota corporations, Gel-Del
Technologies, Inc. and PetVivo, Inc. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.
(D)
Use of Estimates
In
preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates include collectability of accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, estimated useful lives and potential impairment
of property and equipment and intangibles, estimate of fair value of share-based payments, distributor rebate payable, provision for
product returns, lease assets and liabilities and valuation of deferred tax assets.
(E)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly-liquid, temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
5
(F)
Concentration Risk
The
Company maintains its cash with various financial institutions, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. As of December 31,
2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company did have cash balances in excess of the federally insured limits.
(G)
Accounts Receivable
Accounts
receivable consists of amounts due from a distributor (see revenue recognition). Accounts receivable are recorded based on management’s
assessment of the expected consideration to be received, based on a detailed review of historical collections. Management relies on the
results of the assessment, which includes payment history of the applicable payer as a primary source of information in estimating the
collectability of our accounts receivable. We update our assessment on a quarterly basis, which to date has not resulted in any material
adjustments to the valuation of our accounts receivable. We believe the assessment provides reasonable estimates of our accounts receivable
valuation, and therefore we believe that substantially all accounts receivable are fully collectible.
(H)
Inventory
Inventories
are recorded in accordance with ASC 330, Inventory, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We account for inventories
using the first in first out (FIFO) methodology.
(I)
Property & Equipment
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method (after considering their respective estimated residual
values) over the assets estimated useful life of
3
to
5
years for production and computer equipment and furniture and
5
to
7
years for
leasehold improvements.
(J)
Patents and Trademarks
The
Company capitalizes direct costs for the maintenance and advancement of their patents and trademarks and amortizes these costs over the
lesser of the useful life of 60 months or the life of the patent. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by
considering events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.
(K)
Loss Per Share
Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents
and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period.
The
Company had
3,634,817
warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2022, with varying exercise prices ranging from $ 1.20
to $ 5.63
per share.
The weighted average exercise price for these warrants is $ 5.04
per share. These warrants are excluded from the weighted average number
of shares because they are considered anti-dilutive.
The
Company had
328,168
restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2022 which are excluded from the weighted average number of
shares because they are considered anti-dilutive.
The
Company had
755,849
options outstanding as of December 31, 2022, with varying exercise prices ranging from $ 1.39
to $ 2.79
per share.
The weighted average exercise price for these options is $ 2.17
per share. These options are excluded from the weighted average number
of shares because they are considered anti-dilutive.
The
Company had
3,754,484
warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2021, with varying exercise prices ranging from $ 1.20
to $ 6.67
per share.
The weighted average exercise price for these warrants is $ 4.95
per share. These warrants were excluded from the weighted average number
of shares because they are considered anti-dilutive.
6
The
Company had
549,265
restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2021 which were excluded from the weighted average number of
shares because they are considered anti-dilutive.
The
Company uses the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260 to determine if-converted loss per share. ASC
260 states that convertible securities should be considered exercised on the latter of the first day of the reporting period’s
quarter or the inception date of the debt instrument. Also, the if-converted method shall not be applied for the purposes of computing
diluted EPS if the effect would be anti-dilutive.
(L)
Revenue Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”
The
Company derives revenue from the sale of its pet care products directly to its veterinarian customers in the United States. The Company
recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the veterinarian customer are satisfied. Product sales
occur once control or title is transferred based on the commercial terms. Revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer, which
is when control of these products is transferred and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive for
these products. Shipping costs charged to customers are reported as an offset to the respective shipping costs. The Company does not
have any significant financing components as payment is received at or shortly after the point of sale.
The
Company entered into a Distribution Services Agreement (the “Agreement”) with MWI Veterinary Supply Co. (the “Distributor”)
on June 17, 2022. Contracts with the Distributor are evidenced by individual executed purchase orders subject to the terms of the Agreement.
The contracts consist of a single performance obligation related to the sale of our pet care products. Product sales occur once control
or title is transferred based on the commercial terms in the Agreement. Revenue is recognized upon delivery to the Distributor; payment
is due within 60 days. The Agreement provides for a distribution fee payable to the Distributor equal to
5 % of gross monthly sales payable
in 45 days; the distribution fee is netted against revenue. The Agreement provides for a rebate payable to the Distributor based on annual
sales volume that is retroactively applied. The rebate is estimated under the expected value method and is netted against revenue. Sales
are subject to various right of return provisions; the Company uses an expected value method to estimate returns and has determined that
any returns would be immaterial as of December 31, 2022. As a result, there is no refund liability recorded. Shipping and handling costs
are a fulfillment activity and are reported as cost of sales.
For
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized revenue from product sales under the Agreement of $ 456,502
and $ 574,766 , respectively. This represents
89 % and
73 % of total revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
Assets
and liabilities (included in accrued expenses) under the Agreement were as follows at December 31, 2022:

(N)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company applies the accounting guidance under FASB ASC 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements”, as well as certain related FASB
staff positions. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets
and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would
transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent
risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.
7
The
guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows:
●
Level
1 - quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level
2 - inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar
assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
●
Level
3 - unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.
The
Company’s financial instruments consist of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and note payable and accrued
interest. The carrying amount of the Company’s financial instruments approximates their fair value as of December 31, 2022 and
March 31, 2022, due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the Company’s borrowing rate of interest.
In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The valuation
of the Company’s note recorded at fair value is determined using Level 3 inputs, which consider (i) time value, (ii) current market
and (iii) contractual prices.
The
Company had
no
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
(O)
Stock-Based Compensation - Non-Employees
Equity
Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services
The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under the guidance of
Sub-topic 505-50 of the FASB ASC (“Sub-topic 505-50”).
Pursuant
to ASC Section 505-50-30, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments
are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable. The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of
the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.
The
fair value of share options and similar instruments is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation
model. The ranges of assumptions for inputs are as follows:
●
Expected
term of share options and similar instruments: Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB ASC the expected term of share
options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding
taking into consideration the contractual term of the instruments and the holder’s expected exercise behavior into the fair
value (or calculated value) of the instruments. The Company uses historical data to estimate the holder’s expected exercise
behavior.
●
Expected
volatility of the entity’s shares and the method used to estimate it. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(ii) a thinly
traded or nonpublic entity that uses the calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company
to estimate the expected volatility of its share price, the appropriate industry sector index that it has selected, the reasons for
selecting that particular index, and how it has calculated historical volatility using that index. The Company uses the average historical
volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options or similar instruments as its expected
volatility.
8
●
Expected
annual rate of quarterly dividends. An entity that uses a method that employs different dividend rates during the contractual term
shall disclose the range of expected dividends used and the weighted-average expected dividends. The expected dividend yield is based
on the Company’s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected term
of the share options and similar instruments.
●
Risk-free
rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose the range of risk-free rates used. The
risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the expected
term of the share options and similar instruments.
Pursuant
to Paragraphs 505-50-25-8 and 505-50-25-9, an entity may grant fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable
by the grantee only after a specified period of time or if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee
achieves specified performance conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the
same manner as if the entity had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of paying with,
or using, the equity instruments. A recognized asset, expense, or sales discount shall not be reversed if a share option and similar
instrument that the counterparty has the right to exercise expires unexercised.
(P)
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock
options are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes valuation model require the input of highly subjective
assumptions. The assumptions include the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, expected
dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the significant application of management’s
judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in
the future. We recognize compensation expense for these options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (see Note
11 – “Stockholders’ Equity”).
(Q)
Income Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
As
required by ASC Topic 450, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant
tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not
threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
The
Company is not currently under examination by any federal or state jurisdiction.
The
Company’s policy is to record tax-related interest and penalties as a component of operating expenses.
(R)
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company has reviewed the FASB issued ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the
periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted
accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company’s reported
financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of the Company’s
financial management.
9
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts on an Entity’s
Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP.
Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded
conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative
scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exceptions. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income
per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim
periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
the standard on the consolidated financial statements.
All
other newly issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
The
Company incurred net losses of $ 6,388,635
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, had net cash used in operating activities of $ 5,500,247
for the same period and has an accumulated deficit of $ 69,515,056
at December 31, 2022. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months after the date of issuance of these
financial statements. In view of these matters, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s
ability to achieve a level of profitability and/or to obtain adequate financing through the issuance of debt or equity in order to finance
its operations.
The
Company sold shares of its common stock in January 2023 (see Note 12) and management intends to raise additional funds through the offering
of its equity securities. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan will enable
the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances
to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement
its business plan and raise additional funds.
COVID-19
has had an impact on the global economy, which directly or indirectly may have an impact on our ability to continue as a going concern.
These
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Equity
Incentive Plan
On
July 10, 2020, our Board of Directors unanimously approved the PetVivo Holdings, Inc “2020 Equity Incentive Plan” (the “2020
Plan”), which authorized the issuance of up to
1,000,000
shares of our common stock as awards under the 2020 Plan, subject to approval
by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on September 22, 2020, when it was approved by our stockholders and became
effective. On October 14, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved the PetVivo Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2020 Equity
Incentive Plan (the “Amended Plan”), which increased the number of shares of the Company’s common stock which may be
granted under the Amended Plan from
1,000,000
to
3,000,000 . Unless sooner terminated by the Board, the Amended Plan will terminate at
midnight on
July 10, 2030 . The number of shares available to grant under the Amended Plan was
1,673,074
at December 31, 2022.
Employees,
consultants, and advisors of the Company (or any subsidiary), and non-employee directors of the Company will be eligible to receive awards
under the Amended Plan. In the case of consultants and advisors, however, their services cannot be in connection with the offer and sale
of securities in a capital-raising transaction nor directly or indirectly to promote or maintain a market for PetVivo common stock.
The
Amended Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Committee”), which has full power
and authority to determine when and to whom awards will be granted, and the type, amount, form of payment, any deferral payment, and
other terms and conditions of each award. Subject to provisions of the Amended Plan, the Committee may amend or waive the terms and conditions,
or accelerate the exercisability, of an outstanding award. The Committee also has the authority to interpret and establish rules and
regulations for the administration of the Amended Plan. In addition, the Board of Directors may also exercise the powers of the Committee.
13
The
aggregate number of shares of PetVivo common stock available and reserved to be issued under the Amended Plan is
3,000,000
shares, but
includes the following limits:
●
the
maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock granted as an Award to any Non-Employee Director in any one Plan Year will be
10,000
shares; provided that such limit will not apply to any election of a Non-Employee Director to receive shares of Common Stock
in lieu of all or a portion of any annual Board, committee chair or other retainer, or any meeting fees otherwise payable in cash.
Awards
can be granted for no cash consideration or for any cash and other consideration as determined by the Committee. Awards may provide that
upon the grant or exercise thereof, the holder will receive cash, shares of PetVivo common stock, other securities or property, or any
combination of these in a single payment, installments or on a deferred basis. The exercise price per share of any stock option and the
grant price of any stock appreciation right may not be less than the fair market value of PetVivo common stock on the date of grant.
The term of any award cannot be longer than ten years from the date of grant. Awards will be adjusted in the event of a stock dividend
or other distribution, recapitalization, forward or reverse stock split, reorganization, merger or other business combination, or similar

The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Annually, we make predictive
assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, dividend yield, expected term and forfeiture rate. The dividend yield assumption
is based on expected annual dividend yield on a grant date. To date, no dividends on common stock have been paid by us. Expected volatility
for grants is based on our average historical volatility over a similar period as the expected term assumption used for our options as
the expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected
term of the options for each option group. We use the “simplified method” to determine the expected term of the stock option
grants. We utilize this method because we do not have sufficient public company exercise data in which to make a reasonable estimate.
The
following table sets forth the assumptions used to estimate fair values of our stock options granted:

3,043,556
shares of common stock in
connection with its public offering of units, as follow:
●
warrants
to purchase
2,500,000
shares of the Company’s common stock with a relative value of $ 4,805,528 , at an exercise price of $ 5.625
per share for
five years
from the grant date of August 10, 2021 issued to investors in the Public Offering as part of the units,
●
warrants
to purchase
43,556
shares of the Company’s common stock, pursuant to a conversion of $ 196,000
share-settled debt obligation
in the Public Offering, with a relative value of $ 83,724 , at an exercise price of $ 5.625
per share for
five years
from the grant
date of August 10, 2021 to the Company’s former Director of Science and Technology and Director pursuant to a note conversion
in the Public Offering as part of the units,
●
warrants
to purchase
500,000

per share for
five years
from the grant
date of August 10, 2021 issued to ThinkEquity upon exercise of its over-allotment option and pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.
These warrants were considered issuance costs of the Public Offering which resulted in a zero impact on additional paid-in capital.
These
warrants’ values were arrived at by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
i)
an expected volatility of the Company’s shares on the date of the grant of approximately
315 % based on historical volatility.
ii)
risk-free rate identical to the U.S. Treasury
5 -year treasury bill rate on the date of the grant of
0.82 %.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
GENERAL
PetVivo
Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “PetVivo,” “we” or “us) is an emerging biomedical device company
focused on the manufacturing, commercialization and licensing of innovative medical devices and therapeutics for animals. The Company
began commercialization of its lead product Spryng™ with OsteoCushion™ Technology, a veterinarian-administered, intra-articular
injection for the management of lameness and other joint afflictions such as osteoarthritis in dogs and horses, in September 2021. The
Company has a pipeline of additional products for the treatment of animals in various stages of development. A portfolio of nineteen
patents protects the Company’s biomaterials, products, production processes and methods of use.
In
August 2021, we received net proceeds of approximately $9.8 million in a registered public offering (“Public Offering”) of
2.5 million units at a public offering price of $4.50 per unit. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant
to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.625 per share. The shares of common stock and warrants were transferable
separately immediately upon issuance. In connection with the Public Offering, the Company’s common stock and warrants were registered
under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, LLC under the symbols “PETV” and
“PETVW,” respectively.
The
Company was incorporated in March 2009 under Nevada law under a different name. The Company operates as one segment from its corporate
headquarters in Edina, Minnesota.
CURRENT
BUSINESS OPERATIONS
The
Company is primarily engaged in the business of commercializing and licensing products in the veterinary market to treat and/or manage
afflictions of companion animals such as dogs and horses. The Company’s lead product, Spryng™, is based on proprietary technology
developed for human biomedical applications, and we intend to leverage the investments already expended in this development to commercialize
treatments for companion animals in a capital and time-efficient way.
The
Company’s lead product, Spryng™ is derived from proprietary biomaterials that simulate a body’s cellular or acellular
tissue by virtue of their reliance upon natural protein and carbohydrate compositions which incorporate such “tissue building blocks”
as collagen, elastin and heparin. Since these are naturally-occurring in the body, we believe they have an enhanced biocompatibility
with living tissues compared to polymeric biomaterials such as those based upon alpha-hydroxy polymers (e.g. PLA, PLGA and the like),
polycryamides and other “synthetic” biomaterials that may lack the multiple “natural” proteins and carbohydrates
incorporated into our biomaterials. These proprietary protein-based biomaterials appear to mimic the body’s tissue thus allowing
integration and tissue repair in long-term implantation in certain applications.
The
Company’s lead product, Spryng™ is a veterinary medical device designed to help reinforce and augment articular cartilage
tissue for the management of lameness and other joint related afflictions, such as osteoarthritis, in companion animals. Spryng™
is an intra-articular injectable product of biocompatible and insoluble particles that are slippery, wet-permeable, durable, and resilient
to enhance the force cushioning function of the synovial fluid and cartilage. The particles are similar to natural cartilage in composition,
structure, and hydration. Multiple joints can be treated simultaneously. Our particles are comprised of collagen, elastin and heparin,
similar components found in natural cartilage. These particles show an effectiveness to reinforce and augment the cartilage, which enhances
the functionality of the joint (e.g. provide cushion or shock-absorbing features to the joint and to provide joint lubricity).
Osteoarthritis,
a common inflammatory joint disease in both dogs and horses, is a chronic, progressive, degenerative joint disease that is caused by
a loss of synovial fluid and/or the deterioration of joint cartilage. Osteoarthritis affects approximately 14 million dogs and 1 million
horses in the $11 billion companion animal veterinary care and product sales market.
19
Despite
the market size, veterinary clinics and hospitals have very few treatments and/or drugs for use in treating osteoarthritis in dogs, horses
and other pets. As there is no cure for osteoarthritis, current solutions treat symptoms but do not manage the cause. The current treatment
for osteoarthritis in dogs generally consists of the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (or “NSAIDs”) which are
approved to alleviate pain and inflammation but present the potential for side effects relating to gastrointestinal, kidney and liver
damage and do not halt or slow joint degeneration. The Company offers an alternative to traditional treatments that only address the
symptoms of the affliction. Spryng™ with OsteoCushion™ Technology addresses the affliction, loss of synovial fluid and/or
the deterioration of joint cartilage, rather than treating just the symptoms and, to the best our knowledge, has elicited minimal adverse
side effects in dogs and horses. Based on information provided to us by veterinarians and pet owners, Spryng™-treated dogs and
horses have shown an increase in activity even after they no longer are receiving pain medication or other treatments. Other treatments
for osteoarthritis include steroid and/or hyaluronic acid injections, which are used for treating pain and inflammation and/or enhancing
joint lubrication, but can be slow acting and/or short lasting.
We
believe Spryng™ is an optimal solution to safely improve joint function in animals for several reasons:
●
Spryng™
addresses the underlying problems which relate to deterioration of cartilage causing bones to contact each other and a lack of synovial
fluid. Spryng™ provides a biocompatible lubricious cushion to the joint, which establishes a barrier between the bones, thereby
protecting the remaining cartilage and bone.
●
Spryng™
is easily administered with the standard intra-articular injection technique. Multiple joints can be treated simultaneously.
●
Case
studies indicate many dogs and horses have long-lasting improvement in lameness
after
having been treated with Spryng™.
●
After
receiving a Spryng™ injection, many canines are able to discontinue the use of NSAID’s, eliminating
the
risk of negative side effects.
●
Spryng™
is an effective and economical solution for treating osteoarthritis. A single injection of Spryng™ is approximately $600 to
$900 per joint and typically lasts for at least 12 months.
Historically,
drug sales represent up to 30% of revenues at a typical veterinary practice (Veterinary Practice News). Revenues and margins at veterinary
practices are being eroded because online, big-box and traditional pharmacies have recently started filling veterinary prescriptions.
Veterinary practices are looking for ways to replace lost prescription revenues with safe and effective products. Spryng™ is a
veterinarian-administered medical device that will help veterinarians provide a new solution for treating dogs and horses which have
lameness due to synovial joint issues, while expanding revenues and margins for their practices.
Spryng™
is classified as a veterinary medical device under the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) rules and pre-market
approval is not required by the FDA. Spryng™ completed a safety and efficacy study in rabbits in 2007. Since that time, more than
1,500 horses and dogs have been treated with Spryng™. We entered into a clinical trial services agreement with Colorado State University
on November 5, 2020. We expect this university clinical study to be completed in March 2024. Additionally, the Company successfully completed
an equine tolerance study in March 2022 and began a canine clinical study with Ethos Veterinary Health in May 2022 with anticipated completion
in fiscal 2023. We anticipate these and other studies that we plan to initiate will be primarily used to support our commercialization
efforts and expand the use of Spryng™ in other applications.
We
commenced sales of Spryng™ in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and plan to increase our commercialization efforts of Spryng™
in the United States through our distribution relationship with MWI Veterinary Supply Co. (“Distributor” or “MWI”)
and the use of sales reps, clinical studies and market awareness to educate and inform key opinion leaders on the benefits of Spryng™.
We
entered into a Distribution Services Agreement (“Distribution Agreement”) with MWI on June 17, 2022. Pursuant to the Agreement,
we appointed MWI to distribute, advertise, promote, market, supply and sell the Company’s lead product, Spryng™ on an exclusive
basis for two (2) years within the United States (the “Territory”), transitioning to a non-exclusive basis thereafter; provided
however that the Company shall extend the exclusivity for an additional one (1) year if MWI achieves certain performance targets agreed
upon by the parties. The Company can continue to sell Spryng™ within the Territory to established accounts, which include: (a)
customers who have purchased Spryng™ from the Company prior to the date of the Agreement, (b) customers who require that they deal
directly with the Company, (c) governmental agencies, and (d) customers that order via the internet who are not directly solicited by
MWI to purchase Spryng™. All customers must be licensed veterinary practices.
20
We
manufacture our products in our ISO 7 certified clean room facility in Minneapolis using our patented and scalable self-assembly production
process, which minimizes the infrastructure requirements and manufacturing risks to deliver a consistent, high-quality product while
being responsive to volume requirements. A second ISO 7 cleanroom facility is expected to be operational later this year. We believe
that having two manufacturing facilities will help us minimize supply risks, allow for the continued scaling of our production capacity,
and expand our research and development facilities.
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our 2022 10-K Report and the consolidated financial statements and related notes
in Item 1, Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“10-Q Report”).
The
following discussion may contain forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ materially from the results suggested
by these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part
I, Item 1A of our 2022 10-K Report under the heading “Risk Factors,” as updated and supplemented by risks described in other
SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required
by law.
We
are a smaller reporting company and have not generated material revenues to date and have incurred substantial losses in connection with
our limited operations. We need substantial capital to pursue our current plans to commercialize our initial product, Spryng™.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
On
August 13, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 2,500,000 units, at a price of $4.50 per unit. Net proceeds from the Public
Offering were approximately $9,781,000, net of commissions and expenses of the offering.
As
of December 31, 2022, our current assets were $1,735,929, including $374,533 in cash and cash equivalents. In comparison, our current
liabilities as of that date were $1,564,582 including $1,497,680 of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital as of
December 31, 2022 was $171,347.
The
Company has continued to realize losses from operations. However, as a result of our Public Offering and the recent sale of our common
stock in a registered direct offering which closed in January 2023, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating
costs and capital expenditure requirements for the next four months. We will need to raise additional capital in the future to support
our efforts to commercialize Spryng™ and our ongoing operations. We expect to continue to raise additional capital through the
sale of our securities from time to time for the foreseeable future to fund our business expansion. Our ability to obtain such additional
capital will likely be subject to various factors, including our overall business performance and market conditions. There can be no
guarantee that the Company will be successful in its ability to raise additional capital to fund its business plan.
Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities
– We used $5,500,247 of net cash in operating activities for the nine months ended December
31, 2022. This cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to our net loss of $6,388,635, an increase in inventories
of $276,569, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $140,930 and an increase in accounts receivable of $504,248, partially
offset by stock compensation expense of $1,069,585 and stock issued for services of $258,844.
23
Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities
– We used $293,851 of net cash in investing activities for the nine months ended December
31, 2022, consisting of costs capitalized for manufacturing and computer equipment.
Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
– Cash provided from financing activities was $61,804 for the nine months ended December
31, 2022 consisting of cash received of $66,558 from the exercise of warrants partially offset by $4,754 in repayments of a note payable.
Inventory
Inventories
are stated at cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead
related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand through an inventory count.
At
December 31, 2022, the Company’s inventory has a carrying value of $374,882 and is broken down into $30,947 of finished goods,
$25,860 of work in process and $318,075 in raw materials.
At
March 31, 2022, the Company’s inventory had a carrying value of $98,313 and was broken down into $11,889 of finished goods, $22,960
of work in process and $63,464 in raw materials.
MATERIAL
COMMITMENTS
Note
Payable
As
of December 31, 2022, we are obligated on a note and accrued interest of $28,996.
Purchase
Commitment
We
issued purchase orders as of December 31, 2022 totaling $51,000 for inventory that we expect to receive within the next three months.
OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As
of December 31, 2022, and as of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
GOING
CONCERN
The
independent auditors’ report accompanying our 2022 10-K Report and financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will
continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary
course of business. In August 2021, we raised approximately $9,781,000 from the sale of units in a Public Offering. Our working capital
at December 31, 2022 was $171,347. In January 2023, the Company sold 610,011 shares of its common stock in a registered direct offering
at a purchase price of $2.32 per share. Proceeds from this offering were approximately $1.4 million, after deducting transaction expenses.
We believe this working capital is sufficient to fund operations for the next four months (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”
above).
We
have continued to realize losses from operations. However, as a result of our Public Offering and the recent sale of our common stock
in a registered direct offering, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next four months. We will need to raise additional capital in the future to support our efforts to commercialize
Spryng™ and our ongoing operations. We expect to continue to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities from time
to time for the foreseeable future to fund our business expansion. Our ability to obtain such additional capital will likely be subject
to various factors, including our overall business performance and market conditions. There can be no guarantee that the Company will
be successful in its ability to raise additional capital to fund its business plan.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the United States of America.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. We believe these
accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The
Company has reviewed the FASB-issued ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the
periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted
accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company’s reported
financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of the Company’s
financial management.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts on an Entity’s
Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP.
Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded
conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative
scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exceptions. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income
per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim
periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
the standard on the consolidated financial statements.
All
other newly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 11,250 shares of common stock in December related to vesting of restricted
stock units issued to three employees.
All
of these transactions described above were exempt from registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. The purchasers of securities in each of these transactions represented
their intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to offer or sell, in connection with any distribution
of the securities, and appropriate legends were affixed to the share certificates and instruments issued in such transactions.
Use
of Proceeds from IPO
On
August 13, 2021, we completed our Public Offering pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,500,000 units at the public
offering price of $4.50 per unit. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common
stock at an exercise price of $5.625 per share. The shares of common stock and warrants were transferable separately immediately upon
issuance. At the closing of the Public Offering, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 375,000
warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $3,850.
The
offer and sale of all of the units in our Public Offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement
on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-249452), which was declared effective by the SEC on August 10, 2021 (“Registration Statement”).
ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc. acted as the sole book-running manager for the offering. In connection
with the Public Offering, the Company’s common stock and warrants were registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and began
trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, LLC under the symbols “PETV” and “PETVW,” respectively.
We
received aggregate gross proceeds from our Public Offering of $11,253,850 (inclusive of the underwriter’s exercise of its overallotment
option to purchase warrants). After deducing underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds
of approximately $9,781,000 from the Public Offering.
As
disclosed in the Registration Statement, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the Public Offering for debt repayment of $101,400
consisting of (i) $36,808 in accrued salary and expenses relating to the CEO; (ii) $20,000 in notes payable to four directors, which
accrued interest at a rate of 6.5% per annum and matured in September 2021; and (iii) repayment of $44,554 in a note payable to our former
Director of Science and Technology and a director, which accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum, and maturity date of June 30, 2022.
There
has been no material change in our intended use of proceeds from our Public Offering as described in the Prospectus filed with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on August 13, 2021.
