ENOCHIAN BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 —
THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business
–  Enochian
Biosciences Inc., (“Enochian,” or “Registrant”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”,
“we” or “us”) engages in the research and development of pharmaceutical and biological products for the treatment
of Cancer, HIV, and HBV with the intent to manufacture said products.
Going Concern
-
These financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenue, has incurred substantial recurring losses
from continuing operations and has an accumulated deficit of $ 216,502,705
as of December 31, 2022. The continuation of the Company as
a going concern is dependent upon (i) its ability to successfully obtain FDA approval of its product candidates, (ii) its ability to
obtain any necessary debt and/or equity financing, and (iii) its ability to generate profits from the Company’s future operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from
the issuance of these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.
Basis of Presentation
–
The Company prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and follows the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The accompanying financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at December 31, 2022, and 2021
and for the periods then ended have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s June 30, 2022, audited
financial statements. The results of operations for the periods ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results for the full year.
Consolidation
– For
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and
operations of the Registrant and its subsidiaries. All material inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.
Reclassification
–
Certain
amounts in the prior period financial statements, have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. For the three and six
months ended December 31, 2021, we reclassified lab expenses of $ 193,137
and $ 242,330 , respectively from general and administrative expenses
to research and development expenses .
Accounting Estimates
–
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimated. Significant estimates include the fair value and potential impairment of intangible assets, and fair value of equity
instruments issued.
COVID-19 Update
– The COVID-19 pandemic
continues to evolve. COVID-19 may cause delays in our research activities. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially
affected our operations. However, it has caused delays in the conduct of experiments due to limitations in resources and supply
chain issues, in particular for those third-parties conducting experiments. There have also been increases in the cost to conduct
animal studies due to staffing and other limitations.
The full extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic may impact our business and operations is subject to future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict. We continue
to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations and will seek to adjust our activities as appropriate.
In addition, the pandemic could
result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the
future negatively affect the financial resources available to us.
Functional Currency & Foreign
Currency Translation
– The functional currency of Enochian Denmark is the Danish Kroner (“DKK”). The Company’s
reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar for the purpose of these financial statements. The Company’s balance sheet accounts are translated
into U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rates and all revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange
rates prevailing during the periods ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. Translation gains and losses are deferred and accumulated as a
component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations
from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the statement of operations as incurred.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(Continued)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
–
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company had balances held in financial institutions in Denmark and in the United States in excess of federally insured amounts at December
31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, of $ 3,830,530
and $ 8,805,495 , respectively.
Property and Equipment
–
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and
equipment are capitalized and depreciated upon being placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which range from four to ten years (see Note 4.)
Intangible Assets
–
The
Company has both definite and indefinite life intangible assets.
Definite life intangible assets
include patents. The Company accounts for definite life intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. Intangible assets
are recorded at cost. Patent costs consist of costs incurred to acquire the underlying patent. If it is determined that a patent will
not be issued, the related remaining capitalized patent costs are charged to expense. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of patents is twenty years from the date of application.
Indefinite life intangible assets
include license agreements and goodwill. The Company accounts for indefinite life intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets”. License agreement costs represent the fair value of the license agreement on the date acquired and
are tested annually for impairment, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill
– Goodwill
is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of June 30 th
of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of Goodwill and
Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets
– We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below
the operating segment level. Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting
unit and is based on discounted cash flows or relative market-based approaches. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its
fair value, we record an impairment loss for such excess. The annual fair value analysis performed on goodwill supported that goodwill
was not impaired as of June 30, 2022, and no impairment is deemed necessary as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 5.)
For indefinite-lived intangible
assets, such as licenses acquired as an IPR&D asset, on an annual basis we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment
loss, if any, for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the carrying value
of the licenses acquired as an IPR&D asset exceeded its fair value. Therefore, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $ 93,253,000
during the year ended June 30, 2022. No additional impairment is deemed necessary as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 5.)
The carrying value of IPR&D
and goodwill at December 31, 2022, was $ 61,571,000
and $ 11,640,000 , respectively.

NOTE 1 — THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(Continued)
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
–
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, definite and indefinite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Circumstances which
could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes
in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast
of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold
or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.
Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge
is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of
would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell
and would no longer be depreciated. The depreciable basis of assets that are impaired and continue in use are their respective fair values.
Leases
– In accordance
with ASC Topic 842, the Company determined the initial classification and measurement of its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
at the lease commencement date and thereafter. The lease terms include any renewal options and termination options that the Company is
reasonably assured to exercise, if applicable. The present value of lease payments is determined by using the implicit interest rate
in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise, the Company develops an incremental borrowing rate based on the information
available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the future payments.
Rent expense for operating leases
is recognized on a straight-line basis, unless the operating lease right of use assets have been impaired, over the reasonably assured
lease term based on the total lease payments and is included in operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
For operating leases that reflect impairment, the Company will recognize the amortization of the operating lease right-of-use assets
on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term with rent expense still included in general and administrative expenses in the
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
The Company has elected the practical
expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. The Company’s non-lease components are primarily related to property
maintenance, insurance, and taxes, which vary based on future outcomes, and thus are recognized in general and administrative expenses
when incurred (see Note 6.)
Research and Development Expenses
– The Company expenses research and development costs incurred in formulating, improving, validating, and creating alternative
or modified processes related to and expanding the use of the Oncology, HIV and HBV therapies and technologies for use in the prevention,
treatment, amelioration of and/or therapy for Oncology, HIV and HBV. Research and development expenses for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022, amounted to $ 325,959
and $ 2,931,334 , respectively. Research and development expenses for the three and six months
ended December 31, 2021, amounted to $ 2,337,222 , and $ 5,392,658 , respectively.
Income Taxes
– The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”, which requires an
asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes.
Loss Per Share
–
The Company calculates earnings/ (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share”. Basic earnings
per common share (EPS) are based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings
per common share are based on shares outstanding (computed as under basic EPS) and potentially dilutive shares of Common Stock. Potential
shares of Common Stock included in the diluted earnings per share calculation include in-the-money stock options that have been granted
but have not been exercised. Because of the net loss for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the dilutive shares
for both periods were excluded from the Diluted EPS calculation as the effect of these potential shares of Common Stock is anti-dilutive.
The Company had
4,833,436
and
7,125,894
potential shares of Common Stock excluded from the Diluted EPS calculation as of December 31,
2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
– The Company accounts for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC
Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements”. The authoritative guidance, among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either
a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to
sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability (see Note
3.)
Stock Options and Restricted
Share Units
– The Company has granted stock options, restricted share units (“RSUs”) and warrants. The Company
accounts for stock-based awards in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation”.
Stock-Based Compensation
– The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation”.
All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted
for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more
reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to consultants and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and
recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the required service period, which is
generally the vesting period. Stock based compensation costs for the vesting of options and RSUs granted for the three and six months
ended December 31, 2022, were $ 819,955
and $ 1,845,963 , respectively. Stock-based compensation costs for the vesting of the options and
RSUs granted for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, were $ 2,043,292

GOING CONCERN
The Company’s consolidated
financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has incurred substantial
recurring losses from continuing operations, has used cash in the Company’s continuing operations, and is dependent on additional
financing to fund operations. The Company incurred a net loss of approximately $ 4,457,748
and $ 12,157,508
for the three and six months
ended December 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 4,118,896
and an accumulated
deficit of $ 216,502,705 . These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for
one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue in existence. Management intends to raise additional funds for (a) research and development,
(b) increases in personnel, and (c) the purchase of equipment, specifically to advance the Company’s potential products through
the regulatory process. The Company may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or debt securities.
Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely
affect the Company’s growth plans and its financial condition and results of operations.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company accounts for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC
Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements”. The authoritative guidance among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either

sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a
basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used
in measuring fair value as follows:
●
Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities;
●
Level 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are
observable either directly or indirectly; and
●
Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market
data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
There were no Level 1, 2 or 3
assets, nor any Level 1, 2 or 3 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022.

During February 2018, the Company

and sole and exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, use, sell, have sold, make, have made, offer for sale, import and otherwise
commercialize certain intellectual property in cellular therapies for the prevention, treatment, amelioration of and/or therapy exclusively
for HIV in humans, and research and development exclusively relating to HIV in humans. Because the HIV License Agreement is considered
an IPR&D intangible asset it is classified as an indefinite life asset that is tested annually for impairment.
Impairment – Following the
fourth quarter of each year, management performs its annual test of impairment of intangible assets by performing a quantitative assessment
and determines if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is greater than or equal to the carrying value of the asset.
The results of the quantitative assessment indicated that the carrying value of the licenses acquired as an IPR&D asset exceeded
its fair value, due to the sublicensing of ENOB HV-01, which required a different valuation approach and changes in other factors impacting
the fair value of the asset. Therefore, an impairment adjustment of $ 93,253,000
was recorded in the year ended June 30, 2022.
No
additional
impairment is deemed necessary as of December 31, 2022.

Operating
Leases

On November 13, 2017, the Company entered into a Lease Agreement for a term of five years and two months from November
1, 2017, with Plaza Medical Office Building, LLC, a California limited liability company, as landlord, (the “Landlord”),
pursuant to which the Company agreed to lease from the Landlord approximately 2,325 rentable square feet. The base rent increased by
3% each year, and ranged from approximately $8,719 per month for the first year to $10,107 per month for the two months of the sixth
year. The lease was terminated early without penalties or additional costs as of September 30, 2022,
that released an accrual of $ 70,800
related to leasehold improvements that was not utilized.
On June 19, 2018, the Company
entered into a Lease Agreement for a term of ten years from September 1, 2018, with Century City Medical Plaza Land Co., Inc., pursuant
to which the Company agreed to lease approximately 2,453 rentable square feet. On February 20, 2019, the Company entered into an Addendum
to the original Lease Agreement with an effective date of December 1, 2019, where it expanded the lease area to include another 1,101
square feet for a total rentable 3,554 square feet. The base rent increases by 3% each year, and ranges from $17,770 per month for the
first year to $23,186 per month for the tenth year. The equalized monthly lease expense for the term of the lease is $20,050.
The Company
subleased the space as of June 25, 2022 (see subsection below “ Sublease Agreement ” for details.)
The Company identified and assessed
the following significant assumptions in recognizing the right-of-use asset and corresponding liabilities:
Expected lease term
— The expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and, when applicable, cancelable option periods when it is reasonably
certain that the Company would exercise such options. The Company’s lease has a remaining lease term of 56 months. As of December
31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining term is
4.67
years.
Incremental borrowing rate
— The Company’s lease agreements do not provide an implicit rate. As the Company does not have any external borrowings
for comparable terms of its leases, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve rate
that corresponds to the length of each lease. This rate is an estimate of what the Company would have to pay if borrowing on a collateralized
basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted-average
discount rate is
4.03 %.
Lease and non-lease components
— In certain cases the Company is required to pay for certain additional charges for operating costs, including insurance,
maintenance, taxes, and other costs incurred, which are billed based on both usage and as a percentage of the Company’s share of
total square footage. The Company determined that these costs are non-lease components, and they are not included in the calculation
of the lease liabilities because they are variable. Payments for these variable, non-lease components are considered variable lease costs
and are recognized in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Below are the lease commitments

Sublease Agreement
On June 20, 2022, the Company
entered into a sublease Agreement with One Health Labs (the “Subtenant”), whereby the Subtenant agreed to lease 3,554 square
feet of space currently rented by the Company in Century City Medical Plaza as of June 25, 2022, for a period of 3.5 years with an option
to renew for the remaining term of the lease that ends as of June 19, 2028. The base rent is $17,770 per month plus $750 towards utility
fees that are part of the original lease agreement and will increase by 3% each year over the term of the sub-lease. The Company received
a total of $57,022 on July 1, 2022 after execution of the sublease to cover the first month rent, utility fee and deposit. The first
sublease payment began on August 1, 2022.
In accordance with ASC Topic 842,
the Company treats the sublease as a separate lease, as the Company was not relieved of the primary obligation under the original lease.
The Company continues to account for the Century City Medical Plaza lease as a lessee and in the same manner as prior to the commencement
date of the sublease. The Company accounts for the sublease as a lessor of the lease. The sublease is classified as an operating lease,
as it does not meet the criteria of a sales-type or direct financing lease.
The Company will recognize operating
income from the sublease on a straight-line basis in its statements of operations over the sublease term.
During the three and six months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net operating lease expenses were as follows:

Convertible Notes Payable
—
On February 6, 2020, the Company issued two Convertible Notes (the “Convertible Notes”) to Paseco APS (the “Holder”),
a Danish limited company and an existing stockholder of the Company each with a face value amount of $ 600,000 , convertible into shares
of Common Stock, $ 0.0001
par value per share. The outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes was due and payable on
February
6, 2023 . Interest on the Convertible Notes commenced accruing on the date of issuance at six percent ( 6 %) per annum, computed on the
basis of twelve 30-day months, and is compounded monthly on the final day of each calendar month based upon the principal and all accrued
and unpaid interest outstanding as of such compound date. The interest was payable in cash on a semi-annual basis.
The holder of the Convertible
Notes had the right at any time prior to the date that is twelve months from issuance to convert all or any part of the outstanding and
unpaid principal and all unpaid interest into shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The conversion price was equal to $ 12.00
per
share of Common Stock. The Holder did not exercise the conversion feature that expired on February 6, 2021. The Company evaluated the
Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 470-20 and identified that they each contain an embedded conversion feature that shall not be
bifurcated from the host document (i.e., the Convertible Notes) as they are not deemed to be readily convertible into cash. All proceeds
received from the issuance have been recognized as a liability on the balance sheet. The Convertible Notes balance as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, was $ 1,200,000 .
Effective December 30, 2022
(the “Effective Date”), the Company amended and restated the Convertible Notes (the “Amended and Restated Secured
Notes”). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Secured Notes, the due date was extended to
February
28, 2024 , and the interest was increased to twelve percent ( 12 %)
per annum, which was prepaid by the Company in full on the date of amendment through the issuance of
198,439
shares of the Company’s Common Stock which is comprised of
29,419
shares for accrued interest up to the Effective Date and
169,020
shares related to the prepayment of interest through the extension date of the Amended and Restated Secured Notes using the closing
market price on that date, of $ 1.03 .
The obligations of the Company under the Amended and Restated Secured Notes were secured by a security agreement (the
“Security Agreement”). The Company evaluated the Secured Notes and conversion feature to determine
the appropriate accounting treatment based on the terms of the agreement.  In accordance with ASC 480-Distinguising Liabilities from
Equity, the Company determined that the Secured Notes embody an obligation that may require the Company to settle with the issuance of
a variable number of shares, where the monetary value of the obligation is based predominantly on a fixed monetary amount $ 1,200,000
known
at inception. Accordingly, the Company recorded the Secured Note as share settled debt. The total value of the shares issued were $ 204,392
which included $ 174,090
as prepaid interest and $ 30,302
for accrued interest as of December 30, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022 and
2021, the Company recorded accrued interest in the amount of zero
0
and $ 24,181 , which is included in accrued expenses. For the
three and six months ended December 31, 2022 the interest expense related to the Convertible Notes amounted to $ 18,272
and $ 36,453
respectively. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 the interest expense related to the Convertible Notes amounted to
$ 18,181
and $ 36,453
respectively.
Note Payable
— On
March 30, 2020 (the “Issuance Date”), the Company issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $ 5,000,000
(the “Promissory
Note”) to the Holder. The principal amount of the Promissory Note was originally payable on
November 30, 2021
(the “Maturity
Date”). The Promissory Note bore interest at a fixed rate of
6 % per annum, computed based on the number of days between the Issuance
Date and the Maturity Date, which was prepaid by the Company in full on the Issuance Date through the issuance of
188,485
shares of the
Company’s Common Stock based on the closing market price on that date for a total value of $ 501,370 . The Company evaluated the
Unsecured Note and PIK interest in accordance with ASC 470-Debt and ASC 835-Interest, respectively. Pursuant to ASC 470-20, proceeds
received from the issuance are to be recognized at their relative fair value, thus the liability is shown net of the corresponding discount
of $ 493,192 , which is the relative fair value of the shares issued for the PIK interest on the closing date using the effective interest
method. The discount of $ 493,192
will be accreted over the life of the Promissory Note.
On February 11, 2021, the Company
entered into an amendment to the Promissory Note that extended the Maturity Date to
November 30, 2022 . All other terms of the Promissory
Note remained the same. The change in Maturity Date required an additional year of interest at the fixed rate of
6 % per annum, which
was prepaid by the Company in full on the date of the amendment through the issuance of
74,054
shares of the Company’s Common Stock
based on the closing market price on that date for a total value of $ 298,178 .
On May 17, 2022, the Company entered
into a second amendment to the Promissory Note that extended the Maturity Date to
November 30, 2023
and increased the interest rate from
6 % to
12 % per annum. All other terms of the Promissory Note remained the same. The change in Maturity Date required an additional year
of interest at the fixed rate of 12% per annum. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company prepaid interest for the period November 30, 2022
until May 30, 2023 on the date of the amendment through the issuance of
47,115

On July 26, 2022 and July 28, 2022, securities class action complaints were filed by purported stockholders of ours in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors. The complaints
allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with the Company’s
relationship with Serhat Gümrükcü and its commercial prospects. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees,
and costs. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaints.

Federal Derivative Litigation .
On September 22, 2022, Samuel E. Koenig filed a shareholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the Central District
of California. On January 19, 2023, John Solak filed a substantially similar shareholder derivative action in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware. Both derivative actions recite similar underlying facts as those alleged in the Securities Class
Action Litigation. The actions, filed on behalf of the Company, name Serhat Gümrükcü and certain of the Company’s
current and former directors as defendants. The actions also name the Company as a nominal defendant. The actions allege violations of
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and also set out claims for breach of fiduciary duty, contribution and
indemnification, aiding and abetting, and gross mismanagement. Plaintiffs do not quantify any alleged injury, but seek damages, disgorgement,
restitution, and other costs and expenses. On January 24, 2023, the United States District Court for the Central District of California
stayed the Koenig matter pending resolution of the defendants’ anticipated motion to dismiss in the Securities Class Action Litigation.
The defendants have not yet responded to either complaint.
State Derivative Litigation .

similar underlying facts as those alleged in the Securities Class Action Litigation. The action, filed on behalf of the Company, names
Serhat Gümrükcü and certain of the Company’s current and former directors as defendants. The action also names the
Company as a nominal defendant. The action sets out claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, contribution, and indemnification, aiding
and abetting, and gross mismanagement. Plaintiff does not quantify any alleged injury, but seeks damages, disgorgement, restitution,
and other costs and expenses. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint.
On October 21, 2022, the Company
filed a Complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against Serhat Gümrükcü,
William Anderson Wittekind, G-Tech Bio LLC, SG & AW Holdings LLC, and Seraph Research Institute. The Complaint alleges that the defendants
engaged in a “concerted, deliberate scheme to alter, falsify, and misrepresent to the Company the results of multiple studies supporting
its [Hepatitis B] and SARS-CoV-2/influenza pipelines.” Specifically, “Defendants manipulated negative results to reflect
positive outcomes from various studies, and even fabricated studies out of whole cloth.” As a result of the defendants’ conduct,
the Company claims that it “paid approximately $25 million to Defendants and third-parties that it would not otherwise have paid.”
The defendants have not yet answered the allegations set forth in the Company’s complaint.
On December 28, 2022, the Company
received a demand letter on behalf of Weird Science LLC (“Weird Science”), William Anderson Wittekind, the William Anderson
Wittekind 2020 Annuity Trust, the William Anderson Wittekind 2021 Annuity Trust, the Dybul 2020 Angel Annuity Trust, and the Ty Mabry
2021 Annuity Trust alleging that the Company breached the February 16, 2018 Investor Rights Agreement between the Company, Weird Science,
and RS Group ApS. Specifically, the demand letter alleges that the Company “breached its obligations under the Investor Rights
Agreement to provide the requisite thirty days’ notice” to Holders of Registrable Securities in connection with SEC Form
S-3 filings on July 13, 2020 and February 11, 2022 and demands over $64 million in damages. The Company denies these allegations and
intends to vigorously defend against this claim.

BioSciences Chief Financial Officer, Robert Wolfe and his company, Crossfield, Inc., filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Vermont against the Company, Enochian BioSciences Denmark ApS, and certain directors and officers. In the Complaint,
Mr. Wolfe and Crossfield, Inc. asserted claims for abuse of process and malicious prosecution, alleging, inter alia, that the Company
lacked probable cause to file and prosecute an earlier action, and sought millions of dollars of compensatory damages, as well as punitive
damages. The allegations in the Complaint relate to an earlier action filed by the Company and Enochian BioSciences Denmark ApS in the
Vermont Superior Court, Orange Civil Division. On March 3, 2022, the court partially granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, dismissing
the abuse of process claim against all defendants and all claims against Mark Dybul and Henrik Grønfeldt-Sørensen. On November
29, 2022, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to the sole remaining claim of malicious prosecution. The Company
denies the allegations set forth in the Complaint and will continue to vigorously defend against the remaining claim.

Our Business
We are
a biotechnology company committed to developing advanced allogeneic cell and gene therapies to promote stronger immune system responses
potentially for long-term or life-long cancer remission in some of the deadliest cancers, and potentially to treat or cure serious infectious
diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
Our Product
Development strategy is anchored in the use of “non-self” or allogeneic cells that enhance the immune response that we seek
to elicit.
Over the past several years, Enochian
BioSciences has evolved from a company with a single product candidate as a potential cure for HIV (ENOB-HV-01), adding two additional
pipeline candidates for HIV (ENOB-HV-12 and ENOB-HV-21), a pipeline for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) (ENOB-HB-01), and with a significant
expansion into cancer immune therapies to address high unmet needs from difficult-to- treat solid tumors (ENOB-DC-11.)
The oncology platform is now at
the forefront of our development activities, beginning with pancreatic cancer.
Many operational aspects of our
platforms can be quickly adapted to multiple disease states from a single therapeutic approach, potentially streamlining and accelerating
development, and regulatory process, as well as manufacturing operations. Moreover, because our product candidates do not require specialized
delivery devices and surgical procedures, our potentially groundbreaking interventions could have worldwide applicability.
The Company responds quickly to
new data and perceived development opportunities and risks assessments. Based on the maturation of our pipelines, the Company makes business
decisions to prioritize the programs that could move more rapidly through development and commercial processes.
Therapeutic Platforms
The Company’s general approach
with gene- and/or cell-therapy is to enhance the immune system to allow a person to better fight diseases. The Company is leveraging
general principals and advances in the knowledge of the immune response to engineer cells with enhanced attributes to promote the recognition
and elimination of diseased cells.
25
Advanced Allogeneic Cell Therapy
The strategic benefit of cell
therapy platforms is to potentially allow for manufacture of large, “off-the-shelf” banks of therapeutic cells that could
be accessed on demand by health care professionals to potentially decrease the time between diagnosis and treatment.
In addition, because we focus
on cells from donors the strategy could potentially enhance the ability of the therapeutic candidates to induce a more robust response
once injected into patients. The human immune system is designed to recognize and distinguish “self” from “non-self”
and destroy “otherness” such as bacteria, viruses, and damaged or diseased cells such as cancer cells. Alloreactivity (reacting
against another person’s cells) is the most powerful response the immune system generates. Several of our technologies take advantage
of the alloreactivity to hyper stimulate a person’s immune response to better attack a chronic infection (e.g., HIV) or solid tumor.
In certain treatments (e.g., HIV
and cancer), cells taken from healthy donors are sometimes genetically modified to introduce signaling molecules that are designed to
enhance the ability of specific immune cells to recognize diseased cells, and to help recruit other cells that will destroy cancer or
virus infected cells.
The Company believes that the
combination of off-the-shelf allogeneic cells, combined with genetic modifications designed to enhance immune signaling, could potentially
generate therapeutic candidates that have unique attributes that will increase the likelihood of success.
Cell Therapy enabling technology
In addition to the platform described
above, Enochian BioSciences has an innovative gene therapy approach to enhance the selection and engraftment (uptake) of cells carrying
therapeutic attributes. Enhanced uptake or engraftment could play a critical role in some cases to increase the likelihood of therapeutic
benefit. This technology was initially developed for autologous cell therapy from a person living with HIV, and genetically modifying
those cells so they cannot be infected with most variants of HIV plus a gene modification to enhance uptake. We have sublicensed under
a profit-sharing agreement our technology to potentially increase engraftment for potential use in CAR-T therapy as a potential cure
for HIV.
HBV Gene Therapy
Enochian BioSciences is exploring
various approaches for gene therapy design elements to potentially eliminate virus-infected cells with an innovative molecular mechanism
that co-opts the virus’ machinery to induce the death of infected cells rather than reproducing and causing more infection to exacerbate
disease.
Oncology:
ENOB-DC-11: Genetically modified
Allogeneic Dendritic Cell Therapeutic Vaccine as Potential Product for Long-term Remission of Solid Tumors – Starting with Pancreatic
Cancer
Allogeneic Cell Therapy Platform
–moderately Advanced Pre-Clinical
Based
on learning from peer-reviewed publications of Phase I/IIa trials, we have designed an innovative therapeutic vaccination platform that
could potentially be used to induce life-long remission from some of the deadliest solid tumors. The survival rate in pancreatic cancer
is currently only 5 to 10 percent at 5 years.
Initial
preclinical
in vitro
and proof of concept
in vivo
studies have been encouraging. The platform might also allow for non-specific
immune enhancement that could have impact against a broad array of solid tumors. We initially plan to target pancreatic cancer. Other
potential targets for later development could include triple-negative breast cancer, glioblastoma, or renal cell carcinoma. As with HIV,
our approach would potentially allow for outpatient therapy without wiping out or significantly impairing the patient’s immune
system, as many current approaches require.
Enochian BioSciences has initiated
a collaboration with Dr. Anahid Jewett from UCLA to study further the
in vitro
and
in vivo
effectiveness of the approach
in pancreatic cancer. Dr. Jewett created an innovative pancreatic cancer mouse model that mimics the human immune system in combination
with implanted human cancer cells. Early results show promising substantial tumor size reduction. We are now fully committed to process
development/improvements and hope to have confirmatory
in vivo
data by early 2023 with potential Pre-IND submission early/mid
2023. If successful, clinical trials in humans could be possible by the first half of 2024.
26
ENOB-DC-12--XX: Genetically
modified Allogeneic Dendritic Cell Therapeutic Vaccine as Potential Product for Long-term Remission of Additional Indications
The technology is a platform that
could potentially be adapted to other solid tumors first line and/or salvage therapy, by itself or, potentially, in combination with
other cancer treatments. Additional indications are being evaluated strategically to balance risk and opportunity to advance therapeutic
development quickly in cancer indications with few treatment options.
Infectious Diseases:
HIV:
ENOB-HV 12: HIV Therapeutic Vaccines for Potential
Long-term Remission/Cure
Allogeneic Cell Therapy Platform
- Advanced Pre-Clinical Stage; Non-Human Primate Studies Ongoing.
In persons living with HIV who
are controlling the spread of virus with anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment, boosting the immune system in a different way than the virus
already has through infection, could allow for control of HIV after stopping ARVs.
Enochian
BioSciences is developing ENOB-HV-12 that utilizes a novel cellular and immunotherapy approach that could potentially provide therapeutic
vaccines for HIV (ENOB-HV-12). A non-human primate study of the therapeutic vaccine in primates at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center is ongoing. Animals began receiving the first injections of the potential therapeutic vaccine in August, 2022. Preliminary results
could potentially be available in the first half of 2023. A Pre-IND request could be submitted by mid-2023, with IND submission and the
beginning of Phase I clinical trials by mid- to end-2024.
ENOB-HV-01: Autologous Transplant with Genetically
Modified Cells :
FDA INTERACT Meeting Held February 2020 - Advanced
Pre-Clinical Stage
We have pioneered a novel enabling
technology (ALDH gene modification) that we believe will allow sufficient engraftment of the CCR5 gene-modified Hematopoietic Stem Cell
(HSC) to eliminate the need for Antiretroviral Treatment (ART.)
Management conducted a successful
FDA INTERACT Meeting in alignment with the Company’s experimental plan. Although
in vitro
and
in vivo
studies have
demonstrated promising results, further development of ENOB-HV-01 at this time was deemed costly and a long-term undertaking. While the
Company plans to return to full development of the approach when resources are available, it has become less attractive and been deprioritized
for business reasons, while pipelines that could move more quickly have been prioritized (e.g., DC-11). Therefore, a business decision
was made to sub-license the ALDH gene modification.
ENOB-HV-01 was sub-licensed to
Caring Cross with a profit share arrangement. Caring Cross is developing a CAR-T approach that they believe, when combined with Enochian
Biosciences ALDH gene modification, could enhance engraftment of their CAR-T cell therapy and enhance their likelihood of success.
ENOB-HV-21: Immunotherapy with Allogeneic NK/GDT
Cells
Allogeneic Cell Therapy Platform -Pre-IND conducted
- Advanced Pre-Clinical with Human Data through a Collaboration
We are also exploring ENOB-HV-21,
an innovative treatment for HIV with allogeneic Natural Killer (NK) and Gamma Delta T-Cells (GDT). It is believed that the GDT cells,
a small subset of immune cells that can be infected with HIV, could both be infected by, and be a key factor in controlling the virus.
The initial scientific findings were presented during the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASCGT) Annual Meeting in 2021.
Enochian BioSciences has an exclusive license to use the underlying patent to develop ENOB-HV-21 for potential treatment or cure of HIV.
A successful investigator-initiated Pre-IND was completed in October 2021. However, due to a shift in priorities to the Oncology pipeline,
Enochian BioSciences does not plan to pursue the IND and potential clinical trial in the near to medium-term.
27
HBV:
ENOB-HB-01: Potential Cure
for HBV
HBV Gene Therapy -Pre-Clinical
ENOB-HB-01 is in an early pre-clinical
phase as we explore various approaches for gene therapy design elements. If those explorations are successful, it is possible we could
begin the regulatory process at the earliest in the first half of 2024. However, our highest priority is currently the oncology platform,
beginning with pancreatic cancer.
Corporate History
We were incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware on January 18, 2011, under the name Putnam Hills Corp. and in 2014 we merged with and changed our name
to DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc. In 2018, we acquired Enochian Biopharma and changed our name to Enochian BioSciences Inc.
Regaining Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements
On each of October 17, 2022, November
23, 2022, and February 16, 2022, we received a notice, or the Notices, from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that
we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), or the “Rule”, because we did not timely file our Form 10-K
for the period ended June 30, 2022 and our Forms 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 with the SEC. The
Rule requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. On February 27, 2023, we filed our
Form 10-K. On March 7, 2023 we filed our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2022 but have not yet filed our Form 10-Q for the
period ended December 31, 2022, and therefore we have not regained compliance with the Rule. We were unable to file the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, 2022 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2022 and December
31, 2022 by their initial deadlines, due to the reasons described in the Notifications of Late Filing on Form 12b-25, filed with the
SEC on September 29, 2022 and November 15, 2022.
If we are unable to maintain compliance
with the Rule or with any of the other continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our securities, which could have
adverse consequences, including a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, reduced liquidity for our securities,
a limited amount of news and analyst coverage and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in
the future.
Going Concern and Management’s Plans
The financial statements included
elsewhere herein for the period ended December 31, 2022, were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as
a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities during the normal course of business.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,118,896, an accumulated deficit of $216,502,705, and total liabilities
of $13,374,307. We have incurred losses from continuing operations, have used cash in our continuing operations, and are dependent on
additional financing to fund operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for
one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The financial statements included elsewhere herein do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
28
Management has reduced overhead
and administrative costs by streamlining the organization to focus around two of its therapies (oncology and a HIV therapeutic vaccine).
The Company has tailored its workforce to focus on these therapies. In addition, management has extended its $1.2 million convertible
notes 12 months out to be payable on February 28, 2024, and the Company intends to attempt to secure additional required funding through
equity or debt financing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any sources of funding. Such additional
funding may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms, and, in the case of equity financing transactions, could result
in significant additional dilution to our stockholders. If we do not obtain required additional equity or debt funding, our cash resources
will be depleted and we could be required to materially reduce or suspend operations, which would likely have a material adverse effect
on our business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom we have business relationships, at least until additional
funding is obtained. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or
other alternatives that could result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us.
Funding that we may receive during
fiscal 2023 is expected to be used to satisfy existing and future obligations and liabilities and working capital needs, to support commercialization
of our products and conduct the clinical and regulatory work to develop our product candidates, and to begin building working capital
reserves.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continues
to evolve. COVID-19 may cause delays in our research activities. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially affected our operations.
However, it has caused delays in the conduct of experiments due to limitations in resources and supply chain issues, in particular for
those conducting experiments. There have also been increases in the cost to conduct animal studies due to staffing and other limitations.
The full extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic may impact our business and operations is subject to future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict.
We continue to monitor the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations and will seek to adjust our activities as appropriate.

party for an abandoned product candidate, $381,986 in consulting expenses, and $226,562 in lab related expenses partially offset by an
increase of $1,365,557 in collaborating partner expenses with CDMO and CRO partners.
The Company recorded other expense
of $89,882 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to other expense of $252,150 for the three months ended December 31,
2021, representing a decrease in other expense of $162,268 or 64%. The variance is primarily due to the change in fair value of the contingent
consideration liability expense of $167,255 incurred in the prior period. The contingent consideration liability was settled in the period
ending September 30, 2022.
The Company recorded other expense
of $599,026 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to other expense of $3,159,412 for the six months ended December 31,
2021, representing a decrease in other expense of $2,560,386 or 81%. The variance is primarily due to the change in fair value of the
contingent consideration liability expense of $2,991,897, in the prior period net of a loss of $419,182 related to the extinguishment
of the contingent consideration liability during the period ending September 30, 2022.
Net Loss
Net loss for the three months
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, was $4,457,748 and $6,582,941, respectively, representing a decrease in loss of $2,125,193 or approximately
32%. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses of $2,011,263 and a decrease in expense
related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $167,255.
Net loss for the six months ended
December 31, 2022, and 2021, was $12,157,508 and $16,994,910, respectively, representing a decrease in loss of $4,837,402 or approximately
28%. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses of $2,461,324, and a decrease in expense
related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2,991,897.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically satisfied
our capital and liquidity requirements through funding from stockholders, the sale of our Common Stock and warrants, and debt financing.
We have never generated any sales revenue to support our operations and we expect this to continue until our therapies or products are
approved for marketing in the United States and/or Europe. Even if we are successful in having our therapies or products approved for
sale in the United States and/or Europe, we cannot guarantee that a market for the therapies or products will develop. We may never be
profitable.
As noted above under the heading
“Going Concern and Management’s Plans,” through December 31, 2022, we have incurred substantial losses. We will need
additional funds for (a) research and development, (b) increases in personnel, and (c) the purchase of equipment, specifically to advance
towards an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) following Pre-IND readouts from the FDA for ENOB-DC11, ENOB-HV-12, ENOB-HV-01,
ENOB-HV-21 and ENOB-HB-01. The availability of any required additional funding cannot be assured. In addition, an adverse outcome in
legal or regulatory proceedings in which we are currently involved or in the future may be involved could adversely affect our liquidity
and financial position. If additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of
our equity or debt securities. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when
needed could materially adversely affect our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations.
31
As of December 31, 2022, the Company
had $4,118,896 in cash and working capital of $(5,902,533) as compared to $9,172,142 in cash and working capital of $3,114,170 as of
June 30, 2022, a decrease of 55% and 290%, respectively.
Assets
Total assets at December 31, 2022,
were $80,273,663 compared to $84,632,663 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease in total assets was primarily due to the decrease in cash
of $5,053,246. The change in cash is primarily attributed to $2,931,334 in research and development costs related primarily to CDMO and
CRO costs, along with approximately $6,666,695 in general and administrative expenses, net of non-cash items, partially offset by an
increase in accounts payable of $3,153,358 due to the timing of cash payments and funding totaling $1,625,000 related to warrants exercised
during the period.
Liabilities
Total liabilities at December
31, 2022, were $13,374,307 compared to $12,013,815 as of June 30, 2022. The increase in total liabilities was primarily related to an
increase of $3,153,358 in accounts payable due to timing of cash payments and $654,730 in other current liabilities related to a financing
arrangement for an insurance policy partially offset by the reduction in the contingent consideration liability of $2,343,318.

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting
Estimates
The methods, estimates, and judgments
that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements.
Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates
regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.
For a summary of our accounting
policies, see Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Item 3.  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
As a “smaller reporting
company” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company is not required to provide the information
required by this Item.
Item 4.  Controls and
Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer (the “Certifying Officers”) are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
and procedures for the Company. The Certifying Officers have designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information is made known to them, particularly during the period in which this Report was prepared.
The Certifying Officers are responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company and used the “Internal Control
over Financial Reporting Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) to conduct
an extensive review of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act, Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of each of the periods covered by this Report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation,
the Certifying Officers concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring
that the information we were required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The deficiency is
attributed to the Company not having adequate resources to address complex accounting matters. This control deficiency will be monitored,
and attention will be given to this matter as we grow.
The Certifying Officers based
their conclusion on the fact that the Company has identified a material weakness in controls over financial reporting, detailed above.
We expect to be deficient in our disclosure controls and procedures until sufficient capital is available to hire the appropriate internal
accounting staff.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no changes in
our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
Securities Class Action Litigation .
On July 26, 2022 and July 28, 2022, securities class action complaints were filed by purported stockholders of ours in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors. The complaints
allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with the Company’s
relationship with Serhat Gümrükcü and its commercial prospects. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees,
and costs. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaints.
Federal Derivative Litigation .
On September 22, 2022, Samuel E. Koenig filed a shareholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the Central District
of California. On January 19, 2023, John Solak filed a substantially similar shareholder derivative action in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware. Both derivative actions recite similar underlying facts as those alleged in the Securities Class
Action Litigation. The actions, filed on behalf of the Company, name Serhat Gümrükcü and certain of the Company’s
current and former directors as defendants. The actions also name the Company as a nominal defendant. The actions allege violations of
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and also set out claims for breach of fiduciary duty, contribution and
indemnification, aiding and abetting, and gross mismanagement. Plaintiffs do not quantify any alleged injury, but seek damages, disgorgement,
restitution, and other costs and expenses. On January 24, 2023, the United States District Court for the Central District of California
stayed the Koenig matter pending resolution of the defendants’ anticipated motion to dismiss in the Securities Class Action Litigation.
The defendants have not yet responded to either complaint.
State Derivative Litigation .
On October 20, 2022, Susan Midler filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, reciting
similar underlying facts as those alleged in the Securities Class Action Litigation. The action, filed on behalf of the Company, names
Serhat Gümrükcü and certain of the Company’s current and former directors as defendants. The action also names the
Company as a nominal defendant. The action sets out claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, contribution and indemnification, aiding and
abetting, and gross mismanagement. Plaintiff does not quantify any alleged injury, but seeks damages, disgorgement, restitution, and
other costs and expenses. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint.
On October 21, 2022, the Company
filed a Complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against Serhat Gümrükcü,
William Anderson Wittekind, G Tech Bio LLC, SG & AW Holdings LLC, and Seraph Research Institute. The Complaint alleges that the defendants
engaged in a “concerted, deliberate scheme to alter, falsify, and misrepresent to the Company the results of multiple studies supporting
its [Hepatitis B] and SARS-CoV-2/influenza pipelines.” Specifically, “Defendants manipulated negative results to reflect
positive outcomes from various studies, and even fabricated studies out of whole cloth.” As a result of the defendants’ conduct,
the Company claims that it “paid approximately $25 million to Defendants and third-parties that it would not otherwise have paid.”
The defendants have not yet answered the allegations set forth in the Company’s Complaint.
On December 28, 2022, the Company
received a demand letter on behalf of Weird Science LLC (“Weird Science”), William Anderson Wittekind, the William Anderson
Wittekind 2020 Annuity Trust, the William Anderson Wittekind 2021 Annuity Trust, the Dybul 2020 Angel Annuity Trust, and the Ty Mabry
2021 Annuity Trust alleging that the Company breached the February 16, 2018 Investor Rights Agreement between the Company, Weird Science,
and RS Group ApS. Specifically, the demand letter alleges that the Company “breached its obligations under the Investor Rights
Agreement to provide the requisite thirty days’ notice” to Holders of Registrable Securities in connection with SEC Form
S-3 filings on July 13, 2020 and February 11, 2022 and demands over $64 million in damages. The Company denies these allegations and
intends to vigorously defend against this claim.
On March 1, 2021, former Enochian
BioSciences Chief Financial Officer, Robert Wolfe and his company, Crossfield, Inc., filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Vermont against the Company, Enochian BioSciences Denmark ApS, and certain directors and officers. In the Complaint,
Mr. Wolfe and Crossfield, Inc. asserted claims for abuse of process and malicious prosecution, alleging, inter alia, that the Company
lacked probable cause to file and prosecute an earlier action, and sought millions of dollars of compensatory damages, as well as punitive
damages. The allegations in the Complaint relate to an earlier action filed by the Company and Enochian BioSciences Denmark ApS in the
Vermont Superior Court, Orange Civil Division. On March 3, 2022, the court partially granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, dismissing
the abuse of process claim against all defendants and all claims against Mark Dybul and Henrik Grønfeldt-Sørensen. On November
29, 2022, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to the sole remaining claim of malicious prosecution. The Company
denies the allegations set forth in the Complaint and will continue to vigorously defend against the remaining claim.
