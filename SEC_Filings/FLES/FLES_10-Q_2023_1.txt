Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business:
Nature of Business –
Auto Parts 4Less
Group, Inc., (the “Company”), formerly The 4Less Group, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December
5, 2007. The Company, under the name MedCareers Group, Inc. (“MCGI”) formally operated a website for nurses, nursing schools
and nurses’ organizations designed for better communication between nurses and the nursing profession.
On November 29, 2018, the Company entered into a transaction
(the “Share Exchange”), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of The
4LESS Corp. (“4LESS”), in exchange for the issuance of (i) nineteen thousand (19,000) shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
(ii) six thousand seven hundred fifty (6,750) shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and (iii) 870 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The
Series C Preferred Shares have a right to convert into common stock of the Company by multiplying the number of issued and outstanding
shares of common stock by 2.63 on the conversion date. The Share Exchange closed on November 29, 2018.  As a result of the Share
Exchange, the former shareholders of 4LESS became the controlling shareholders of the Company. The Share Exchange was accounted for as
a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein 4LESS is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. The capital, share price, and earnings per share amount in these consolidated financial statements for the period
prior to the reverse merger were restated to reflect the recapitalization in accordance with the shares issued as a result of the reverse
merger except otherwise noted.
4LESS was formed as Vegas Suspension & Offroad,
LLC on October 24, 2013 as a Nevada limited liability company and converted to a Nevada corporation with the same name on May 8, 2017.
On April 2, 2018, the Company changed its name to The 4LESS Corp. The Corporation had S Corporation status. The Corporation operates as
an e-commerce auto and truck parts sales company. As a result of the share exchange, The 4Less Group, Inc. is now a holding company operating
through 4LESS and offers products including exhaust systems, suspension systems, wheels, tires, stereo systems, truck bed covers, and
shocks. On December 30, 2019 4LESS changed its name to Auto Parts 4Less, Inc. On April 28, 2022
the Company changed its name from The 4Less Group, Inc. to Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc.
Significant Accounting Policies:
The Company’s management selects accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and adopts methods for their application. The application of accounting
principles requires the estimating, matching and timing of revenue and expense. The accounting policies used conform to generally accepted
accounting principles which have been consistently applied in the preparation of these condensed financial statements.
Basis of Presentation:
The Company prepares its financial statements on the
accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) for interim unaudited consolidated financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete consolidated
financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP have been omitted pursuant to instructions, rules, and regulations prescribed by the SEC. The unaudited consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement
of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the year ended January 31, 2022 and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
on May 9, 2022.

Table of Contents
Principles of Consolidation:
The condensed financial statements include the accounts
of Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. as well as The Auto Parts 4Less, Inc., and JBJ Wholesale LLC. All significant inter-company transactions
have been eliminated. All amounts are presented in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise stated.
Use of Estimates:
In order to prepare financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and determine whether contingent assets and liabilities, if any, are disclosed in the
financial statements. The ultimate resolution of issues requiring these estimates and assumptions could differ significantly from resolution
currently anticipated by management and on which the financial statements are based. The most significant estimates included in these
consolidated financial statements are those associated with the assumptions used to value derivative liabilities.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the Company’s condensed consolidated
financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have
not changed the results of operations of prior periods.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At times, cash balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair market value.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories
are valued on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Inventory is comprised of finished goods. At October 31, 2022 the provision for inventory
obsolescence was $143,000. (January 31, 2022 - $0)
Concentrations
Cost of Goods Sold
For the nine months ended October 31, 2022 the Company purchased approximately
51% of its inventory and items available for sale from third parties from three vendors. As of October 31, 2022, the net amount due to
the vendors included in accounts payable was $426,606. For the nine months ended October 31, 2021 the Company purchased approximately
58% of its inventory and items available for sale from third parties from three vendors. As of October 31, 2021, the net amount due to
the vendors included in accounts payable was $440,977. The Company believes there are numerous other suppliers that could be substituted
should a supplier become unavailable or non-competitive.
Leases
We elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine
the lease term for existing leases. Our election of the hindsight practical expedient resulted in the shortening of lease terms for certain
existing leases and the useful lives of corresponding leasehold improvements. In our application of hindsight, we evaluated the performance
of the leased stores and the associated markets in relation to our overall real estate strategies, which resulted in the determination
that most renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the expected lease term.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized when items of income and expense are recognized in the financial
statements in different periods than when recognized in the tax return. Deferred tax assets arise when expenses are recognized in the
financial statements before the tax returns or when income items are recognized in the tax return prior to the financial statements. Deferred
tax assets also arise when operating losses or tax credits are available to offset tax payments due in future years. Deferred tax liabilities
arise when income items are recognized in the financial statements before the tax returns or when expenses are recognized in the tax return
prior to the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax
Act”) was signed into law. ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes requires companies to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws
and rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and the retroactive effects of changes in tax laws in the period in which the new legislation
is enacted. The Company’s gross deferred tax assets were revalued based on the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate from
35% to 21%. A corresponding offset has been made to the valuation allowance, and any potential other taxes arising due to the Tax Act
will result in reductions to the Company’s net operating loss carryforward and valuation allowance. The Company will continue to
analyze the Tax Act to assess its full effects on the Company’s financial results, including disclosures, for the Company’s
fiscal year ending January 31, 2023, but the Company does not expect the Tax Act to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
The Company’s financial instruments consist
of cash, accounts payable, advances and notes payable. The Company considers the carrying value of such amounts in the financial statements
to approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Derivatives are recorded at fair value at
each period end. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date.
The ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1 Inputs
– Quoted prices for identical
instruments in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs
– Quoted prices for similar
instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations
whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 Inputs
– Instruments with primarily
unobservable value drivers.
The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy,
the Company’s financial liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2022:

Related Party Transactions:
The Company has a verbal policy that includes procedures
intended to ensure compliance with the related party provisions in common practice for public companies. For purposes of the policy, a
“related party transaction” is a transaction in which the Company or any one of its subsidiaries participates and in which
a related party has a direct or indirect material interest, other than ordinary course, arms-length transactions of less than 1% of the
revenue of the counterparty. Any transaction exceeding the 1% threshold, and any transaction involving consulting, financial advisory,
legal or accounting services that could impair a director’s independence, must be approved by the CEO. Any related party transaction
in which an executive officer or a Director has a personal interest, or which could present a possible conflict under the Guide to Ethical
Conduct, must be approved by Board of Directors, following appropriate disclosure of all material aspects of the transaction.
Derivative Liability
The derivative liabilities are valued as a level 3
input under the fair value hierarchy for valuing financial instruments. The derivatives arise from convertible debt where the debt and
accrued interest is convertible into common stock at variable conversion prices and reclassification of equity instrument to liability
due to insufficient shares for issuance. As the price of the common stock varies, it triggers a gain or loss based upon the discount to
market assuming the debt was converted at the balance sheet date. When evaluating the effect of the issuance of new equity-linked or equity-settled
instruments on previously issued instruments, the Company uses first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”) where authorized and unused
shares would first be used to satisfy the earliest issued equity-linked instruments.
The fair value of the derivative liability is determined
using a lattice model, is re-measured on the Company’s reporting dates, and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including
our stock price, historical stock price volatility, the expected term, and both high risk and the risk-free interest rate. The most sensitive
inputs to the model are for expected time for the holder to convert or be repaid and the estimated historical volatility of the Company’s
common stock.  However, because the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock is so high (see Note 9), the sensitivity
required to change the liability by 1% as of October 31, 2022 is greater than 25% change in historical volatility as of that date.  The
other inputs, such as risk free rate, high yield cash rate and stock price all have a sensitivity for a 1% change in the input variable
results in a significantly less than 1% change in the calculated derivative liability.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606,
“Revenue
from Contracts with Customers . The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue when control
is transferred over the promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable
that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer.
The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
Step 1: Identify the contract with the
customer
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price
to the performance obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company
satisfies a performance obligation
Because the Company’s sales agreements generally
have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose
information about its remaining performance obligations.

The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied
at the point in time when products are received by the customer, which is when the customer has title and obtained the significant risks
and rewards of ownership. Therefore, the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation (shipment of product). The Company
primarily receives fixed consideration for sales of product. Shipping and handling amounts paid by customers are primarily for online
orders, and are included in revenue. Sales tax and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue.
Stock-Based Compensation:
The Company accounts for stock options at fair value.
The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and provides
for expense recognition over the service period, if any, of the stock option.
Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share:
Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”)
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
(denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS give effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price
for the period is used to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and/or warrants. Diluted
EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Basic loss per common share is computed based on the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed in a manner similar to the basic loss
per share, except the weighted-average number of shares outstanding is increased to include all common shares, including those with the
potential to be issued by virtue of convertible debt and other such convertible instruments. Diluted loss per share contemplates a complete
conversion to common shares of all convertible instruments only if they are dilutive in nature with regards to earnings per share.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards:
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles
- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) which simplifies goodwill impairment testing by requiring that such periodic testing be performed by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the
carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The policy is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning
after December 15, 2019. We adopted on February 1, 2020 and the adoption had no impact.
Fair Value Measurement : In 2018, the FASB issued
amended guidance to remove, modify and add disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This amendment is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any removed
or modified disclosure requirements. Transition is on a prospective basis for the new and modified disclosures, and on a retrospective
basis for disclosures that have been eliminated. The adoption of this guidance on February 1, 2020 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation
- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvement to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is part of the FASB’s simplification
initiative to maintain or improve the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial statements while reducing cost
and complexity in financial reporting. This update provides consistency in the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees with
that of employees. The updated guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued amended guidance on the accounting and reporting of income taxes. The guidance is intended to simplify the accounting
for income taxes by removing exceptions related to certain intra-period tax allocations and deferred tax liabilities; clarifying guidance
primarily related to evaluating the step-up tax basis for goodwill in a business combination; and reflecting enacted changes in tax laws
or rates in the annual effective tax rate. The Company adopted the new guidance effective February 1, 2021. There was no impact to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

Table of Contents
In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance intended
to clarify certain interactions between accounting standards related to equity securities, equity method investments and certain derivatives.
The guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting and measuring certain purchased options
and forward contracts to acquire investments. The Company adopted the new guidance effective February 1, 2021. There was no impact to
the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
In August 2020, the FASB issued amended guidance on
the accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The guidance removes the separation model for
convertible debt instruments and preferred stock, amends requirements for conversion options to be classified in equity as well as amends
diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations for certain convertible debt instruments. The amended guidance is effective for interim
and annual periods in 2022. The application of the amendments in the new guidance are to be applied either on a modified retrospective
or a retrospective basis. We are currently assessing the effect that the adoption of this standard will have on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements upon adoption
In addition to the above, the Company has reviewed
all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements
will have a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In March 2020, the FASB issued optional guidance to
ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting and subsequently
issued clarifying amendments. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for accounting for contracts, hedging relationships,
and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued
because of reference rate reform. The optional guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied on a prospective basis at any time
between January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial
statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance
that requires acquiring entities to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities in a business combination in accordance with
existing revenue recognition guidance. The amended guidance is effective for interim and annual periods in 2023 and is to be applied prospectively.
Early adoption is permitted on a retrospective basis to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this guidance will
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior acquisitions; however, the impact in future
periods will be dependent upon the contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in future business combinations.
In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to
increase the transparency of transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model
by analogy. The guidance requires annual disclosures of such transactions to include the nature of the transactions and the significant
terms and conditions, the accounting treatment and the impact to the company’s financial statements. The guidance is effective for
annual periods beginning in 2022 and is to be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
There were various other accounting standards and
interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash
flows.
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN AND FINANCIAL POSITION
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an
accumulated deficit of $40,680,508 as of October 31, 2022 and has a working capital deficit at October 31, 2022 of $15,279,670. As of
October 31, 2022, the Company only had cash and cash equivalents of $46,026 and approximately $6,111,000 of short-term debt in default.
The short-term debt agreements provide legal remedies for satisfaction of defaults, none of the lenders of which to this point have pursued
their legal remedies. While the Company has plans to grow its revenues through the new website , at this time, our current liquidity position
raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plan is to raise additional funds
in the form of debt or equity in order to continue to fund losses until such time as revenues can sustain the Company. However, there
is no assurance that management will be successful in being able to continue to obtain additional funding. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 4 – LEASES
We lease certain warehouses and office space. Leases
with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we did not combine lease and
non-lease components.
Most leases include one or more options to renew,
with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 17 years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion.
The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title
or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.
Below is a summary of our lease assets and liabilities at October 31, 2022
and January 31, 2022.

NOTE 5 – CUSTOMER DEPOSITS
The Company receives payments from customers on orders prior to shipment
and these customer deposits on cancelled orders were either returned to the customers subsequent to October 31, 2022 or will remain as
deposits until the item is either delivered and recorded as revenue or cancelled and refunded. At October 31, 2022 the Company had received
$57,856 (January 31, 2022- $530,900) in customer deposits for orders that were unfulfilled at October 31, 2022 and either canceled subsequent
to year end or still awaiting shipment.
NOTE 6 – DEFERRED REVENUE
The Company receives payments from customers on orders prior to shipment
and orders that were unfulfilled at October 31, 2022 because of both normal order processing and fulfillment requirements, and back orders
are recorded as deferred revenue. At October 31, 2022, the Company had received $66,153 (January 31, 2022- $665,143) in customer payments
for orders that were unfulfilled at October 31, 2022 and delivered subsequent to October 31, 2022.
NOTE 7 – SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

The Company had accrued interest payable of $478,271
and $231,412 on the notes at July 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, respectively.
The Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration
under ASC 815-15 “Derivatives and Hedging” and determined that some instruments should be classified as liabilities due to
there being a variable number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options. The instruments are measured
at fair value at the end of each reporting period or termination of the instrument with the change in fair value recorded to earnings.
The fair value of the embedded conversion option resulted in a discount to the note on the debt modification date. For the three months
ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded amortization of debt discount expense of $1,932,722 and $130,139, respectively.
For the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded amortization of debt discount expense of $4,309,329 and $442,075,

the debt is convertible into common stock at variable conversion prices which are linked to the trading and/or bid prices of the Company’s
common stock as traded on the OTC market.
The fair value of the derivative liability is determined
using the lattice model, is re-measured on the Company’s reporting dates, and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including
our stock price, expected stock price volatility, the expected term, and the risk-free interest rate. A summary of the weighted average

Company
The Auto Parts 4Less Group Inc. (“FLES”,
the “ Company ”, “ we ” or “ us ”), the Company described herein, was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 5, 2007, with offices located at 106 W Mayflower, Las Vegas, Nevada 89030. Our phone
number is (702) 267-7100.
Nature of Business –
Auto Parts 4Less
Group Inc.., formerly known The 4Less Group, Inc.and as MedCareers Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “MCGI”), was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 5, 2007.
On November 29, 2018, the Company entered into a transaction
(the “Share Exchange”), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of The
4Less Corp. (“4LESS”), in exchange for the issuance of (i) nineteen thousand (19,000) shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
(ii) six thousand seven hundred fifty (6,750) shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and (iii) 870 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The
Series C Preferred Shares have a right to convert into common stock of the Company by multiplying the number of issued and outstanding
shares of common stock by 2.63 on the conversion date. The Share Exchange closed on November 29, 2018.  As a result of the Share
Exchange, the former shareholders of 4LESS became the controlling shareholders of the Company. The Share Exchange was accounted for
as a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein 4LESS is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. The capital, share price, and earnings per share amount in these consolidated financial statements for the period
prior to the reverse merger were restated to reflect the recapitalization in accordance with the shares issued as a result of the reverse
merger except otherwise noted.
On November 19, 2019 The 4Less Group acquired the
URL Autoparts4Less.com and changed the name of their wholly owned subsidiary from the 4Less Corp. to Auto Parts 4Less, Inc.
On
April 28, 2022 the Company changed its name from
The 4LESS Group, Inc. to Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc.
Our Business
Like many small businesses, Christopher Davenport,
the founder of Auto Parts 4Less (“4Less”) previously named The 4less Corp., the wholly owned subsidiary of Auto Parts 4Less
Group, Inc., began selling auto parts on eBay and shipping those items out of his garage in 2013.  What started out as a hobby, quickly
grew into a fully functioning ecommerce aftermarket auto parts company that required a significant technical staff and facilities to support
their growth. In June of 2015, they leased their first office.
Originally the company listed their auto parts in
the different marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart and Jet.
Starting in 2016 the company began investing to become
their own ecommerce platform thereby allowing their auto parts to be direct listed across marketplace and social media sites. Technical
achievements including CRM system, warehouse integration API, warehouse inventory software to name a few.
- 28 -
Table of Contents
In 2019, shortly after the share exchange with MedCareers
Group, Inc., with technology upgrades in place, 4Less began successfully moving majority of sales from third party marketplaces direct
to their proprietary ecommerce web site Liftkits4Less.com. By doing so the company saves 8%-10% in fees charged by the major marketplace’s
such as e-Bay and Amazon as well as further building the 4less brand as a leading ecommerce site for auto parts.
On November 19, 2019 the Company acquired the URL
Autoparts4Less.com and changed the name of their wholly owned subsidiary from the 4Less Corp. to Auto Parts 4Less, Inc. With the acquisition
of the URL AutoParts4Less.com, the Company also began focusing all of their efforts and resources on building out a flagship automotive
marketplace with the potential to offer buyers a wide range of automotive parts for cars, trucks,
boats, motorcycles and RV’s on a single platform.
In August 2021
the Company launched a beta test version of Autoparts4less.com. In a short period of time after the beta launch the company realized that
with the amount of interest received from numerous types of larges sellers, which included not only ecommerce sites presently selling
parts online, but also interest from other large parts sellers such as warehouse distributors, new car dealers with large inventories
of parts as well as brick and mortar parts retailers looking to move sales online, the platform originally created would soon be inadequate.
As such, the Company made the decision to upgrade to a larger and more advanced platform solution so they immediately began implementation
of the AWS Fargate serverless platform solution.
The platform upgrade was completed
in the 1 st
quarter FYE 2023, with marketplace sales expected to begin in 3 rd
quarter 2023.
On November 2, 2022 the Company announced
that it had officially launched what is believed to be the industry’s first pure-play automotive parts-only marketplace,
AutoParts4Less.com, with approximately 2 million parts listed from over 25 parts sellers. Additionally,
with the slowdown of the economy including purchases of auto parts accessories such as lift kits, exclusively designed for trucks and
SUV’s, the company decided to discontinue operations of their ecommerce website Liftkits4less.com in mid-November to focus entirely
on growing their parts marketplace, AutoParts4Less.com. By doing so they also expect to reduce monthly operating costs to under 300k a
month for the foreseeable future.
On April 28.
2022 the Company changed its name from The 4Less Group, Inc. to Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc.
Competition
We believe that our automotive parts marketplace AutoParts4less.com,
with no known large challengers presently in the space outside of “all things to all people” online marketplaces Amazon and
eBay, has the opportunity to quickly be branded when launched as the auto part’s industry premier marketplace just as sites like
Etsy, Wayfair, Uber and Chewey’s have been able to successfully do in their industries.

We had total revenue of $4,089,037 for the nine months ended October 31,
2022, compared to $9,425,519 for the nine months ended October 31, 2021. Sales decreased by $5,340,482 primarily due to present economic
conditions reducing consumer demand as well as supply chain issues. In the prior year’s quarter, sales were driven by high consumer
demand as a result of economic stimulus packages provided during the pandemic and an aggressive marketing push by the Company. In current
Q3 the Company began winding its website Liftkits4less in anticipation of the November 2022 launch of its new automotive parts marketplace
AutoParts4Less.com. The Company also recorded $66,153 in deferred revenue, which will be recognized as revenue next quarter and recognized
$665,143 of deferred revenue recorded January 31, 2022. The deferred revenue represents orders paid by customers this period but delivered in
the following period due to back orders and processing and delivery times. The Company also recorded $57,856 in customer deposits and
recognized $530,900 recorded January 31, 2022. The customer deposits are orders paid by customers and canceled in the following period
due to back orders or other reasons. For the prior year period, the Company recorded $241,292 in deferred revenue, which was recognized
as revenue the next quarter and recognized $687,766 of deferred revenue that was recorded January 31, 2021. For the nine months ended
October 31, 2022, the Company also recorded $220,776 in customer deposits and recognized $188,385 recorded January 31, 2021.
Both proprietary website revenues and third party
website revenues fell by 57% as the Company transitions from a seller of accessories to a pure-play automotive parts-only marketplace.
Gross Profit
We had gross profit of $792,491 for the nine months
ended October 31, 2022, compared to gross profit of $2,454,393 for the nine months ended October 31, 2021. Gross profit decreased by $1,661,902
as a result of the decreased revenues explained above and also due to an increase in cost because the Company had to purchase goods at
higher product costs from distributers rather than the usual manufacturers for many of the new available products or some of the products
that were not available from the usual manufacturers due to still existing supply chain issues. The 2022 gross profit was further reduced
by a $143,000 provision on inventory which will be sold off in the coming quarter on transitioning to the new AutoParts4Less.com website.

•   Depreciation increased by $2,657
due to asset additions at the end of fiscal 2022, thus a higher asset value is being depreciated.
•   Postage shipping and freight decreased
by $283,143 due to lower sales.
•   Marketing and advertising decreased
by $1,205,228 due to aggressive promotional efforts in the prior period to drive sales to our proprietary websites and build our brands.
For the nine months ended October 31, 2022, the spending has resumed to usual levels and in Q32022 we reduced advertising in anticipation
on new website launch in November.
•   E Commerce Services, Commissions
and Fees decreased by $83,782 due to lower sales.
•   Operating lease cost decreased
by $1,260.
•   PPP loan forgiveness in 2021 was
a non-recurring item.
•   Personnel Costs decreased by $573,196
due to staff reductions as a result of lower demand.
- 30 -
Table of Contents
•   General and Administrative increased
by $166,176 mainly due to stock-based compensation of $1,998,000 on the CEO’s 250,000 options. This was partially reduced by reductions
of 1,831,823 across all other general and administrative accounts as the Company focused on reducing its costs in a declining market.
Investor relations were lower as a result of the REG A subscription offering in the prior year and there was also a reduction in professional
fees due to associated reporting and business requirements of the afore-mentioned REG A subscription from the prior year’s quarter.

The changes above can be explained by the increase in convertible debt
that started at the end of last fiscal year and continued for the nine months ended October 31, 2022. Convertible debt increased from
$949,300 at October 31, 2021 to $8,141,250 at October 31, 2022. As a result all debt related items such as amortization of debt discount
and interest expense increased significantly. The higher loss on derivatives in 2022 is a function of the market factors in the valuation
of the derivative liability described in Note 9 of the included financial statements as well as the derivative discounts acquired with
the new debt.
We had net loss of $12,228,775 for the nine months
ended October 31, 2022, compared to net income of $4,886,380 for the nine months ended October 31, 2021. The increase in net loss was
mainly due to the large increase in other expenses, the lower sales and the increase in stock-based compensation as explained in the discussion
above.

by $452,730 due to aggressive promotional efforts in 2021 to drive sales to our proprietary websites and build our brands. For the quarter
ended October 31, 2022 minimal advertising was done in anticipation on new website launch in November.
•   E Commerce Services, Commissions
and Fees decreased by $38,767 due to lower sales.
•   Operating lease cost decreased
by $1,259.
•   Personnel Costs decreased by $187,319
due to staff reductions as a result of lower demand.
•   PPP loan forgiveness in Q3 2021
was a non-recurring item.
•   General and Administrative decreased
by $1,338,313 due to the Company reducing its expenses in a declining market. Investor relations were lower as a result of the REG A subscription
offering in the prior year and there was also a reduction in professional fees due to associated reporting and business requirements of
the afore-mentioned REG A subscription from the prior year’s quarter.

The changes above can be explained by the increase
in convertible debt this quarter ended October 31, 2022. Convertible debt increased from $949,300 at October 31, 2021 to $8,141,250
at October 31, 2022. so accordingly there were large increases in amortization expense and interest expense. The higher loss on derivatives
is a function of the market factors in the valuation of the derivative liability described in Note 9 as well as the increase in derivative
discount resulting from the new debt issuances.
We had a net loss of $4,131,691 for three months ended
October 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of $2,566,574 for three months ended October 31, 2021. The decrease in net income was mainly
due to the large increase in other expenses and the lower sales as explained in the discussion above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Management believes that we will continue to incur
losses for the immediate future. Therefore, we will need additional equity or debt financing until we can achieve profitability and positive
cash flows from operating activities, if ever. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of assets or the classification
of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
As of October 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $46,026, net inventory
of $142,251 and $15,532,213 in current liabilities. At the current cash consumption rate, we will need to consider additional funding
sources going forward. We are taking proactive measures to reduce operating expenses and drive growth in revenue.
The successful outcome of future activities cannot
be determined at this time and there is no assurance that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our intended business
plan or generate positive operating results.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
about Market Risk.
Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§
229.305(e)), we are not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company,”
as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).
ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
(a)           Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness
of our “ disclosure controls and procedures ” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “ Evaluation Date ”), has concluded
that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Moving forward, we hope that our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer will be able to devote the
additional time and effort required so that our disclosure controls and procedures can become effective. Notwithstanding the assessment
that our internal controls and procedures were not effective, we believe that our financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report
for the quarter ended October 31, 2022 fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years and months
covered thereby in all material respects.
