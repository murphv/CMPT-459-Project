EXTREME NETWORKS, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
1.
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Extreme Networks, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Extreme” or the “Company”), is a leader in providing software-driven networking solutions for enterprise customers. The Company conducts its sales and marketing activities on a worldwide basis through distributors, resellers and the Company’s field sales organization. Extreme was incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Extreme included herein have been prepared under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted under such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2022 was derived from audited financial statements as of that date but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented and the financial condition of Extreme at December 31, 2022. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for fiscal 2023 or any future periods.
Fiscal Year
The Company uses a fiscal calendar year ending on June 30. All references herein to “fiscal 2023” represent the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. All references herein to “fiscal 2022”  represent the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Extreme and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The Company predominantly uses the United States Dollar as its functional currency. The functional currency for certain of its foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local functional currency environment, all assets and liabilities are translated to United States Dollars at current month end rates of exchange and revenues and expenses are translated using the monthly average rate.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
For a description of significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2022-06,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 , which extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance under ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. Upon issuance of ASU 2020-04, the Company elected to apply certain of the optional expedients for contract modifications to its financial instruments impacted by the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) discontinuance. The Company expects to continue to elect various optional expedients for contract
8
modifications to
the Company ’s
financial instruments affected by the reference rate reform through the effective date of December 31, 2024, as extended by ASU 2022-06. The application of this guidance did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements .
3.
Revenues
The Company accounts for revenues in accordance with ASU 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts from Customers
(Topic 606) . The Company derives the majority of its revenues from sales of its networking equipment, with the remaining revenues generated from sales of services and subscriptions, which primarily includes maintenance contracts and software subscriptions delivered as software as a service (“SaaS”) and additional revenues from professional services, and training for its products. The Company sells its products, maintenance contracts and SaaS direct to customers and to partners in
two
distribution channels, or tiers. The first tier consists of a limited number of independent distributors that stock its products and sell primarily to resellers. The second tier of the distribution channel consists of non-stocking distributors and value-added resellers that sell directly to end-users. Products and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages.
Revenue Recognition
Performance Obligations.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in Topic 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
Certain of the Company’s contracts have multiple performance obligations, as the promise to transfer individual goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, is distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells these products. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates the stand-alone selling prices using other observable inputs .
The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefits provided. Substantially all of the Company’s product sales revenues are recognized at a point in time. Substantially all of the Company’s service, subscription, and SaaS revenues are recognized over time. For revenues recognized over time, the Company uses an input measure, days elapsed, to measure progress.
On December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 445.6
million of remaining performance obligations, which are primarily comprised of deferred maintenance and SaaS revenues. The Company expects to recognize approximately  36 % of its deferred revenue as revenue in the remainder of fiscal 2023, an additional  34 % in fiscal 2024 and
30 % of the balance
thereafter .
Contract Balances.
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable and deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Services provided under renewable support arrangements of the Company are billed in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, which are either billed fully at the inception of contract or at periodic intervals (e.g., quarterly or annually). The Company sometimes receives payments from its customers in advance of services being provided, resulting in deferred revenues. These liabilities are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
Revenue recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each period was $ 83.9
million and $ 81.9
million, respectively. Revenue recognized for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each period was $ 145.7
million and $ 132.5
million, respectively.
Contract Costs.
The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Management expects that commission fees paid to sales representatives as a result of obtaining service and subscription contracts and contract renewals are recoverable and therefore the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets included capitalized balances in the amount of $ 17.5
million and $ 16.3
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Capitalized commissions are included within other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized commission fees are amortized on a
straight-line basis
over the average period of service contracts of approximately
three years , and are included in “Sales and marketing” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Amortization recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $  2.2
million and $ 1.8
million, respectively. Amortization recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 4.3
million and $ 3.6
million, respectively.
Estimated Variable Consideration.
There were no material changes in the current period to the estimated variable consideration for performance obligations, which were satisfied or partially satisfied during previous periods.

Business Combination
Fiscal 2022 Acquisition
Ipanema Acquisition
On
September 14, 2021
(the “Acquisition Date”), the Company
completed its acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of Ipanematech SAS (“Ipanema”), the cloud-native enterprise Software-Defined Wide Area Network (“SD-WAN”) business unit of Infovista pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Acquisition, the net consideration paid by Extreme to Ipanema stockholders was $ 70.9
million, which was funded through cash on hand. The primary reason for the acquisition was to acquire the talent and the technology to allow the Company to expand its portfolio with new cloud-managed SD-WAN and security offerings to support its enterprise customers.
The Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the acquired assets and liabilities of Ipanema have been recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of the Company including an amount for goodwill calculated as the difference between the acquisition consideration and the fair value of the identifiable net assets.
The purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Of the total purchase consideration, $ 68.9
million was allocated to goodwill, $ 16.3
million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net tangible liabilities assumed. All valuations were finalized as of June 30, 2022.
The unaudited pro forma results of operations reflect the Acquisition as if it had occurred on July 1, 2020, the beginning of fiscal 2021, after giving effect to purchase accounting adjustments relating to depreciation and amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration costs.
The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the combined results that would have occurred had the acquisition been consummated as of the beginning of fiscal 2021, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results. The unaudited pro forma results do not include the impact of synergies, nor any potential impacts on current or future market conditions, which could alter the unaudited pro forma results.
The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 combines the historical results for Extreme for that period, which include the results of Ipanema subsequent to the Acquisition Date, and Ipanema’s historical results up to the Acquisition Date.

Balance Sheet Accounts
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis, or net realizable value. Extreme uses a standard cost methodology to determine the cost basis for its inventories. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company adjusts the carrying value of its inventory when conditions exist that suggest that inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Any previously written down or obsolete inventory subsequently sold has not had a material impact on gross margin for any of the periods presented.

Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue represents amounts for deferred maintenance, support, SaaS, and other deferred revenue including professional services and training when the revenue recognition criteria have not been met.
Guarantees and Product Warranties
The majority of the Company’s hardware products are shipped with either a
one-year
warranty or a limited lifetime warranty, and software products receive a
90 -day warranty. Upon shipment of products to its customers, the Company estimates expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrues a liability in cost of product revenues for this amount. The determination of the Company’s warranty requirements is based on actual historical experience with the product or product family, estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment. The Company estimates and adjusts these accruals at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors.

To facilitate sales of its products in the normal course of business, the Company indemnifies its resellers and end-user customers with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the customer harmless against losses arising for intellectual property infringement and certain other losses. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. It is not possible to estimate the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not had a material impact on its operating results or financial position.
Concentrations
The Company may be subject to concentration of credit risk as a result of certain financial instruments consisting of accounts receivable. See Note 3, Revenues, for the Company’s accounts receivable concentration. The Company does not invest an amount exceeding
10 % of its combined cash in the securities of any one obligor or maker, except for obligations of the United States government, obligations of United States government agencies and money market accounts.
6.
Fair Value Measurements
A three-tier fair value hierarchy is utilized to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 Inputs - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2 Inputs - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and
•
Level 3 Inputs - unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions in measuring the asset or liability at fair value.
The following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 (in thousands).

Level 1
Assets and Liabilities :
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The Company states accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment.
Level 2
Assets and Liabilities :
The fair value of derivative instruments under the Company’s foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps are estimated based on valuations provided by alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs which is considered Level 2.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments with notional principal amounts of $ 11.1
million and $ 9.6
million, respectively. These contracts have maturities of
60
days
or less. Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments are included in other income or expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, there were net gains of $ 0.1
million and net losses of $ 0.4
million, respectively. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, there were net losses of less than $ 0.1
million and $ 0.2
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts that were designated as hedging instruments with a notional principal amount of $ 5.5
million. These contracts have maturities of less than
twelve months . Gains and losses arising from these contracts designated as hedging instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2022, these contracts had an unrealized gain of $ 0.4
million. As of June 30, 2022, there were
no
outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that were designated as hedging instruments. See Note 13, Derivatives and Hedging, for additional information.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps are based upon inputs corroborated by observable market data which is considered Level 2. As of
December 31, 2022
and June 30, 2022 , the Company had interest rate swap contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, with the total notional amount of $ 75.0
million. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022 ,
these contracts had unrealized gains of $ 0.8
million and $ 1.3
million, respectively.
See Note 13, Derivatives and Hedging, for additional information.
The fair value of borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 8) is estimated based on valuations provided by alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs which is considered Level 2. Since the interest rate is variable for the 2019 Credit Agreement, the fair value approximates the face amount of the Company’s indebtedness of $ 262.0
million and $ 308.6
million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
Level 3 Assets and Liabilities:
Certain of the Company’s assets, including intangible assets and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated.
As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the Company did
no t have any asset or liability that were considered Level 3.
There were
no
transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 .
There were
no
impairments recorded for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

On August 9, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2019 Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company, as borrower,
several banks and other financial institutions as Lenders,
BMO Harris Bank N.A., as an issuing lender and swingline lender,
Silicon Valley Bank, as an Issuing Lender, and
Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders.
The 2019 Credit Agreement provides for a
five-year
first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 380.0
million and a
five-year
revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 75.0
million (the “2019 Revolving Facility”). In addition, the Company may request incremental term loans and/or incremental revolving loan commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of $ 100.0
million, plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain financial tests. On August 9, 2019, the Company used the additional proceeds from the term loan
to   partially fund the acquisition of Aerohive Networks, Inc. and for working capital and general corporate purposes .
At the Company’s election, the initial term loan under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be made as either base rate loans or Eurodollar loans. The applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from
0.25 % to
2.50 % per annum and the applicable margin for Eurodollar loans ranges from
1.25 % to
3.50 %, in each case based on Extreme’s consolidated leverage ratio. All Eurodollar loans are subject to a Base Rate of
0.00 %.  In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of between
0.25 % and
0.40 % quarterly (currently
0.25 %) on the unused portion of the 2019 Revolving Facility, also based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. Principal installments are payable on the new term loan in varying percentages quarterly starting December 31, 2019 and to the extent not previously paid, all outstanding balances are to be paid at maturity. The 2019 Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets.
The 2019 Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain certain minimum financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes covenants and restrictions that limit, among other things, the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens upon any of its property, merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default which may result in acceleration of the payment of the outstanding balance.
On
April 8, 2020 , the Company entered into an amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement (the “First Amendment”) to waive certain terms and financial covenants of the 2019 Credit Agreement through July 31, 2020. On
May 8, 2020 , the Company entered into a second amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”), which superseded the First Amendment and provided certain revised terms and financial covenants through March 31, 2021. The Second Amendment required the Company to maintain certain minimum cash requirement and financial metrics at the end of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2021 and the Company was restricted from pursuing certain activities such as incurring additional debt, stock repurchases, making acquisitions or declaring a dividend, until the Company was in compliance with the original covenants of the 2019 Credit Agreement.
On
November 3, 2020 , the Company and its lenders entered into a Third Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”), to increase the sublimit for letters of credit to $ 20.0
million. On
December 8, 2020 , the Company and its lenders entered into a fourth amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment”), to waive and amend certain terms and financial covenants within the 2019 Credit Agreement through March 31, 2021.
The Second Amendment provided for the Company to end the covenant Suspension Period early and revert to the covenants and interest rates per the original terms of the 2019 Credit Agreement dated August 9, 2019 by filing a Suspension Period Early Termination Notice and Covenant Certificate demonstrating compliance. For the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2021, the Company’s financial performance was in compliance with the original covenants defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement and, as such, the Company filed a Suspension Early Termination Notice and Covenant Certificate with the administration agent subsequent to filing the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2021. Returning to compliance, the original terms and
16
financial covenants under
the 2019 Credit Agreement dated August 9, 2019
resu med in effect. During
the three and
six
months ended
December
3 1 , 2022, the Company was in compliance with all the terms and financial covenants under the 2019 Credit Agreement .
Financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining long-term financing are deferred and amortized over the term of the related indebtedness or credit agreement. Amortization of deferred financing costs included in “Interest expense” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operati ons were $ 0.7
million for each of the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and totaled $ 1.5
million for each of the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The interest rate as of December 31, 2022 was
5.5 % and as of December 31, 2021 was
1.86 %.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any   outstanding balance against its 2019 Revolving Facility’s outstanding balance. The Company had $ 60.2
million of availability under the 2019 Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company made an additional payment of $ 30.0
million and $ 12.0
million against its term loan facility, respectively.
The Company had $ 14.8
million of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2022.

Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments
The Company currently has arrangements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for the manufacture of its products. Those arrangements allow the contract manufacturers to procure long lead-time component inventory based upon a rolling production forecast provided by the Company. The Company is obligated to purchase long lead-time component inventory
that its contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast, unless the Company gives notice of order cancellation outside of applicable component lead-times . As of December 31, 2022, the Company had commitments to purchase $ 57.1
million of inventory.
Legal Proceedings
The Company may from time to time be party to litigation arising in the course of its business, including, without limitation, allegations relating to commercial transactions, business relationships or intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Litigation in general, and intellectual property in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company records accruals for certain of its outstanding legal proceedings, investigations or claims when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, at least on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations or claims that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as any developments that would result in a loss contingency to become both probable and reasonably estimable. When a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not record a loss accrual. However, if the loss (or an additional loss in excess of any prior accrual) is at least reasonably possible and material, then the Company would disclose an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss, if such estimate can be made, or disclose that an estimate cannot be made. The assessment whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Even if a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may not be able to estimate a range of possible loss, particularly where (i) the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large number of parties. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including the amount of any possible loss, fine or penalty.  However, an adverse resolution of one or more of such matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year.
XR Communications, LLC d/b/a Vivato Technologies v. Extreme Networks, Inc.

On February 1, 2018, Orckit IP, LLC (“Orckit”) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company and its Irish and German subsidiaries in the District Court in Dusseldorf, Germany. The lawsuit alleges direct and indirect infringement of the German portion of a patent (“EP ‘364”) based on the offer, distribution, use, possession and/or importation into Germany of certain network switches that are equipped with the ExtremeXOS operating system. Orckit is seeking injunctive relief, accounting, and an unspecified declaration of liability for damages and costs of the lawsuit. On January 28, 2020, the Court rendered a decision in the infringement case in favor of the Company. The matter is proceeding through the appellate process.
On April 23, 2019, Orckit filed an extension of the patent infringement complaint against the Company and its Irish and German subsidiaries in the District Court in Dusseldorf, Germany. With this extension, Orckit alleges infringement of the German portion of a second patent (“EP ‘077”) based on the offer, distribution, use, possession and/or importation into Germany of certain network switches that the Company no longer sells in Germany. Orckit is seeking injunctive relief, accounting and sales information, and a declaration of liability for damages as well as costs of the lawsuit. On October 13, 2020, the Court issued an infringement decision against the Company and granted Orckit the right to enforce t he judgment against the Company, which Orckit has provided notification to the Company that it will enforce the judgment . In the rendering of account, Orckit was informed that the products at issue were in end of sale status prior to the filing of the EP ‘077 complaint. The Company has appealed the infringement decision, and t he matter is proceeding through the appellate process .
The Company filed a nullity action related to the EP ‘364 patent on May 3, 2018, and one related to the EP ‘077 patent on October 31, 2019, both in the Federal Patent Court in Munich. The Federal Patent Court in Munich found the EP ‘364 patent to be valid and the Company has filed an appeal. On October 25, 2022, the Federal Patent Court in Munich issued an opinion partially invalidating the EP ‘077 patent and the Company has filed an appeal.

On October 26, 2020, SNMP Research, Inc. and SNMP Research International, Inc. (collectively, “SNMP”) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Eastern District of Tennessee for copyright infringement, alleging that the Company was not properly licensed to use its software.  SNMP is seeking actual damages and profits attributed to the infringement, as well as equitable relief. The Company filed a motion to transfer the case to the Northern District of California. The motion to dismiss was denied in part and denied without prejudice in part.

mediation from January 19 to January 26, 2023. The trial date set for February 2023 has been rescheduled to January 2024.
Mala Technologies Ltd. v. Extreme Networks GmbH, Extreme Networks Ireland Ops Ltd., and Extreme Networks, Inc.
On
April 15, 2021, Mala Technologies Ltd. (“Mala”) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company and its Irish and German subsidiaries in the District Court in Dusseldorf, Germany.  The lawsuit alleges indirect infringement of the German portion of a patent (“EP ‘498”) based on the offer and sale in Germany of certain network switches equipped with the ExtremeXOS operating system.  Mala is seeking injunctive relief, accounting, and an unspecified declaration of liability for damages and costs of the lawsuit . On December 20, 2022, the trial court ruled that the Company did not infringe the EP ‘498 patent and dismissed Mala’s complaint entirely. Mala has filed an appeal.
The Company filed a nullity complaint against EP ‘498 with the German Federal Patent Court on September 24, 2021. This matter is still pending.
Indemnification Obligations
Subject to certain limitations, the Company may be obligated to indemnify its current and former directors, officers and employees. These obligations arise under the terms of its certificate of incorporation, its bylaws, applicable contracts, and applicable law. The obligation to indemnify, where
applicable , generally means that the Company is required to pay or reimburse, and in certain circumstances the Company has paid or reimbursed, the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possible damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with certain legal matters. The Company also procures Directors and Officers liability insurance to help cover its defense and/or indemnification costs, although its ability to recover such costs through insurance is uncertain.  While it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential amount that could be owed under these governing documents and agreements due to the Company’s limited history with prior indemnification claims, indemnification (including defense) costs could, in the future, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Stockholders’ Equity
Stockholders’ Rights Agreement
On May 17, 2021, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the “2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan”), which amended and restated the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement between the Company and Computershare Shareholder Services LLC, as the rights agent. The 2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan was approved by stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting of stockholders held on November 4, 2021. The 2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan governs the terms of each right (“Right”) that has been issued with respect to each share of common stock of Extreme Networks. Each Right initially represents the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of the Company’s Preferred Stock.
The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) adopted the 2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan to preserve the value of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry forwards of the Company, with respect to its ability to fully use its tax benefits to offset future income which may be limited if the Company experiences an “ownership change” for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as a result of ordinary buying and selling of shares of its common stock. Following its review of the terms of the plan, the Board decided it was necessary and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to enter into the 2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan.
Equity Incentive Plan
The Compensation Committee of the Board unanimously approved an amendment to the Extreme Networks, Inc. Amended and Restated 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”) on September 12, 2022 to increase the maximum number of available shares by
6.5
million shares. The amendment was approved by the stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting of stockholders held on November 17, 2022.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Compensation Committee of the Board unanimously approved an amendment to the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) on September 9, 2021 to increase the maximum number of shares that will be available for sale thereunder by
7.5
million shares. The amendment was approved by the stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting of stockholders held on November 4, 2021.
Common Stock Repurchases
On May 18, 2022, the Company announced the Board had authorized management to repurchase up to $ 200.0
million of shares of the Company’s common stock over a
three-year
period commencing July 1, 2022 (as amended, the “2022 Repurchase Program”). Initially, under the 2022 Repurchase program, a maximum of $ 25.0
million of shares was authorized to be repurchased in any quarter; however, on November 17, 2022, the Board increased the authorization to repurchase shares in any quarter from up to $ 25.0
million of shares per quarter to up to $ 50.0
million of shares per quarter. Purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased a total of
2,578,175
shares of its common stock on the open market at a total cost of $ 49.8
million with an average price of $ 19.32

1,829,333
shares of its common stock on the open market at total cost of $ 25.0
million with an average price of $ 13.65

The fair value of each stock option grant under the 2013 Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free rate is based upon the estimated life of the option and the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility on the Company’s stock. There were
no
stock options granted during the  three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There were
no
stock options exercised during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.
Stock Awards
Stock awards may be granted under the 2013 Plan on terms approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Stock awards generally provide for the issuance of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) including performance-condition or market-condition RSUs which vest over a fixed period of time or based upon the satisfaction of certain performance criteria or market conditions. The Company recognizes compensation expense on the awards over the vesting period based on the awards’ fair value as of the date of grant. The Company does not estimate forfeitures, but accounts for them as incurred.

The RSUs granted under the 2013 Plan vest over a period of time, generally one to three years, and are subject to participant's continued service to the Company .  The stock awards granted during the six months ended December 31, 2022 included
1.4
million RSUs including the market condition awards discussed below to named executive officers and directors.
Market Condition Awards
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board granted
1.0
million and
0.7
million RSUs, respectively, with vesting based on market conditions (“MSU”) to certain of the Company’s executive officers. These MSUs vest based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the Russell 2000 Index (“Index”).   The MSU award represents the right to receive a target number of shares of common stock of up to
150 % of the original grant, as indicated in the table below. The MSUs vest based on the Company’s TSR relative to the TSR of the Index over performance periods of three years from the grant date, subject to the grantees’ continued service through the certification of performance.

Total shareholder return is calculated based on the average closing price for the 30-trading days prior to the beginning and end of the performance periods. Performance is measured based on three periods, with the ability for up to one-third of target shares to vest after years one and two and the ability for up to the maximum of the full award to vest based on the full three-year TSR less any shares vested based on one- and two-year periods.
Linear interpolation is used to determine the number of shares vested for achievement between target levels.
The grant date fair value of each MSU was determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the MSUs granted during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 16.57
per share. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation included the expected volatility of
67 %, risk-free rate of
3.12 %,
no
expected dividend yield, expected term of
three years
and possible future stock prices over the performance period based on the historical stock and market prices. The Company recognizes the expense related to these MSUs on a graded-vesting method over the estimated term.
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the MSUs granted during the six months ended December 31, 2021 was $ 12.69
per share. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation included the expected volatility of
66 %, risk-free rate of
0.44 %,
no
expected dividend yield, expected term of
three years
and possible future stock prices over the performance period based on the historical stock and market prices.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The fair value of each share purchase option under the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. The expected term of the ESPP represents the term of the offering period of each option. The risk-free rate is based upon the estimated life and on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility on the Company’s common stock.
There were
0.7
million and
1.0
million shares issued under the ESPP during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The following assumptions were used to determine the grant-date fair values of the ESPP shares during the following periods:

Derivatives and Hedging
Interest Rate Swaps
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its debt. The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to effectively manage the impact of fluctuations of interest rate changes on its outstanding debt which has a floating interest rate. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
At the inception date of the derivative contract, the Company performs an assessment of these contracts and has designated these contracts as cash flow hedges. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, by performing qualitative and quantitative assessment, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow of hedged items. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. In accordance with ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging,” the Company may prospectively discontinue the hedge accounting for an existing hedge if the applicable criteria are no longer met, the derivative instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised or if the Company removes the designation of the respective cash flow hedge. In those circumstances, the net gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings, unless the forecasted transaction is no longer probable in which case the net gain or loss is reclassified into earnings immediately.
During fiscal 2020, the Company entered into multiple interest rate swap contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge the variability of cash flows in interest payments associated with the Company’s various tranches of floating-rate debt. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amount of these interest rate swaps were $ 75.0
million and $ 200.0
million, respectively, and had maturity dates through
April 2023 . As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, these contracts had unrealized gains of $ 0.8
million and unrealized losses of $ 0.3
million, respectively, and are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” with the associated asset in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” or with the associated liability in “Other accrued liabilities,” respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows associated with periodic settlements of interest rate swaps are classified as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Realized gains and losses are recognized as they accrue in interest expense. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to these cash flow hedges are reclassified to interest expense over the life of the swap contracts. The Company estimates that $ 0.8
million will be reclassified to interest income over the next twelve months. The classification and fair value of these cash flow hedges are discussed in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements.
Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency that may or may not be designated as hedging instruments. The Company’s objective for holding derivatives is to use the most effective methods to minimize the impact
22
of these exposures. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts
primarily
to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by foreign currency transactions related to certain operating expenses and re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies .
For foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value of the Company’s derivatives in a gain position are recorded in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and derivatives in a loss position are recorded in “Other accrued liabilities” in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in “Other income, net” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments had a total notional principal amounts of $ 11.1
million and $ 20.4
million, respectively. These contracts have maturities of
60
days or less. The net gains and losses recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations from these contracts during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were net gain of $ 0.1
million and net loss of $ 0.4
million, respectively, and during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 there were net losses of less than $ 0.1
million and $ 0.2
million, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as hedging instruments, gains and losses arising from these contracts are recorded as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The hedging gains and losses in “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” are subsequently reclassified to expenses, as applicable, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect the Company’s earnings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 ,
foreign exchange forward contracts designated as hedging instruments had the notional amount of $ 5.5
million and $ 5.7
million, respectively. These contracts have maturities of less than
twelve months ,
and unrealized gains and losses arising from these contracts designated as hedging instruments are recorded as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” .
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, these contracts had unrealized gain of $ 0.4
million and unrealized loss of $ 0.3
million respectively.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized total foreign currency gain of less than $ 0.1
million and losses of less than $ 0.1
million, respectively, and for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized total foreign currency gains of $ 0.8
million and $ 0.3
million, respectively, related to the change in fair value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
14.
Restructuring and Related Charges
The Company recorded $ 0.5
million and $ 1.0
million of restructuring and related charges during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, which included additional facilities charges related to previously impaired facilities.   As of June 30, 2022, the Company has completed all the restructuring activities under the 2020 Plan noted below and
no
restructuring liabilities remain in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company recorded $ 0.3
million and $ 0.6
million of restructuring and related charges during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 which primarily included additional facility related expenses related to previously impaired facilities. The Company had minimal activity related to the 2020 Plan during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Severance and benefit restructuring charges consisted primarily of employee severance and benefit expenses incurred under the reduction-in-force action initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 (the “2020 Plan”) to reduce operating costs and enhance financial flexibility as a result of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic. With the reduction and realignment of the headcount under the 2020 Plan, the Company relocated certain of its lab test equipment to third-party consulting companies. The Company incurred $ 9.6
million of charges under the 2020 Plan through June 30, 2022.
Restructuring liabilities related to severance, benefits, and equipment relocation obligations are recorded in “Other accrued liabilities” in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the restructuring liability was less than $ 0.1
million.
15.
Income Taxes
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $ 2.6
million and $ 1.8
million, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $ 4.4
million and $ 3.9
million, respectively.
The income tax provisions for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, consisted of (1) taxes on the income of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, (2) foreign withholding taxes, (3) state taxes in jurisdictions where the Company has no remaining state net operating losses (“NOLs”) and (4) tax expense associated with the establishment of a U.S. deferred tax liability for amortizable goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Enterasys Networks, Inc., the wireless local area network business from
23
Zebra Technologies Corporation, the Campus Fabric Business from Avaya and the Data Center Business
from Brocade. The interim income tax provisions for the
three and six months ended December 31, 2022
and
2021
were calculated using the discrete effective tax rate method as allowed by ASC 740-270-30-18,
Income Taxes – Interim Reporting .
The discrete method is applied when the application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The discrete method treats the year - to - date period as if it was the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis.  The Company believes that, at this time, the use of this discrete method is more appropriate than the annual effective tax rate method as (i) the estimated annual effective tax rate method is not reliable due to the high degree of uncertainty in estimating annual pretax earnings
on a jurisdictional basis
and (ii) the Company’s ongoing assessment that the recoverability of
certain
U . S .
and Irish
deferred tax assets is not
more
likely
than not .
The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against all of its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as well as a portion of the deferred tax assets in Ireland. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that deferred tax assets are recoverable including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, changes to enacted tax laws, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. The Company’s inconsistent earnings in recent periods, including a cumulative loss over the last three years, coupled with its difficulty in forecasting future revenue trends by jurisdiction and the cyclical nature of its business represent sufficient negative evidence to require full valuation allowances against its U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets as well as a portion of the deferred tax assets in Ireland.  These valuation allowances will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or in whole if business results and the economic environment have sufficiently improved to support realization of some or all of the Company's deferred tax assets. In the event the Company changes its determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, it will adjust its valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
On September 14, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Ipanema. This acquisition is treated as a non-taxable stock acquisition and, therefore, Extreme will have carryover tax basis in the assets and liabilities acquired. A deferred tax liability has been established for the non-deductible amortization of the associated intangibles under US GAAP.
The Company had $ 18.4
million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022. If fully recognized in the future, $ 0.3
million would impact the effective tax rate and $ 18.1
million would result in adjustments to deferred tax assets and corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance with no impact to the effective tax rate.  The Company does not anticipate any events to occur during the next twelve months that would materially reduce the unrealized tax benefit as currently stated in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of tax expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In general, the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities for fiscal years 2001 forward due to NOLs and the Company’s state income tax returns are subject to examination for fiscal years 2000 forward due to NOLs. The Company is not currently under audit for income tax purposes in any material jurisdictions.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended December 31, 2022 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including in particular, our expectations regarding market demands, customer requirements and the general economic environment, future results of operations, and other statements that include words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution investors that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors identified in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Report, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, and other filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risk factors, include, but are not limited to: risks related to supply chain disruptions; fluctuations in demand for our products and services; a highly competitive business environment for network switching equipment; our effectiveness in controlling expenses; the possibility that we might experience delays in the development or introduction of new technology and products; customer response to our new technology and products; fluctuations in the global economy, including political, social, economic, currency and regulatory factors (such as the outbreak of COVID-19); risks related to pending or future litigation; a dependency on third parties for certain components and for the manufacturing of our products and our ability to receive the anticipated benefits of acquired businesses.
Business Overview
The following discussion is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and service parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. For further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section included in this “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Extreme Networks, Inc. (“Extreme” or “Company”) is a leading provider of cloud networking solutions and industry leading services and support. Extreme designs, develops, and manufactures wired, wireless, and software-defined wide area-network (“SD-WAN”) infrastructure equipment. The Company’s cloud solution is a single platform that offers unified network management of wireless access points, switches, and SD-WAN. It leverages machine learning, Artificial Intelligence Operations and analytics to help customers deliver secure connectivity at the edge of the network, speed cloud deployments and uncover actionable insights saves time, lowers costs and streamlines operations. Extreme is currently managing more than two million devices in the cloud.
Extreme has been pushing the boundaries of networking technology since 1996, driven by a higher purpose of helping our customers connect beyond the network. Extreme’s cloud networking technologies provide flexibility and scalability in deployment, management, and licensing of networks globally. Our global footprint provides service to more than 50,000 customers and 10 million daily end users across the world including some of the world’s leading names in business, hospitality, retail, transportation and logistics, education, government, healthcare, manufacturing and service providers. We derive all our revenues from the sale of our networking equipment, software subscriptions, and related maintenance contracts.
Industry Background
Enterprises are adopting new Information Technology (“IT”) delivery models and applications that require fundamental network alterations and enhancements spanning from the access edge to the data center. As networks become more complex and more distributed in nature, we believe IT teams in every industry will need more control and better insights than ever before to ensure secure, distributed connectivity and comprehensive centralized visibility. Machine Learning (“ML”) and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) technologies have the potential to vastly improve the network experience in the post-pandemic world by collating large data sets to increase accuracy and derive resolutions to improve the operation of the network. When ML and AI are applied with cloud-driven networking and automation, administrators can quickly scale to provide productivity, availability, accessibility, manageability, security, and speed, regardless of the distribution of the network.
As the edge of the network continues to expand, our customers are faced with managing more endpoints. With that comes a host of challenges. This continued expansion creates issues such as: a higher risk of cyberattacks, an increase in applications running across the network which creates a need for more bandwidth.
With more endpoints to manage, application performance suffers, and the tug on internal systems and IT staff becomes more intense. There are more alarms, more IT tickets and often time technology that is being overworked. Most times they have little visibility into the root cause of the problem and are left trying to pinpoint where, when and how these issues exist. Meanwhile, organizational productivity suffers.
26
We believe that t he network has never been more vital
and strategic
than it is today. As administrators grapple with more data, coming from more places, more connected devices, and more
Software-as-a-service (“ SaaS ”)
based
applications, the cloud is fundamental to establishing a new normal.
Traditional network offerings are not well-suited to fulfill enterprise expectations for rapid delivery of new services, more flexible business models, real-time response, and massive scalability.
As enterprises continue to migrate increasing numbers of applications and services to either private clouds or public clouds offered by third parties and to adopt new IT delivery models and applications, they are required to make fundamental network alterations and enhancements spanning from device access points (“AP”) to the network core. In either case, the network infrastructure must adapt to this new dynamic environment. Intelligence and automation are key if enterprises are to derive maximum benefit from their cloud deployments. With automation applications becoming increasingly critical in manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, healthcare and other key industries, we believe this will continue to create demand for networking technology to serve as a foundation to run these services.
Service providers are investing in network enhancements with platforms and applications that deliver data insights, provide flexibility, and can quickly respond to new user demands and 5G use cases.
We believe Extreme will continue to benefit from the use of its technology to manage distributed campus network architecture centrally from the cloud. Extreme has blended a dynamic fabric attach architecture that delivers simplicity for moves and changes at the edge of the network together with corporate-wide role-based policy. This enables customers to migrate to new cloud managed switching, Wi-Fi, and SD-WAN, agnostic of the existing switching or wireless equipment they already have installed. In the end, we expect these customers to see lower operating and capital expenditures, lower subscription costs, lower overall cost of ownership and more flexibility along with a more resilient network.
We estimate the total addressable market for our Enterprise Networking solutions consisting of cloud networking, wireless local area networks (“WLAN”), data center networking, ethernet switching, campus local area networks (“LAN”), and SD-WAN solutions to be approximately $33 billion and growing at approximately 12% annually over the next three years. This comprises of $22 billion for campus networking, $4.6 billion for 5G service available market in 5G and data centers, for which Extreme is targeting growing to approximately $50 - $100 million per year over the next three to five years, and a $2.2 billion SD-WAN market. We also participate in the $4 billion networking software market for solutions such as cloud-based network management, network automation, on-premises network management, and other networking related software.

Product gross profit increased $19.7 million or 19.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The increase
in product gross profit was primarily due to increased product revenues
along with
lower amortization of intangibles due to certain intangibles being fully amortized , lower distribution costs due to easing of supply chain constraints, partially offset by higher product costs and higher excess and obsolete inventory.
Product gross profit increased $22.0 million or 10.8% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The increase in product gross profit was primarily due to increased product revenues along with lower amortization of intangibles due to certain intangibles being fully amortized, partially offset by higher product costs, higher overhead costs and higher excess and obsolete inventory.
Service and subscription gross profit increased $3.2 million or 5.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022.  Service and subscription gross profit increased $12.0 million or 10.9% for the
six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The
increases in service and subscription gross profits were primarily due to increased service and subscription revenues, partially offset by higher cloud services costs.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (which consist of compensation, benefits and share-based compensation), consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design, development, and testing of our products.
Research and development expenses increased by $4.5 million or 9.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in personnel costs due to higher compensation costs primarily related to share-based compensation, a $0.4 million increase in consultant fees, a $0.9 million increase in software licenses and engineering project costs, a $0.7 million increase in equipment related costs, a $0.4 increase in facility and information technology costs and a $0.5 million increase in other costs primarily related to travel and recruiting expenses.
Research and development expenses increased by $7.8 million or 8.1% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022.

Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (which consist of compensation, benefits and share-based compensation), as well as trade shows and promotional expenses.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $9.0 million or 12.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was
primarily due to a
$7.0
million increase in personnel costs due to higher compensation and benefits costs primarily related to higher commissions and share-based compensation, a $1.3 million increase in travel costs and a $0.9 million increase in marketing and facilities related costs, partially offset by a
$0.2
million decrease in equipment and other expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased by $6.2 million or 34.7% for
the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in personnel costs due to higher compensation and benefits costs primarily related to share-based compensation, a $1.4 million increase in professional service fees and a $2.3 million increase in litigation charges, partially offset by a net $0.4 million decrease in facilities and other costs.

Acquisition and Integration Costs
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we did not incur any acquisition and integration costs . During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $0.4 million, which primarily  consisted of professional fees and certain compensation charges related to the acquisition of Ipanema.
During the
three and six months ended December 31, 2021 , we incurred $2.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of acquisition and integration costs, which primarily  consisted of professional fees for legal advisory services, system and product integrations and financial services related to the acquisition of Ipanema.
Restructuring and Related Charges
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of facility-related charges related to our previously impaired facilities.
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of facility related charges related to our previously impaired facilities.
Amortization of Intangibles
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of operating expenses for amortization of intangibles. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The decreases were primarily due to lower amortization related to certain acquired intangibles from previous acquisitions becoming fully amortized.
Interest Expense
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $3.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in interest expense. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $7.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively, in interest expense. The increases in interest expense were primarily driven by rising interest rates on our
2019 Credit Agreement .
Other Income, Net
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded other income, net of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded other income, net of $0.5
million and $0.2 million, respectively. The changes for the
three and six months ended December 31, 2022
was primarily due to foreign exchange impact from the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars.
Provision for Income Taxes
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded an income tax provision of $2.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded an income tax provision of $4.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
32
The income tax provisions for the
three and six months ended December 31, 2022
and 20 2 1
consisted of (1) taxes on the income of
our
foreign subsidiaries, (2) foreign withholding taxes, (3)
state taxes in jurisdictions where we have no remaining state net operating losses and (4)
tax expense associated with the establishment of a U.S. deferred tax liability for amortizable goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Enterasys Networks, Inc., the WLAN Business, the Campus Fabric Business and the Data Center Business.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted under SEC rules and regulations. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
As discussed in Part II, Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, we consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements:
•
Revenue Recognition
•
Inventory Valuation and Purchase Commitments
There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies since the filing of our last Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of $202.5 million, accounts receivable, net of $152.1 million, and available borrowings under our
five-year 2019 Revolving Facility
of $60.2 million. Our principal uses of cash include the purchase of finished goods inventory from our contract manufacturers, payroll and other operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our products, purchases of property and equipment, and repayments of debt and related interest. We believe that our $202.5 million of cash at December 31, 2022, our cash flow from operations, and the availability of borrowings from the 2019 Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months.
On May 18, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to $200.0 million shares of our common stock over a three-year period commencing July 1, 2022. A maximum of $25.0 million may be repurchased in any quarter. On November 17, 2022, the Board increased the authorization to repurchase in any quarter from $25.0 million per quarter to $50.0 million per quarter. Purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or pursuant to 10b5-1 plan. The manner, timing and amount of any future purchases will be determined by our management based on their evaluation of market conditions, stock price, Extreme’s ongoing determination that it is the best use of available cash and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate Extreme to acquire any shares of its common stock, may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice and will be subject to regulatory considerations. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased a total of 2,578,175 shares of common stock on the open market at a total cost of $49.8 million. As of December 31, 2022, we have $150.2 million available under our share repurchase program.

On
August 9, 2019, we entered into the 2019 Credit Agreement. The 2019 Credit Agreement provides for a
five -year first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $380 .0
million and a
five -year revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75 .0
million (“2019 Revolving Facility”). In addition, we may request incremental term loans and/or incremental revolving loan commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of $100 .0
million plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain financial tests.  On August 9, 2019, we used the proceeds to partially fund the acquisition of Aerohive and for working capital and general corporate purposes .
At our election, the initial term loan (the “Initial Term Loan”) under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be made as either base rate loans or Eurodollar loans. The applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0.25% to 2.50% per annum and the applicable margin for Eurodollar loans ranges from 1.25% to 3.50%, in each case based on Extreme’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. All Eurodollar loans are subject to a Base Rate floor of 0.00%.
The 2019 Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets.
The 2019 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain minimum financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes covenants and restrictions that limit, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens upon any of our property, merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, which may result in acceleration of the outstanding balance.
Financial covenants under the 2019 Credit Agreement require us to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge and consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter through maturity.  The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes covenants and restrictions that limit, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens upon any of our property, merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default which may result in acceleration of the outstanding balance.
On April 8, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to waive certain terms and financial covenants of the 2019 Credit Agreement through July 31, 2020. On May 8, 2020, we entered into a Second Amendment which superseded the First Amendment and provided certain revised terms and financial covenants through March 31, 2021. The Second Amendment required us to maintain certain minimum cash requirement and financial metrics at the end of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2021   and we were restricted from pursuing certain activities such as incurring additional debt, stock repurchases, making acquisitions or declaring a dividend, until we came into compliance with the original covenants of the 2019 Credit Agreement. On November 3, 2020, we and our lenders entered into a Third Amendment to increase the sublimit for letters of credit to $20.0 million. On December 8, 2020, we and our lenders entered into a Fourth Amendment to waive and amend certain terms and financial covenants within the 2019 Credit Agreement through March 31, 2021.
The Second Amendment provided for us to end the covenant Suspension Period early and revert to the covenants and interest rates per the original terms of the 2019 Credit Agreement dated August 9, 2019 by filing a Suspension Period Early Termination Notice and Covenant Certificate demonstrating compliance. For the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2021, our financial performance was in compliance with the original covenants defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement and as such we filed a Suspension Early Termination Notice and Covenant Certificate with the administration agent subsequent to filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2021. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all the original terms and financial covenants under the 2019 Credit Agreement.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash flows provided by operations in the six months ended December 31, 2022, were $120.3 million, including our net income of $30.5 million and non-cash expenses of $50.3 million for items such as amortization of intangibles, share-based compensation, depreciation, reduction in carrying amount of right-of-use assets, deferred income taxes, and interest. Other sources of cash for the period included a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable, accrued compensation and deferred revenue. This was partially offset by increases in inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets and decreases in operating lease liabilities and other current and long-term liabilities.
Cash flows provided by operations in the six months ended December 31, 2021 were $62.5 million, including our net income of $26.0 million and non-cash expenses of $54.1 million for items such as amortization of intangibles, share-based compensation, depreciation, reduction in carrying amount of right-of-use assets, deferred income taxes and interest. Other sources of cash for the period included a decrease in accounts receivable and increase in deferred revenue. This was partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets and decreases in accounts payable, accrued compensation, operating lease liabilities and other current and long-term liabilities.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash flows used in investing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $6.3 million for the purchases of property and equipment.
Cash flows used in investing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2021 were $76.2 million primarily due to the payment of $69.5 million (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of Ipanema and $6.7 million for the purchases of property and equipment.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash flows used in financing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $105.6 million due primarily to debt repayments of $46.6 million,
$2.0 million for deferred payments on acquisitions, share repurchase of $49.8 million under our share repurchase program, and
$7.2 million for taxes paid on vested and released stock awards net of proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).
Cash flows used in financing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2021 were $59.4 million due primarily to debt repayments of $23.9 million, share repurchases of $25.0 million under our share repurchase program, payment of
contingent consideration of $0.8 million, $2.0 million for deferred payments on acquisitions and $7.7 million for taxes paid on vested and released stock awards net of proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock under our ESPP and exercise of stock options.
Foreign Currency Effect on Cash
Foreign currency effect on cash decreased in the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and particularly the Indian Rupee, the UK Pound, and the EURO.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2022, we had contractual obligations resulting from our debt arrangement, agreements to purchase goods and services in the ordinary course of business and obligations under our operating lease arrangements.
Our debt obligations relate to amounts owed under our 2019 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we had $262.0 million of debt outstanding which are payable on quarterly installments through our fiscal year 2025. We are subject to interest rate on our debt obligations and unused commitment fee. See Note 8,
Debt ,
in the
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations.
Our unconditional purchase obligations represent the purchase of long lead-time component inventory that our contract manufacturers procure in accordance with our forecast. We expect to honor the inventory purchase commitments within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, we had non-cancelable commitments to purchase $57.1 million of inventory. See Note 9,
Commitments and Contingencies , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding our purchase obligations.
We have contractual commitments to our suppliers which represent commitments for future services. As of December 31, 2022, we had contractual commitments of $44.7 million that are due through our fiscal year 2027.
We lease facilities under operating lease arrangements at various locations that expire at various dates through our fiscal year 2032. As of December 31, 2022, the value of our obligations under operating leases was $47.7 million.
We have immaterial income tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of those liabilities.
We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2022.
35
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Sensitivity
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt and foreign currencies.
Debt
At certain points in time, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, primarily in the form of variable rate borrowings from the 2019 Credit Agreement, which is described in Note 8,
Debt , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.  At December 31, 2022, we had $262.0 million of debt outstanding, all of which was from the 2019 Credit Agreement.  During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the average daily outstanding amount was $271.4 million, with a high of $271.5 million and a low of $262.0 million.
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
In conjunction with our term loan under the 2019 Credit Agreement, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with large financial institutions. This involves the receipt of variable rate amounts from these institutions in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments without exchange of the underlying notional amount of $200.0 million of our debt. The derivative instruments hedge the impact of the changes in variable interest rates. We record the changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” until termination of the derivative agreements.
The following table presents hypothetical changes in interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, on borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement and interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2022, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in thousands):

Exchange Rate Sensitivity
A majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in United States Dollars. While we conduct some sales transactions and incur certain operating expenses in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant, in part because of our foreign exchange risk management process discussed below.
36
Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts
We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the foreign currency forecast transactions related to certain operating expenses and re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by re-measurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, had a notional amount of $11.1 million and $20.4 million, respectively.
These contracts have maturities of less than 60 days. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in “other income, net”.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had forward foreign currency contracts designated as hedging instruments with a notional amount of $5.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
These contracts have maturities of less than twelve months. Gains and losses arising from these contracts designated as hedging instruments are recorded as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”. As of
December 31, 2022 and
2021, these contracts had unrealized gain of $0.4 million and unrealized loss of $0.3 million, respectively, which are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” with the associated asset or liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from operations were gains of less than $0.1 million and losses of less than $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from operations were gains of $0.8 million and $0.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a – 15(f) and 15d – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our control system’s objective will be met, and our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Extreme Networks have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Notwithstanding these limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are, in fact, effective at the “reasonable assurance” level.
