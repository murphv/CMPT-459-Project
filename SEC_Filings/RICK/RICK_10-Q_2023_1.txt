Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “RCIHH,” “we,” or “us”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” or “U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q of Regulation S-X. They do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The September 30, 2022 consolidated balance sheet data were derived from audited financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 14, 2022. The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the financial statements, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending September 30, 2023 . 2.
Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . This ASU amends ASC 805 to require acquiring entities to apply ASC 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in business combinations. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are still evaluating the impact of this ASU but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . The amendments of this ASU clarify that an entity should measure the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual sale restriction the same way it measures an identical equity security that is not subject to such a restriction. The FASB said the contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not affect its fair value. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are still evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 3.
Current Operating Environment
Our fiscal 2020 was the period hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic caused by significant reduction in customer traffic in our clubs and restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as social distancing practices, dining room closures and other restrictions were mandated or encouraged by federal, state and local governments. In fiscal 2021, our businesses started to recover from the initial effects of the pandemic when government restrictions eased. Stimulus money also flowed to the economy at that time which prompted increased discretionary spending. In fiscal 2022, several coronavirus variants threatened to bring back tight restrictions. Along with the pandemic, geopolitical and macroeconomic events started to affect the U.S. economy in general, with global inflation and supply chain disruption impacting our businesses the most. Geopolitical and macroeconomic events are still developing. In the event global inflation leads to a major economic downturn, our business operations and cash flow could be significantly affected. 4.
Acquisitions and Dispositions Lubbock Property On October 10, 2022, the Company purchased real estate in Lubbock, Texas amounting to $ 3.4
million for a future Bombshells location. The Company paid $ 1.1
million in cash at closing and entered into a bank financing for the $ 2.3
million remainder (see Note 7). The site includes extra land that will be listed for sale once the Bombshells unit is completed. 10 Table of Contents RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Non-Income-Producing Properties • On October 11, 2022, the Company purchased a hangar in Arcola, Texas amounting to $ 754,000
in cash.
• On February 6, 2023, in view of the increasing business presence of the Company in the Denver, Colorado area, the Company acquired a non-income-producing corporate property for $ 458,000
in cash. Heartbreakers Gentlemen's Club On October 26, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a club in Dickinson, Texas for a total acquisition price of $ 9.0  million. The acquisition includes (1) $ 2.5  million for the adult entertainment business covered in a stock purchase agreement paid fully in cash at closing and (2) $ 6.5  million for the real estate property covered in a real estate purchase agreement paid $ 1.5  million in cash at closing and $ 5.0  million under a
6 %
15-year
promissory note (see Note 7). In the stock purchase agreement, the Company acquired
100 % of the capital stock of the company which owned the adult entertainment business. The acquisition gives the Company its first adult club in the Galveston, Texas area market. As of the filing of this report, we have not completed our valuation analysis and related calculations in sufficient detail necessary to arrive at the fair values of the net assets acquired and the debt consideration, but we have preliminarily allocated the acquisition price $ 64,000
to current assets, $ 6.5  million to property and equipment, and $ 2.4  million to goodwill based on the negotiated purchase price. We believe that in this acquisition goodwill represents the existing customer base of the club in the area and the added synergy profitability expansion when we implement the Company's processes into the club. Since we do not have yet the fair value for the assets for the taxable portion of the business combination, we have not yet determined the amount of tax-deductible goodwill. In connection with the acquisition, we incurred approximately $ 23,000
in acquisition-related expenses, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income. From the date of acquisition until December 31, 2022, the club contributed revenue of $ 347,000
and income from operations of $ 57,000 , which are included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income.
The seller has not maintained historical U.S. GAAP financial data and it is impracticable to prepare them, therefore, we could not provide supplemental pro forma information of the combined entities. Aurora CO Property On November 8, 2022, the Company purchased real estate in Aurora, Colorado amounting to $ 850,000
in cash for a future Bombshells location. Central City CO Casino Property 1 On December 5, 2022, the Company purchased real estate in Central City, Colorado amounting to $ 2.4  million in cash for the development of a Rick's Cabaret Steakhouse and Casino business.

The transactions contemplated by these agreements have not yet closed as of the filing of this report. Closing is subject to certain closing conditions. Mark IV Property 11 Table of Contents RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.

Grange Food Hall On December 20, 2022, the Company purchased a food hall property in Greenwood Village, Colorado for $ 5.3  million, including direct transaction costs and net of certain accrued taxes amounting to $ 102,000 . The purchase price was paid $ 1.9  million in cash at closing and $ 3.325  million under a
6.67 %
five-year
promissory note (see Note 7). The Company allocated $ 2.1  million to land, $ 2.6  million to building improvements, $ 98,000
to furniture, fixtures and equipment, and $ 565,000
to in-place leases based on their relative fair values. Tomball Parkway Property Sale On December 28, 2022, the Company sold a property classified as held-for-sale with a carrying value of $ 1.0
million for $ 1.7
million in cash. The Company used $ 1.2
million of the proceeds to pay off a loan related to the property. Central City CO Casino Property 2 On February 6, 2023, the Company purchased real estate in Central City, Colorado amounting to $ 2.2  million in cash for the development of another casino and restaurant business. BMB San Antonio On February 7, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a previously franchised Bombshells location in San Antonio, Texas for a total acquisition price of $ 3.2  million. The transaction was effected through a membership interest purchase agreement under which a subsidiary of the Company purchased
100 % of the issued and outstanding membership interests of the target limited liability company that owns and operates the Bombshells location from the six previous owners of the entity (the "Sellers"). At acquisition date, the Sellers were paid $ 1.2  million in cash and were issued
six
seller-financed promissory notes totaling $ 2.0  million (see Note 7). Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the filing date of this report, we have not completed our valuation analysis and related calculations to arrive at the fair values of the net assets acquired, any liabilities assumed, and the debt consideration, along with the determination of any goodwill or gain on the transaction. The Company is not providing supplemental pro forma disclosures to this acquisition as it does not materially contribute to the consolidated operations of the Company. 12 Table of Contents RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.

Stock-based Compensation On February 7, 2022, our board of directors approved the 2022 Stock Option Plan (the “2022 Plan”). The board’s adoption of the 2022 Plan was approved by the shareholders during the annual stockholders' meeting on August 23, 2022. The 2022 Plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock underlying options that may be granted under the 2022 Plan is
300,000 . The options granted under the 2022 Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified options. The 2022 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors. The compensation committee has the exclusive power to select individuals to receive grants, to establish the terms of the options granted to each participant, provided that all options granted shall be granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the common stock covered by the option on the grant date, and to make all determinations necessary or advisable under the 2022 Plan. On February 9, 2022, the board of directors approved a grant of
50,000
stock options each to
six
members of management subject to the approval of the 2022 Plan. Stock-based compensation for the three months ended December 31, 2022, which is included in corporate segment selling, general and administrative expenses, amounted to $ 941,000 . As of December 31, 2022, we had unrecognized compensation cost amounting to $ 6.1
million related to stock-based compensation awards granted, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
3.1
years. The February 9, 2022 stock options vest over
four years
with the first
20 % having vested on the approval of the 2022 Plan at the 2022 annual stockholders' meeting on August 23, 2022, and
20 % vesting on February 9 of each year thereafter,
16 Table of Contents RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) provided however that the options will be subject to earlier vesting under certain events set forth in the Plan, including without limitation a change in control. All of the options will expire, if not vested, at the end of
five years . The weighted average grant-date fair value of the stock options was $ 31.37 . No stock options were exercised during the three months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022,
60,000
stock options were vested and exercisable. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we excluded
60,000
stock options from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect was anti-dilutive. There were no stock options outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Aside from the outstanding stock options, there were no other potentially dilutive securities for inclusion in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 9.
Income Taxes Income tax expense was $ 3.0
million and $ 2.9
million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax expense rate was

21.7 % for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Our effective income tax rate is affected by state taxes, permanent differences, and tax credits, including the FICA tip credit, for both years, as presented below.

Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters Texas Patron Tax A declaratory judgment action was brought by
five
operating subsidiaries of the Company to challenge a Texas Comptroller administrative rule related to the $ 5
per customer Patron Tax Fee assessed against Sexually Oriented Businesses. An administrative rule attempted to expand the fee to cover venues featuring dancers using latex cover as well as traditional nude entertainment. The administrative rule was challenged on both constitutional and statutory grounds. On November 19, 2018, the Court issued an order that a key aspect of the administrative rule is invalid based on it exceeding the scope of the Comptroller’s authority. On March 6, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, ruled that the Texas Patron Tax is unconstitutional as it has been applied and enforced by the Comptroller. The State of Texas appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who affirmed that the Texas Patron Fee is unconstitutional as applied. The State of Texas next sought review from the Supreme Court, but the high court declined to take the case. That lawsuit is now back before the trial court for post-trial proceedings but is final for purposes of determining the Texas Patron Fee is unconstitutional as applied to clubs featuring dancers using latex cover.
Indemnity Insurance Corporation As previously reported, the Company and its subsidiaries were insured under a liability policy issued by Indemnity Insurance Corporation, RRG (“IIC”) through October 25, 2013. The Company and its subsidiaries changed insurance companies on that date. 17 Table of Contents RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) On November 7, 2013, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Rehabilitation and Injunction Order (“Rehabilitation Order”), which declared IIC impaired, insolvent and in an unsafe condition and placed IIC under the supervision of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware (“Commissioner”) in her capacity as receiver (“Receiver”). The Rehabilitation Order empowered the Commissioner to rehabilitate IIC through a variety of means, including gathering assets and marshaling those assets as necessary. Further, the order stayed or abated pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer until May 6, 2014. On April 10, 2014, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Liquidation and Injunction Order With Bar Date (“Liquidation Order”), which ordered the liquidation of IIC and terminated all insurance policies or contracts of insurance issued by IIC. The Liquidation Order further ordered that all claims against IIC must have been filed with the Receiver before the close of business on January 16, 2015 and that all pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer were further stayed or abated until October 7, 2014. As a result, the Company and its subsidiaries no longer had insurance coverage under the liability policy with IIC. The Company has retained counsel to defend against and evaluate these claims and lawsuits. We are funding
100 % of the costs of litigation and will seek reimbursement from the bankruptcy receiver. The Company filed the appropriate claims against IIC with the Receiver before the January 16, 2015 deadline and has provided updates as requested; however, there are no assurances of any recovery from these claims. It is unknown at this time what effect this uncertainty will have on the Company. As previously stated, since October 25, 2013, the Company has obtained general liability coverage from other insurers, which have covered and/or will cover any claims arising from actions after that date. As of December 31, 2022, we have
1
remaining unresolved claim out of the original
71
claims. Shareholder Derivative Action On January 21, 2022, Shiva Stein and Kevin McCarty filed a shareholder derivative action in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division against former director Nourdean Anakar, Yura Barabash, former director Steven L. Jenkins, Eric Langan, Luke Lirot, former CFO Phillip K. Marshall, Elaine J. Martin, Allan Priaulx, and Travis Reese as defendants, as well as against RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. as nominal defendant. The action, styled Stein v. Anakar, et al., No. 4:22-mc-00149 (S.D. Tex.), alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty based on alleged dissemination of inaccurate information, alleged failure to maintain internal controls, and alleged failure to properly manage company property. This action is in its preliminary phase, and a potential loss cannot yet be estimated. These allegations are substantively similar to claims asserted in the class action and a prior derivative action that was dismissed in June of 2021. RCI intends to vigorously defend against the action. On April 2, 2022, the Company and its current and former officers and directors named in the shareholder derivative complaint filed their Motions to Dismiss and the derivative plaintiffs have responded. The Motions now have been fully briefed for the Court's consideration. Other On June 23, 2014, Mark H. Dupray and Ashlee Dupray filed a lawsuit against Pedro Antonio Panameno and our subsidiary JAI Dining Services (Phoenix) Inc. (“JAI Phoenix”) in the Superior Court of Arizona for Maricopa County. The suit alleged that Mr. Panameno injured Mr. Dupray in a traffic accident after being served alcohol at an establishment operated by JAI Phoenix. The suit alleged that JAI Phoenix was liable under theories of common law dram shop negligence and dram shop negligence per se. After a jury trial proceeded to a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs against both defendants, in April 2017 the Court entered a judgment under which JAI Phoenix’s share of compensatory damages is approximately $ 1.4  million and its share of punitive damages is $ 4  million. In May 2017, JAI Phoenix filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, motion for new trial. The Court denied this motion in August 2017. In September 2017, JAI Phoenix filed a notice of appeal. In June 2018, the matter was heard by the Arizona Court of Appeals. On November 15, 2018 the Court of Appeals vacated the jury’s verdict and remanded the case to the trial court. It is anticipated that a new trial will occur at some point in the future. JAI Phoenix will continue to vigorously defend itself. As set forth in the risk factors as disclosed in this report, the adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. While we take steps to ensure that our adult entertainers are deemed independent contractors, from time to time, we are named in lawsuits related to the alleged misclassification of entertainers. Claims are brought under both federal and where applicable, state law. Based on the industry standard, the manner in which the independent contractor entertainers are treated at the clubs, and the entertainer license agreements governing the entertainer’s work at the clubs, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit. Lawsuits are handled by attorneys with an expertise in the relevant law and are defended vigorously. 18 Table of Contents RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) General In the regular course of business affairs and operations, we are subject to possible loss contingencies arising from third-party litigation and federal, state, and local environmental, labor, health and safety laws and regulations. We assess the probability that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. Our assessments are made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability on the part of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In certain cases that are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability. In matters where there is insurance coverage, in the event we incur any liability, we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of our insurance coverage. Settlements of lawsuits for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amount to approximately $ 0
and $ 192,000 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company has accrued $ 115,000
and $ 246,000
in accrued liabilities, respectively, related to settlement of lawsuits. 19 Table of Contents RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 11.
Segment Information The Company owns and operates adult nightclubs and Bombshells Restaurants and Bars. The Company has identified such segments based on management responsibility and the nature of the Company’s products, services and costs. There are no major distinctions in geographical areas served as all operations are in the United States. The Company measures segment profit (loss) as income (loss) from operations. Segment assets are those assets controlled by each reportable segment. The Other category below includes our media and energy drink divisions that are not significant to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Below is the financial information related to the Company’s segments (in thousands):

million and $ 231,000 , respectively, and intercompany sales of Robust Energy Drink included in Other segment amounting to $ 37,000 . Excluded from revenues in the table above are intercompany rental revenues of the Nightclubs and Corporate segments for the three months ended December 31, 2021 amounting to $ 3.2
million and $ 168,000 , respectively, and intercompany sales of Robust Energy Drink included in Other segment amounting to $ 69,000 . These intercompany revenue amounts are eliminated upon consolidation. General corporate expenses include corporate salaries, health insurance and social security taxes for officers, legal, accounting and information technology employees, corporate taxes and insurance, legal and accounting fees, depreciation and other corporate costs such as automobile and travel costs. Management considers these to be non-allocable costs for segment purposes. Certain real estate assets previously wholly assigned to Bombshells have been subdivided and allocated to other future development or investment projects. Accordingly, those asset costs have been transferred out of the Bombshells segment. 12.
Related Party Transactions Presently, our Chairman and President, Eric Langan, personally guarantees all of the commercial bank indebtedness of the Company.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this quarterly report, and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. Overview RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (“RCIHH”) is a holding company. Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of activities in the hospitality and related businesses. All services and management operations are conducted by subsidiaries of RCIHH, including RCI Management Services, Inc. Through our subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2022, we operated a total of 64 establishments that offer live adult entertainment and/or restaurant and bar operations, including one food hall. We also operated a leading business communications company serving the multi-billion-dollar adult nightclubs industry. We have two principal reportable segments: Nightclubs and Bombshells. We combine operating segments not included in Nightclubs and Bombshells into “Other.” In the context of club and restaurant/sports bar operations, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms used in this report refer to subsidiaries of RCIHH. RCIHH was incorporated in the State of Texas in 1994. Our corporate offices are located in Houston, Texas. Current Operating Environment Our fiscal 2020 was the period hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic causing a significant reduction in customer traffic in our clubs and restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as social distancing practices, dining room closures and other restrictions were mandated or encouraged by federal, state and local governments. In fiscal 2021, our businesses started to recover from the initial effects of the pandemic when government restrictions eased. Stimulus money also flowed to the economy at that time which prompted increased discretionary spending. In fiscal 2022, several coronavirus variants threatened to bring back tight restrictions. Along with the pandemic, geopolitical and macroeconomic events started to affect the U.S. economy in general, with global inflation and supply chain disruptions impacting our businesses. Geopolitical and macroeconomic events are still developing. In the event global inflation leads to a major economic downturn, our business operations and cash flow could be significantly affected. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These estimates are based on management’s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a description of the accounting policies that, in management’s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could, if different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on December 14, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no significant changes in our accounting policies and estimates. Results of Operations Highlights of the Company's first quarter 2023 operating results are as follows: • Total revenues were approximately $70.0 million compared to $61.8 million during the comparable prior-year period, a 13.2% increase (Nightclubs revenue of $56.3 million compared to $46.8 million, a 20.4% increase; and Bombshells revenue of $13.4 million compared to $14.8 million, a 9.1% decrease) • Consolidated same-store sales decreased by 2.7% (Nightclubs increased by 1.2% while Bombshells decreased by 13.9%) (refer to the definition of same-store sales in the discussion of revenues below) 23 Table of Contents • Basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.11 compared to $1.12 (non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $1.19 compared to $1.10) during the comparable prior-year period • Net cash provided by operating activities of $14.9 million compared to $16.3 million during the comparable prior-year period, a 8.4% decrease (free cash flow* of $13.0 million compared to $15.3 million, a 14.6% decrease) * Reconciliation and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures are included in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below. The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Better (Worse) Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Amount % Revenues Sales of alcoholic beverages $ 29,650  42.4  % $ 26,431  42.7  % $ 3,219  12.2  % Sales of food and merchandise 10,347  14.8  % 10,894  17.6  % (547) (5.0) % Service revenues 25,563  36.5  % 20,876  33.8  % 4,687  22.5  % Other 4,408  6.3  % 3,635  5.9  % 773  21.3  % Total revenues 69,968  100.0  % 61,836  100.0  % 8,132  13.2  % Operating expenses Cost of goods sold Alcoholic beverages sold 5,374  18.1  % 4,834  18.3  % (540) (11.2) % Food and merchandise sold 3,586  34.7  % 3,957  36.3  % 371  9.4  % Service and other 49  0.2  % 100  0.4  % 51  51.0  % Total cost of goods sold (exclusive of items shown separately below) 9,009  12.9  % 8,891  14.4  % (118) (1.3) % Salaries and wages 18,676  26.7  % 16,505  26.7  % (2,171) (13.2) % Selling, general and administrative 22,732  32.5  % 18,486  29.9  % (4,246) (23.0) % Depreciation and amortization 3,307  4.7  % 2,194  3.5  % (1,113) (50.7) % Other gains, net (654) (0.9) % (151) (0.2) % 503  333.1  % Total operating expenses 53,070  75.8  % 45,925  74.3  % (7,145) (15.6) % Income from operations 16,898  24.2  % 15,911  25.7  % 987  6.2  % Other income (expenses) Interest expense (3,687) (5.3) % (2,604) (4.2) % (1,083) (41.6) % Interest income 91  0.1  % 106  0.2  % (15) (14.2) % Non-operating gains, net —  —  % 84  0.1  % (84) (100.0) % Income before income taxes 13,302  19.0  % 13,497  21.8  % (195) (1.4) % Income tax expense 3,031  4.3  % 2,933  4.7  % (98) (3.3) % Net income $ 10,271  14.7  % $ 10,564  17.1  % $ (293) (2.8) % * Percentages may not foot due to rounding. Percentage of revenue for individual cost of goods sold items pertains to their respective revenue line. Revenues Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased by approximately $8.1 million, or 13.2%, versus the comparable prior-year quarter due primarily to a 15.4% increase in sales from newly acquired clubs and a new Bombshells opening partially offset by a 2.3% decrease, which is the impact of consolidated same-store sales on total consolidated revenue change. Consolidated same-store sales decreased by 2.7%. We calculate same-store sales by comparing year-over-year revenues from nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars starting in the first full quarter of operations after at least 12 full months for Nightclubs and at least 18 full months for Bombshells.
24 Table of Contents We consider the first six months of operations of a Bombshells unit to be the “honeymoon period” where sales are significantly higher than normal. We exclude from a particular month’s calculation units previously included in the same-store sales base that have closed temporarily until its next full quarter of operations. We also exclude from the same-store sales base units that are being reconcepted or are closed due to renovations or remodels. Acquired units are included in the same-store sales calculation as long as they qualify based on the definition stated above. Revenues outside of our Nightclubs and Bombshells reportable segments are excluded from same-store sales calculation. Segment contribution to total revenues was as follows (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Nightclubs $ 56,325  $ 46,781  Bombshells 13,431  14,771  Other 212  284  $ 69,968  $ 61,836  Nightclubs revenues increased by 20.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to the contribution of newly acquired clubs and the impact of the increase in same-store sales. For Nightclubs that were open enough days to qualify for same-store sales (refer to the definition of same-store sales in the preceding paragraph), sales increased by 1.2%. Newly acquired clubs contributed a sales increase of $9.0 million to the total Nightclubs revenue increase of $9.5 million. By type of revenue, service revenue increased by 23.4%, alcoholic beverage sales increased by 21.6%, and food, merchandise and other revenue increased by 9.6%. Bombshells revenues decreased by 9.1%, of which 13.9% was for same-store sales decrease with the offsetting increase caused by one new location and revenue from franchising operations. By type of revenue, food and merchandise sales decreased by 8.8% while alcoholic beverage sales decreased by 8.6%. Management believes that the decrease in total Bombshells revenue was mainly from higher customer spending in the prior year caused by government stimulus money. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, increased to 75.8% from 74.3% from last year’s first quarter, with a $7.1 million increase, or 15.6%, which was mainly caused by costs and expenses directly related to higher sales in the current-year quarter and stock-based compensation in the current quarter. Significant contributors to the changes in operating expenses are explained below. Cost of goods sold . Cost of goods sold increased by $118,000, or 1.3%, mainly due to higher sales. As a percent of total revenues, cost of goods sold decreased to 12.9% from 14.4% mainly due to the sales mix increases in service and alcohol sales and a decrease in food and merchandise sales. Service revenue has the highest margin while food and merchandise have the lowest. Nightclubs cost of goods sold decreased to 10.5% from 11.1%, while Bombshells cost of goods sold decreased to 22.9% from 24.4%. Salaries and wages . Salaries and wages increased by $2.2 million, or 13.2%, due to increase in personnel from newly acquired clubs and new Bombshells opened in the prior year and shifts to accommodate the increase in sales. As a percent of total revenues, salaries and wages were almost flat at 26.7% from 26.7%. Nightclubs increased to 20.8% from 20.5% and Bombshells increased to 26.5% from 24.8%, while corporate decreased to 4.7% from 5.0%. Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million, or 23.0%, primarily due to increased variable expenses related to higher sales during the current-year quarter and stock-based compensation. 25 Table of Contents For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Better (Worse) Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Amount % Taxes and permits $ 2,684  3.8  % $ 2,236  3.6  % $ (448) (20.0) % Advertising and marketing 2,670  3.8  % 2,383  3.9  % (287) (12.0) % Supplies and services 2,424  3.5  % 1,980  3.2  % (444) (22.4) % Insurance 2,582  3.7  % 2,395  3.9  % (187) (7.8) % Legal 985  1.4  % 1,060  1.7  % 75  7.1  % Lease 1,762  2.5  % 1,640  2.7  % (122) (7.4) % Charge card fees 1,897  2.7  % 1,331  2.2  % (566) (42.5) % Utilities 1,271  1.8  % 935  1.5  % (336) (35.9) % Security 1,164  1.7  % 1,087  1.8  % (77) (7.1) % Stock-based compensation 941  1.3  % —  —  % (941) (100.0) % Accounting and professional fees 1,518  2.2  % 1,346  2.2  % (172) (12.8) % Repairs and maintenance 1,164  1.7  % 725  1.2  % (439) (60.6) % Other 1,670  2.4  % 1,368  2.2  % (302) (22.1) % Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 22,732  32.5  % $ 18,486  29.9  % $ (4,246) (23.0) % Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization increased by $1.1 million, or 50.7%, due to new depreciable assets from newly acquired and constructed units and amortization of SOB licenses from leased clubs. Other gains, net . Other gains, net increased due to a higher gain from disposal of assets and businesses and the settlement of lawsuits in the prior-year quarter. Income (Loss) from Operations For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our consolidated operating margin was 24.2% and 25.7%, respectively. The main drivers for the decrease in operating margin are the stock-based compensation and amortization of SOB licenses which are both only present in the current-year quarter partially offset by fixed expenses leveraged from higher sales. Segment contribution to income (loss) from operations is presented in the table below (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Nightclubs $ 22,740  $ 18,736  Bombshells 1,847  2,802  Other (185) (43) Corporate (7,504) (5,584) $ 16,898  $ 15,911  Nightclubs operating margin was 40.4% and 40.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, while operating margin for Bombshells was 13.8% and 19.0%, respectively. Nightclubs operating margin increased due to fixed expenses leveraged from higher sales, partially offset by amortization of SOB licenses. The decrease in Bombshells operating margin was mainly due to fixed expenses deleveraged from lower sales. 26 Table of Contents Excluding certain items, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin are computed in the tables below (dollars in thousands).

Our total occupancy costs, defined as the sum of operating lease expense and interest expense, were $5.4 million and $4.2 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a percentage of revenue, total occupancy costs were 7.8% and 6.9% during the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily due to the interest from higher average debt balance. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $3.0 million and $2.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax expense rate was 22.8% and 21.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022
27 Table of Contents and 2021, respectively. Our effective income tax rate is affected by state taxes, permanent differences, and tax credits, including the FICA tip credit, for both years, as presented below. For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Federal statutory income tax expense 21.0  % 21.0  % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 4.0  % 2.9  % Permanent differences 0.5  % 0.4  % Tax credit (2.8) % (2.0) % Other 0.1  % (0.6) % Total income tax expense 22.8  % 21.7  % Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor non-GAAP financial measures because it describes the operating performance of the Company and helps management and investors gauge our ability to generate cash flow, excluding (or including) some items that management believes are not representative of the ongoing business operations of the Company, but are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Relative to each of the non-GAAP financial measures, we further set forth our rationale as follows: Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin.
We calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin by excluding the following items from income from operations and operating margin: (a) amortization of intangibles, (b) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (c) gains or losses on insurance, (d) settlement of lawsuits, and (e) stock-based compensation. We believe that excluding these items assists investors in evaluating period-over-period changes in our operating income and operating margin without the impact of items that are not a result of our day-to-day business and operations. Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share . We calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share by excluding or including certain items to net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders and diluted earnings per share. Adjustment items are: (a) amortization of intangibles, (b) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (c) gains or losses on insurance, (d) unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, (e) settlement of lawsuits, (f) gain on debt extinguishment, (g) stock-based compensation, and (h) the income tax effect of the above-described adjustments. Included in the income tax effect of the above adjustments is the net effect of the non-GAAP provision for income taxes, calculated at 22.7% and 22.3% effective tax rate of the pre-tax non-GAAP income before taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the GAAP income tax expense (benefit). We believe that excluding and including such items help management and investors better understand our operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA . We calculate adjusted EBITDA by excluding the following items from net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders: (a) depreciation and amortization, (b) income tax expense (benefit), (c) net interest expense, (d) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (e) gains or losses on insurance, (f) unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, (g) settlement of lawsuits, (h) gain on debt extinguishment, and (i) stock-based compensation. We believe that adjusting for such items helps management and investors better understand our operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal, state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions. The results are, therefore, without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed. We use adjusted EBITDA as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments. Adjusted EBITDA is also the target benchmark for our acquisitions of nightclubs. We also use certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for further discussion. 28 Table of Contents The following tables present our non-GAAP performance measures for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except per share, number of shares and percentages): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA Net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders $ 10,238  $ 10,575  Income tax expense 3,031  2,933  Interest expense, net 3,596  2,498  Settlement of lawsuits —  192  Gain on sale of businesses and assets (590) (342) Gain on debt extinguishment —  (85) Unrealized loss on equity securities —  1  Gain on insurance (64) (1) Stock-based compensation 941  —  Depreciation and amortization 3,307  2,194  Adjusted EBITDA $ 20,459  $ 17,965  Reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income Net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders $ 10,238  $ 10,575  Amortization of intangibles 695  50  Settlement of lawsuits —  192  Gain on sale of businesses and assets (590) (342) Gain on debt extinguishment —  (85) Unrealized loss on equity securities —  1  Gain on insurance (64) (1) Stock-based compensation 941  —  Net income tax effect (200) (38) 29 Table of Contents Non-GAAP net income $ 11,020  $ 10,352  Reconciliation of GAAP diluted earnings per share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share Diluted shares 9,230,258  9,407,519  GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 1.11  $ 1.12  Amortization of intangibles 0.08  0.01  Settlement of lawsuits 0.00  0.02  Gain on sale of businesses and assets (0.06) (0.04) Gain on debt extinguishment 0.00  (0.01) Unrealized loss on equity securities 0.00  0.00  Gain on insurance (0.01) 0.00  Stock-based compensation 0.10  0.00  Net income tax effect (0.02) 0.00  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 1.19  $ 1.10  Reconciliation of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income Income from operations $ 16,898  $ 15,911  Amortization of intangibles 695  50  Settlement of lawsuits —  192  Gain on sale of businesses and assets (590) (342) Gain on insurance (64) (1) Stock-based compensation 941  —  Non-GAAP operating income $ 17,880  $ 15,810  Reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin Income from operations 24.2  % 25.7  % Amortization of intangibles 1.0  % 0.1  % Settlement of lawsuits 0.0  % 0.3  % Gain on sale of businesses and assets (0.8) % (0.6) % Gain on insurance (0.1) % 0.0  % Stock-based compensation 1.3  % 0.0  % Non-GAAP operating margin 25.6  % 25.6  %

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $34.1 million compared to $36.0 million at September 30, 2022. Because of the large volume of cash we handle, we have very stringent cash controls. As of December 31, 2022, we had working capital of $12.8 million compared to working capital of $18.6 million as of September 30, 2022, excluding net assets held for sale amounting to $0 and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Since the pandemic hard hit fiscal 2020, we have since recovered and have seen a more normal stream of operations in 2021 and 2022. Geopolitical and macroeconomic events are still developing. In the event global inflation leads to a major economic downturn, our business operations and cash flow could be significantly affected. We believe that we can borrow capital if needed but currently we do not have unused credit facilities so there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms. 30 Table of Contents We have not recently raised capital through the issuance of equity securities although we have used equity recently in one of our acquisitions. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on stockholders’ equity. We have a history of borrowing funds in private transactions and from sellers in acquisition transactions and have secured traditional bank financing on our new development projects and refinancing of our existing notes payable, but there can be no assurance that any of these financing options would be presently available on favorable terms, if at all. We also have historically utilized these cash flows to invest in property and equipment, adult nightclubs, and restaurants/sports bars. We expect to generate adequate cash flows from operations for the next 12 months from the issuance of this report. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Operating activities $ 14,895  $ 16,264  Investing activities (13,650) (48,130) Financing activities (3,117) 14,134  Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,872) $ (17,732) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Following are our summarized cash flows from operating activities (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net income $ 10,271  $ 10,564  Depreciation and amortization 3,307  2,194  Stock-based compensation 941  —  Gain on debt extinguishment —  (83) Net change in operating assets and liabilities 263  3,414  Other 113  175  Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,895  $ 16,264  Net cash provided by operating activities decreased from year to year primarily due to higher interest expense.

Maintenance capital expenditures refer mainly to capitalized replacement of productive assets in already existing locations. Variances in capital expenditures are primarily due to the number and timing of new, remodeled, or reconcepted locations under construction. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Following are our cash flows from financing activities (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Proceeds from debt obligations $ 1,500  $ 17,002  Payments on debt obligations (3,361) (2,488) Purchase of treasury stock (98) —  Payment of dividends (462) (380) Payment of loan origination costs (96) —  Share in return of investment by noncontrolling partner (600) —  Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,117) $ 14,134  We purchased 1,500 shares of our common stock at an average price of $65.02 during the three months ended December 31, 2022, while we purchased 74,659 shares of our common stock at an average price of $24.03 during the three months ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $18.8 million authorization remaining to purchase additional shares. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.05 per share in the current, while we paid $0.04 per share in the prior-year quarter. See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for future maturities of our debt obligations. Management also uses certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures. We use free cash flow as the baseline for the implementation of our capital allocation strategy. Below is a table reconciling free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP measure (in thousands): For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,895  $ 16,264  Less: Maintenance capital expenditures 1,864  998  Free cash flow $ 13,031  $ 15,266  Our free cash flow for the current quarter decreased by 14.6% compared to the comparable prior-year period primarily due to higher interest expense payments and higher maintenance capital expenditures from renovations of several of our clubs. 32 Table of Contents We do not include capital expenditures related to new facilities construction, equipment and intangibles assets as a reduction from net cash flow from operating activities to arrive at free cash flow. This is because, based on our capital allocation strategy, acquisitions and development of our own clubs and restaurants are our primary uses of free cash flow. Other than the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the current geopolitical and macroeconomic events happening globally, and the notes payable financing described above, we are not aware of any event or trend that would adversely impact our liquidity. In our opinion, working capital is not a true indicator of our financial status. Typically, businesses in our industry carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because businesses in our industry receive substantially immediate payment for sales, with nominal receivables, while inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms. Vendors and purveyors often remain flexible with payment terms, providing businesses in our industry with opportunities to adjust to short-term business downturns. We consider the primary indicators of financial status to be the long-term trend of revenue growth, the mix of sales revenues, overall cash flow, profitability from operations and the level of long-term debt. The following table presents a summary of such indicators for the three months ended December 31 (in thousands, except percentages): 2022 Increase
(Decrease) 2021 Increase
(Decrease) 2020 Sales of alcoholic beverages $ 29,650  12.2  % $ 26,431  52.3  % $ 17,360  Sales of food and merchandise 10,347  (5.0) % 10,894  26.5  % 8,609  Service revenues 25,563  22.5  % 20,876  107.5  % 10,060  Other 4,408  21.3  % 3,635  53.4  % 2,369  Total revenues $ 69,968  13.2  % $ 61,836  61.0  % $ 38,398  Net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders $ 10,238  (3.2) % $ 10,575  9.7  % $ 9,643  Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,895  (8.4) % $ 16,264  159.2  % $ 6,274  Adjusted EBITDA* $ 20,459  13.9  % $ 17,965  106.7  % $ 8,690  Free cash flow* $ 13,031  (14.6) % $ 15,266  169.3  % $ 5,669  Debt (end of period) $ 211,234  30.5  % $ 161,850  20.0  % $ 134,821  * See definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow above in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures subsection of Results of Operations. Impact of Inflation To the extent permitted by competition, we have managed to recover increased costs through price increases and may continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Seasonality Our nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September (our fiscal third and fourth quarters) with the strongest operating results occurring during October through March (our fiscal first and second quarters). Our revenues in certain markets are also affected by sporting events that cause unusual changes in sales from year to year. Capital Allocation Strategy Our capital allocation strategy provides us with disciplined guidelines on how we should use our free cash flows; provided however, that we may deviate from this strategy if other strategic rationale warrants. We calculate free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities minus maintenance capital expenditures. Using the after-tax yield of buying our own stock as baseline, management believes that we are able to make better investment decisions. Based on our current capital allocation strategy: • We consider acquiring or developing our own clubs or restaurants that we believe have the potential to provide a minimum cash on cash return of 25%-33%, absent an otherwise strategic rationale; 33 Table of Contents • We consider disposing of underperforming units to free up capital for more productive use; • We consider buying back our own stock if the after-tax yield on free cash flow is above 10%; • We consider paying down our most expensive debt if it makes sense on a tax adjusted basis, or there is an otherwise strategic rationale. Growth Strategy We believe that we can continue to grow organically and through careful entry into markets with high growth potential. Our growth strategy includes acquiring existing units, opening new units after market analysis, developing new club concepts that are consistent with our management and marketing skills, franchising our Bombshells brand, and developing and opening our Bombshells concept as our capital and manpower allow. All eleven of the existing Bombshells as of December 31, 2022 were located in Texas. Our growth strategy is to diversify our operations with these units which do not require SOB licenses, which are sometimes difficult to obtain. While we are searching for adult nightclubs to acquire, we are able to also search for restaurant/sports bar locations that are consistent with our income targets. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new nightclubs and anticipate acquiring new locations that fit our business model as we have done in the past. The acquisition of additional clubs may require us to take on additional debt or issue our common stock, or both. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise. An inability to obtain such additional financing could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As of December 31, 2022, there were no material changes to the information provided in Item 7A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that the information required to be filed or submitted with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the company with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. This determination is based on the previously reported material weakness management previously identified in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. We are in the process of remediating the material weakness in our internal control, as described below. We believe the completion of these processes should remedy our disclosure controls and procedures. We will continue to monitor this issue. Previously Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In our Annual Report for the year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on December 14, 2022, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2022. In the evaluation, management identified a material weakness in internal control related to the proper design and implementation of controls over management's review of the Company's accounting for business combinations, specifically related to the identification of and accounting for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. 34 Table of Contents Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness Management is committed to the remediation of the material weakness described above, as well as the continued improvement of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As such, we have added controls to enhance management's review of purchase documents to identify intangible assets acquired and controls to increase the precision of the review of all assumptions used in the intangible asset valuation models. We will also conduct senior management reviews of any and all material estimates that are applied in these instances. It is our belief that these actions will effectively remediate the existing material weakness. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than as described above, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
