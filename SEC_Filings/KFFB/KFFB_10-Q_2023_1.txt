NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2022
(unaudited)
The Kentucky First Federal Bancorp (“Kentucky
First” or the “Company”) was incorporated under federal law in March 2005 and is the mid-tier holding company for First
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Hazard, Hazard, Kentucky (“First Federal of Hazard”) and Frankfort First Bancorp,
Inc. (“Frankfort First”). Frankfort First is the holding company for First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky, Frankfort, Kentucky
(“First Federal of Kentucky”). First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky (hereinafter collectively the “Banks”)
are Kentucky First’s primary operations, which consist of operating the Banks as two independent, community-oriented savings institutions.
In December 2012, the Company acquired CKF Bancorp,
Inc., a savings and loan holding company which operated three banking locations in Boyle and Garrard Counties in Kentucky. In accounting
for the transaction, the assets and liabilities of CKF Bancorp were recorded on the books of First Federal of Kentucky in accordance with
accounting standard ASC 805, Business Combinations.
1.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, which represent the condensed consolidated balance sheets and results of operations of the Company, were prepared
in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation
of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. However,
in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair presentation
of the condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three-month and six-month periods
ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for an entire fiscal year. The condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet as of that date. Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K annual report for
2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Principles of Consolidation
- The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, Frankfort First, and its wholly-owned banking subsidiaries, First
Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky (collectively hereinafter “the Banks”). All intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
New Accounting Standards
FASB ASC 326 -
In June 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The
final standard will change estimates for credit losses related to financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans, held-to-maturity
debt securities, and certain other contracts. For estimating credit losses, the FASB is replacing the incurred loss model with an expected
loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The Company will now use forward-looking information
to enhance its credit loss estimates. The amendment requires enhanced disclosures to aid investors and other users of financial statements
to better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting
standards of our portfolio. The largest impact to the Company will be on its allowance for loan and lease losses, although the ASU also
amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, held-to-maturity securities, and purchased financial assets
with credit deterioration. The standard is effective for public companies for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2019. However, the FASB has delayed the implementation of the ASU for smaller reporting companies until years
beginning after December 15, 2022, or in the Company’s case the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2023. ASU 2016-13 will be applied
through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings (modified-retrospective approach), except for debt securities for which an
other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. A prospective transition approach is required for these
debt securities.

Basis of Presentation  (continued)
New Accounting Standards
(continued)
We have selected and engaged a third-party software
provider for modeling our data and plan to test our new system before implementing it. We expect to recognize a one-time cumulative effect
adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective,
but cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time adjustment or the overall impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial
statements. However, the Company does expect ASU 2016-13 to add complexity and costs to its current credit loss evaluation process.
In March 2022 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings
and Vintage Disclosures, as an update to its post-implementation review activities associated with ASU No. 2016-13. The amendments in
this Update eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,
while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing
financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, an entity must apply the loan
refinancing and restructuring guidance provided to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing
loan. This Update also requires disclosure by public business entities of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing
receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measured at Amortized
Cost. Because the Company has not yet adopted amendments in Update 2016-13, the amendments in this Update are effective for the fiscal
year beginning July 1, 2023.
Other accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

We evaluated securities in unrealized loss positions
for evidence of other-than-temporary impairment, considering duration, severity, financial condition of the issuer, our intention to sell
or requirement to sell. Those securities were agency mortgage-backed securities, which carry a very limited amount of risk. Also, we have
no intention to sell nor feel that we will be compelled to sell such securities before maturity. Based on our evaluation, no impairment
has been recognized through earnings.

Loans receivable
Loans that management has the intent and ability
to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal amount outstanding, adjusted for deferred
loan origination costs, net, discounts on purchased loans, and the allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid
principal balance unless the collectability of the loan is in doubt. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are
deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments. Interest income on one- to four-family
residential loans is generally discontinued at the time a loan is 180 days delinquent and on other loans at the time a loan is 90 days
delinquent. All other loans are moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy, typically 90 days after the
loan becomes delinquent. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or
charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days
still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified
impaired loans.
All interest accrued but not received for loans
placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery
method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually
due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable
incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance
is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using
past loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, trends in the level of delinquent and problem loans, adverse situations
that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and current and anticipated economic
conditions in the primary lending area. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available
for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off.
The allowance consists of specific and general
components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard
or doubtful. The general component covers all loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. In consultation
with regulators, the Company considers a time frame of two years when estimating the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses. This
period may be shortened or extended based on anticipated trends in the banks or in the banks’ markets.
The historical loss experience is determined by
portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent eight quarters. This actual
loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment.

These economic factors include consideration of
the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in
volume and terms of loans; changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; experience, ability and depth of lending management
and other relevant staff; economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. Our portfolio
segments include residential real estate, nonresidential real estate and land, loans on deposits and consumer and other loans. Risk factors
associated with our portfolio segments are as follows:
Residential Real Estate
Our primary lending activity is the origination
of mortgage loans, which enable a borrower to purchase or refinance existing homes in the Banks’ respective market areas. We further
classify our residential real estate loans as one- to four-family (owner-occupied vs nonowner-occupied), multi-family or construction.
We believe that our first mortgage position on loans secured by residential real estate presents lower risk than our other loans, with
the exception of loans secured by deposits.
We offer a mix of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate
mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years for owner-occupied properties. For these properties a borrower may be able to borrow up to
97 %
of the value with private mortgage insurance. Alternatively, the borrower may be able to borrow up to
90 % of the value through other programs
offered by the bank.
We offer loans on one- to four-family rental properties
at a maximum of
80 % loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio and we generally charge a slightly higher interest rate on such loans.
We also originate loans to individuals to finance
the construction of residential dwellings for personal use or for use as rental property. We occasionally lend to builders for construction
of speculative or custom residential properties for resale, but on a limited basis. Construction loans are generally less than one year
in length, do not exceed
80 % of the appraised value, and provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase. Funds
are disbursed as progress is made toward completion of the construction.
Multi-family and Nonresidential Loans
We offer mortgage loans secured by residential
multi-family (five or more units), and nonresidential real estate. Nonresidential real estate loans are comprised generally of commercial
office buildings, churches and properties used for other purposes. Generally, these loans are originated for 25 years or less and do not
exceed
80 % of the appraised value. Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve
a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. These loans depend on the borrower’s creditworthiness
and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful
operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment on such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions
in the real estate market or economy than owner-occupied residential loans.

Loans receivable
(continued)
Consumer lending
Our consumer loans include home equity lines of
credit, loans secured by savings deposits, automobile loans, and unsecured loans. Home equity loans are generally second mortgage loans
subordinate only to first mortgages also held by the bank and do not exceed
80 % of the estimated value of the property. We do offer home
equity loans up to
90 % of the estimated value to qualified borrowers and these loans carry a premium interest rate. Loans secured by savings
are originated up to
90 % of the depositor’s savings account balance and bear interest at a rate higher than the rate paid on the
deposit account. Because the deposit account must be pledged as collateral to secure the loan, the inherent risk of this type of loan
is minimal. Loans secured by automobiles are made directly to consumers (there are no relationships with dealers) and are based on the
value of the vehicle and the borrower’s creditworthiness. Vehicle loans present a higher level of risk because of the natural decline
in the value of the property as well as its mobility. Unsecured loans are based entirely on the borrower’s creditworthiness and
present the highest level of risk to the bank.
The Banks choose the most appropriate method for
accounting for impaired loans. For secured loans, which make up the vast majority of the loans in the Banks’ portfolio, this method
involves determining the fair value of the collateral, reduced by estimated selling costs. Where appropriate, the Banks would account
for impaired loans by determining the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current
information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of
the loan agreement. Although most of our loans are secured by collateral, we rely heavily on the capacity of our borrowers to generate
sufficient cash flow to service their debt. As a result, our loans do not become collateral-dependent until there is deterioration in
the borrower’s cash flow and financial condition, which makes it necessary for us to look to the collateral for our sole source
of repayment. Collateral-dependent loans which are more than ninety days delinquent are considered to constitute more than a minimum delay
in repayment and are evaluated for impairment under the policy at that time.
We utilize updated independent appraisals to determine
fair value for collateral-dependent loans, adjusted for estimated selling costs, in determining our specific reserve. In some situations,
management does not secure an updated independent appraisal. These situations may involve small loan amounts or loans that, in management’s
opinion, have an abnormally low loan-to-value ratio.
With respect to the Banks’ investment in
troubled debt restructurings, multi-family and nonresidential loans, and the evaluation of impairment thereof, such loans are nonhomogenous
and, as such, may be deemed to be collateral-dependent when they become more than 90 days delinquent. We obtain updated independent appraisals
in these situations or when we suspect that the previous appraisal may no longer be reflective of the property’s current fair value.
This process varies from loan to loan, borrower to borrower, and also varies based on the nature of the collateral.

Troubled Debt Restructurings:
A Troubled Debt Restructuring (“TDR”)
is the situation where the Bank grants a concession to the borrower that the Banks would not otherwise have considered due to the borrower’s
financial difficulties. All TDRs are considered “impaired.”
In December 2020, Congress amended the CARES Act
through the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2021, which provided additional COVID-19 relief to American families and businesses, including
extending the TDR relief under the CARES Act until the earlier of December 31, 2022 or 60 days following the termination of the national
emergency. The relief can only be applied to modifications for borrowers that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019.
The Company elected to adopt these provisions of the CARES Act. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread economic downturn
that immediately resulted, the Company adopted a loan forbearance plan in which then-current affected borrowers could request deferral
of their loan payments for a period of three months. A total of $ 815,000
in loans were accepted into the plan for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2021. At June 30, 2021 all of those loans had reached the end of their three-month deferral data period and returned to regular
payment status.
At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company
had $ 1.2
million and $ 1.4
million of loans classified as TDRs, respectively. Of the TDRs at December 31, 2022, approximately
16.3 % were
related to the borrower’s completion of Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings with no reaffirmation of the debt to the Banks.
During the six- and three-months ended December
31, 2022, the Company restructured no loans as TDRs. No TDRs defaulted during the six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Credit Quality Indicators:
The Company categorizes loans into risk categories
based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical
payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans
individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on an annual basis. The Company uses the following
definitions for risk ratings:
Special Mention.
Loans classified
as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses
may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.
Substandard.
Loans classified
as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if
any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized
by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful.
Loans classified as
doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Loans not meeting the criteria above that are
analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed that are not rated are
included in groups of homogeneous loans and are evaluated for credit quality based on performing status. See the aging of past due loan
table above. As of December 31, 2022, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is
as follows:

Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets
and Liabilities
ASC topic 820 defines fair value as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (exit price)
at the measurement date. ASC topic 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes six levels of inputs that may be
used to measure fair value:
Level 1
– Quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
– Observable inputs
other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in active markets that are not active;
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities.
Level 3
– Unobservable inputs
that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies
used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Securities
Where quoted market prices are available in an
active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair
values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 2 securities include agency
mortgage-backed securities and agency bonds.
Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring
basis are summarized below:

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies

as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified within Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below.

Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets
and Liabilities  (continued)
At the time a loan is considered impaired, it
is evaluated for loss based on the fair value of collateral securing the loan if the loan is collateral dependent. If a loss is identified,
a specific allocation will be established as part of the allowance for loan losses such that the loan’s net carrying value is at
its estimated fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses.
For collateral-dependent loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation
approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal
process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments
are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate collateral
may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted
based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s
expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are
evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.
There were no loans measured on a nonrecurring basis using the fair
value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans, at December 31, 2022 or at June 30, 2022.
Other Real Estate
Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure
are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted
for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These
appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable
sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the
inputs for determining fair value.
There was no other real estate owned (“OREO”)
written down during the six- or three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. There was no OREO measured on a nonrecurring basis
during the period at fair value less costs to sell at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022.
The following is a disclosure of the fair value
of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, for which it is practicable
to estimate that value. For financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using
present value and other valuation methods.
The methods used are greatly affected by the assumptions
applied, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Therefore, the fair values presented may not represent amounts
that could be realized in an exchange for certain financial instruments.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
Discussion of Financial Condition Changes from
June 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022
Financial Position and Results of Operations
At December 31, 2022 the Company and the Banks
were considered well-capitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements. However, an extended economic recession could
adversely impact the Company’s and the Banks’ capital position and regulatory capital ratios due to a potential increase in
credit losses.
Assets:
At December 31, 2022, the
Company’s assets totaled $335.4 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 2.2%, from total assets at June 30, 2022. This increase
was attributed primarily to increases in loans, net, and investment securities.
Cash and cash equivalents:
Cash
and cash equivalents decreased $18.2 million or 70.4% to $7.7 million at December 31, 2022. Most of the Company’s cash and cash
equivalents are held in interest-bearing demand deposits.
Investment securities:
At December
31, 2022, our securities portfolio, which consisted of mortgage-backed securities, increased $3.0 million or 28.0% and totaled $13.8 million,
compared to June 30, 2022.
Loans :
Loans, net increased
$24.4 million or 8.9% and totaled $299.0 million at December 31, 2022, as a significant amount of residential real estate loans, which
represent the core of the Company’s business were added to the portfolio. One- to four-family, multi-family and construction loans
increased $15.2 million, $5.9 million and $4.3 million from June 30, 2022, respectively. Management continues to look for high-quality
loans to add to its portfolio and will continue to emphasize loan originations to the extent that it is profitable, prudent and consistent
with our interest rate risk strategies.
Non-Performing and Classified Loans:
At
December 31, 2022, the Company had non-performing loans (loans 90 or more days past due or on nonaccrual status) of approximately $6.1
million, or 2.0% of total loans (including acquired loans), compared to $5.8 million or 2.1%, of total loans at June 30, 2022. The Company’s
allowance for loan losses totaled $1.7 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The allowance for
loan losses at December 31, 2022, represented 27.2% of nonperforming loans and 0.6% of total loans (including acquired loans), while at
June 30, 2022, the allowance represented 26.3% of nonperforming loans and 0.6% of total loans.
The Company had $7.5 million in assets classified
as substandard for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2022, and real estate owned (“REO”) of $10,000. Classified loans as
a percentage of total loans (including loans acquired) was 2.5% and 2.7% at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Of substandard
loans, 100.0% were secured by real estate on which the Banks have priority lien position.
The table below shows the aggregate amounts of
our assets classified for regulatory purposes at the dates indicated:

the Company made no loans to facilitate the purchase of its other real estate owned by qualified buyers. Loans to facilitate the sale
of other real estate owned, which were included in substandard loans, totaled $0 and $0 at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
Comparison of Operating Results for the Six-month
Periods Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General
Net income totaled $747,000 or $0.09 diluted earnings
per share for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $303,000 or 28.9% from net income of $1.1 million or $0.13 diluted
earnings per share for the same period in 2021. The decrease in net income on a six-month basis was primarily attributable to lower non-interest
income, increased provision for loan losses, and higher non-interest expense.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income before provision for loan
losses increased $42,000 or 0.9% to $4.9 million for the six-month period just ended. Interest income increased by $261,000, or 4.5%,
to $6.0 million, while interest expense increased $219,000 or 23.9% to $1.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
The increase in interest income period-to-period
was due primarily to an increased average rate earned on interest-earning assets, which increased 27 basis points to 3.77% for the recently-ended
six-month period compared to the prior year period. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $9.7 million or 3.0% to $319.3
million for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Interest income on loans decreased $138,000 or
2.4% to $5.5 million, due primarily to a decrease in the average rate earned on the loan portfolio, which decreased five basis points
to 3.82%, while the average balance decreased $3.5 million or 1.2% to $290.1 million for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022.
Interest income from mortgage-backed securities increased $223,000 $229,000 for the six months just ended due to increases in the average
balance and average rate earned on those assets. The average balance increased $13.5 million to $14.0 million for the period, while the
average rate earned increased 71 basis points to 3.28% for the recently-ended period. Interest income from interest-bearing deposits and
other increased $176,000 to $248,000 for the six months just ended due to an increase in the average rate earned, which increased 2.84%
to 3.25% for the recently-ended period.
Interest expense increased $219,000 or 23.9% to
$1.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased average rate paid on funding sources, which increased
19 basis points to 0.87% for the recently-ended period. Interest expense on borrowings increased $284,000 or 143.4% to $482,000 for the
six-month period just ended compared to the prior year period due chiefly to higher average rates paid on those funds, which increased
1.17% to 1.93%. The average balance of borrowings outstanding decreased $2.5 million or 4.9% to $49.9 million for the recently ended six-month
period. Interest expense on deposits decreased $65,000 or 9.0% to $654,000 for the six months just ended, while the average balance of
deposits decreased $6.6 million or 3.0% to $212.5 million. Interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased $104,000 or 18.4% to
$461,000, for the six months just ended primarily due to a decrease in the average cost, which decreased by 10 bps to 0.79%.
Net interest spread increased from 2.82% for the
prior year semiannual period to 2.90% for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022.
Provision for Losses on Loans
Management determined that a $113,000 provision
for loan loss was appropriate in light of the relatively large increase in the loan portfolio during the period. Loans, net, increased
$24.4 million or 8.9% and totaled $299.0 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $274.6 million at June 30, 2022. The additional provision
was appropriate not only for the increase in the loan portfolio but also, in part, to reflect an increase in multi-family loans, which
increased $5.9 million or 41.2% and totaled $20.1 million at December 31, 2022. Multi-family loans carry a slightly higher risk profile
than 1-4 family residential loans, which makes up the greatest portion of the Company’s loan portfolio.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
Comparison of Operating Results for the Six-month
Periods Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
(continued)
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income decreased $161,000 or 49.1%
to $167,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreased net gains on sales
of loans. Net gain on sales of loans decreased $202,000 to $6,000 for the recently-ended six-month period. Interest rates in the general
market have risen significantly since March 2022, which has resulted in a reduced demand for long-term fixed rate loans. The Company routinely
sells long-term, fixed rate loans to the FHLB of Cincinnati after they are originated.
Non-interest Expense
Non-interest expense increased $83,000 or 2.1%
to $4.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher auditing and accounting costs, as well as higher other
non-interest expenses.
Auditing and accounting costs increased $96,000
or 120.0% to $176,000 for the recently-ended period due increased internal and external audit expenses.
Other non-interest expense increased $41,000 or
14.3% to $327,000 for the semi-annual period just ended due primarily to costs associated with various administrative expenses including
employee training, bank logistics and contributions to aid those who suffered historic flash flooding in our easternmost bank service
area.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense decreased $12,000 or 5.0% to
$229,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period. The effective tax rates for the six-month periods
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were 23.5% and 18.7%, respectively.
33
Kentucky First Federal Bancorp
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three-month
Periods Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General
Net income totaled $374,000 or $0.04 diluted earnings
per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $108,000 or 22.4% from net income of $482,000 or $0.06 diluted earnings
per share for the same period in 2021. The decrease in net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable
to higher non-interest expense, higher income taxes, and lower non-interest income, which were partially offset by increased net interest
income.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased $115,000 or 4.9%
to $2.4 million for the three-month period just ended, as interest income increased at a faster pace than interest expense. Interest income
increased by $350,000, or 12.6%, to $3.1 million, while interest expense increased $235,000 or 52.5% to $683,000 for the three months
ended December 31, 2022.
The increase in interest income period-to-period
was led by an increase in interest income on loans but was strongly supported by increases in interest income on mortgage-backed securities
and interest-bearing deposits and other. Interest income on loans increased $152,000 or 5.5% to $2.9 million for the quarterly period
just ended due to both increased average balance of loans in the portfolio and increased average rate earned. The average balance of loans,
net increased $8.2 million or 2.8% to $297.6 million for the period, while the average balance earned on those assets increased 10 basis
points to 3.89%. Interest income on mortgage-backed securities increased $112,000 to $115,000 for the three months ended December 31,
2022, and was due primarily to an increase in the average balance, which increased $13.6 million to $14.0 million for the quarter just
ended, while the average rate increased 63 basis points to 3.27% for the period. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits and other
increased $86,000 and totaled $121,000 for the quarter just ended due to increased average rate earned on those assets. The average rate
earned increased 3.97% to 4.34%, which was attributed to the rise in short-term interest rates orchestrated by the FOMC during the previous
nine months. The average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased $27.2 million or 70.9% to $11.2 million for the recently-ended
quarter.
The increase in interest expense was attributed
primarily to an increase in interest expense on borrowings, which increased $282,000 to $379,000 for the recently-ended quarterly period.
Interest expense on deposits decreased $47,000 or 13.4% to $304,000 for the period. Interest expense on borrowings was chiefly attributed
to an increase in the average rate, which increased 1.67% to 2.45% for the three months just ended, while the average balance increased
$12.0 million or 24.0% to $62.0 million. Advances were used to replace deposits, whose average balance decreased $14.9 million or 6.8%
to $205.7 million for the three months just ended. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased 5 basis points to 0.59%
for the recently ended period.
Net interest spread increased 13 basis points
from 2.84% for the prior year quarterly period to 2.83% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022.
Provision for Losses on Loans
The Company recorded no provision for loan losses
for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three-month
Periods Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
(continued)
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income decreased $31,000 or 31.0%
to $69,000 for the recently ended quarter due primarily to decreased net gains on sales of loans. Interest rates have risen significantly
since March 2022, which has resulted in a reduced demand for long-term fixed rate loans, which the Company routinely sells to the FHLB
of Cincinnati after they are originated.
Non-interest Expense
Non-interest expense increased $136,000 or 7.2%
to $2.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher employee compensation and benefits, as well as higher
auditing and accounting costs. Employee compensation and benefits costs increased quarter to quarter chiefly due to general salary increases
as well as lower expense in the prior year quarter related to the defined benefit pension plan.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense increased $56,000 to $113,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period. The effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 23.2% and 10.6%, respectively.
