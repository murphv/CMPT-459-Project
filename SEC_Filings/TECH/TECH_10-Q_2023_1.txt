Table of Contents NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Bio-Techne Corporation and Subsidiaries (unaudited) Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: The interim consolidated financial statements of Bio-Techne Corporation and subsidiaries, (the Company) presented here have been prepared by the Company and are unaudited. They have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. They reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022. A summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Company is detailed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022. The Company follows these policies in preparation of the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company operated under
two
operating segments, Protein Sciences and Diagnostics and Genomics. The operating segments the Company operated under were consistent with the Company's operating segments disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022. At the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company held on October 27, 2022, the shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Company’s articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from
100,000,000
to
400,000,000 . On November 1, 2022, the Company’s board of directors approved and declared a
four -for-one split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. Each stockholder of record on November 14, 2022 received
three
additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, which was distributed after close of trading on November 29, 2022. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.
Partially-owned consolidated subsidiary : On September 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its equity shares of Changzhou Eminence Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Eminence) for approximately $ 17.8  million to a third party. Eminence was considered a variable-interest entity that was fully consolidated in our financial statements. Prior to the sale, Eminence had revenue of $ 2.0  million for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 within our Protein Sciences segment. Fiscal 2022 revenues were $ 4.6  million. As a result of the sale of the business, the Company recorded a gain of $ 11.7  million within the Other income (expense) line in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Prior to the sale of Eminence, a triggering event was identified in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and impairment testing was performed as Eminence was forecasted to not have sufficient cash to execute on their growth plan combined with their inability to secure additional financing. Our impairment testing resulted in a full impairment of the Eminence goodwill and intangibles assets for charges of $ 8.3  million and $ 8.6  million, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company also recognized inventory and fixed asset impairment charges of $ 0.9  million and $ 0.9  million, respectively. These impairment charges were recorded within the General and Administrative line in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Eminence was able to secure cash deposits on future orders to provide funding for their operations. This delay in liquidation allowed time for securing of additional investor financing which coincided with the sale of the Company's investment. Investments : In December 2021, the Company paid $ 25
million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to make an initial ownership investment followed by purchase of full equity interest in Wilson Wolf Corporation (Wilson Wolf) if certain annual revenue or EBITDA thresholds are met. Wilson Wolf is a leading manufacturer of cell culture devices, including the G-Rex product line. The first part of the forward contract is triggered upon Wilson Wolf achieving approximately $ 92  million in annual revenue or $ 55  million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) at any point prior to December 31, 2027. Once triggered, the Company is required to make a payment of $ 231
million in exchange for a
19.9 % ownership stake. If Wilson Wolf doesn’t achieve the revenue and EBITDA targets by December 31, 2027, the agreement will expire. Once the first part of the forward contract is triggered, the second part of the forward contract will automatically trigger, and requires the Company to acquire the remaining equity interest in Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027 based on a revenue multiple. The second
4
Table of Contents part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of December 31, 2027, if Wilson Wolf meets its second milestone of approximately $ 226
million in annual revenue or $ 136
million in annual EBITDA. If the second milestone is achieved, the forward contract requires the Company to pay approximately $ 1
billion plus potential consideration for revenue in excess of the revenue milestone. The approximate multiple for total expected payments of the second forward contract is
4.4
times the annual revenue of Wilson Wolf. The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative as detailed under ASC 321-10-35-2 for the Wilson Wolf investment. The Company recorded the $ 25
million payment as a cost basis investment within Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Restructuring actions : Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairments and disposals of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Asset impairment and disposal charges include right of use assets, leasehold improvements, and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets. Fiscal Year 2023 Restructuring Actions: QT Holdings Corporation (Quad) In August 2022, the Company informed employees of our decision to close our QT Holdings Corporation (Quad) facility as part of a realignment of activities within our Reagent Solutions division. The closure of the site is expected to be substantially completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a result of the restructuring activities, an estimated pre-tax charge of $ 2.2  million was recorded within our Protein Sciences segment for the six months ended December 31, 2022. There were
no
additional charges for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022.  The related first quarter of fiscal 2023 restructuring charges were recorded in the income statement as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Employee ​ Asset ​ ​ ​      severance      Impairment and other      Total Selling, general and administrative ​ $

Table of Contents Protein Sciences realignment In December 2022, the Company informed employees it would undertake certain actions to strategically reallocate resources to high growth areas of the business. The realignment impacted a limited number of employees and is expected to be complete in the third fiscal quarter of 2023. As a result, a pre-tax charge of $ 0.8
million related to employee severance was recorded in the Selling, general and administrative line of operating income within our Protein Sciences segment during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents Note 2. Revenue Recognition: Consumables revenues consist of specialized proteins, immunoassays, antibodies, reagents, blood chemistry and blood gas quality controls, and hematology instrument controls that are typically single-use products recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues consist of extended warranty contracts, post contract support, and custom development projects that are recognized over time as either the customers receive and consume the benefits of such services simultaneously or the underlying asset being developed has no alternative use for the Company at contract inception and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the portion of the performance completed. Service revenues also include laboratory services recognized at point in time. Prior to fiscal year 2021, the Company had not recognized revenue upon completion of the performance obligation for laboratory services, but rather upon cash receipt, which was subsequent to the performance obligation being satisfied. The Company accounted for these services based on cash receipts as we did not have significant historical experience collecting payments from Medicare or other insurance providers and considered the variable consideration for such services to be constrained as it would not be probable that a significant amount of revenue would not need to be reversed in future periods for the services provided. Given Medicare coverage for our laboratory services became effective on December 1, 2019, the Company considered it to have sufficient data to estimate variable consideration as of July 1, 2020 for laboratory services that are reimbursed by Medicare. The amount of cash received in fiscal 2021 for laboratory services reimbursed by Medicare that were performed prior to July 1, 2020 was approximately $ 0.5  million. Prior to fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded revenue based on cash receipts for laboratory services not reimbursed by Medicare, as the variable consideration was constrained since we did not have significant historical experience collecting payments not reimbursed by Medicare or other insurance providers and it would not be probable that a significant amount of revenue would not need to be reversed in future periods for the services provided. During the first half of fiscal 2022, we began to see an increase in claim volume due to strategic initiatives, including broader messaging around the importance of cancer screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic subsiding. Given these factors, the Company considered it to have sufficient data to estimate variable consideration as of July 1, 2022 for laboratory services that are not reimbursed by Medicare. The amount of cash received in fiscal 2023 for non-Medicare laboratory services that were performed prior to July 1, 2022 was approximately $ 0.8  million.   We recognize royalty revenues in the period the sales occur using third party evidence. The Company elected the "right to invoice" practical expedient based on the Company's right to invoice a customer at an amount that approximates the value to the customer and the performance completed to date. The Company elected the exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length of one year or less and the exemption to exclude future performance obligations that are accounted under the sales-based or usage-based royalty guidance. The Company’s unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length greater than one year were not material as of December 31, 2022. Contracts with customers that contain instruments may include multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Allocation of the transaction price is determined at the contracts’ inception. Payment terms for shipments to end-users are generally net 30 days. Payment terms for distributor shipments may range from 30 to 90 days. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended warranty and service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g. custom development manufacturing) or a mix of both. Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings. Contract assets are included within other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet as the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional is less than one year. We elected the practical expedient allowing us to expense contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Contract assets as of December 31, 2022 are not material. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenue on warranty contracts. Contract liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were approximately $ 23.5  million and $ 25.5  million, respectively. Contract liabilities as of June 30, 2022
subsequently recognized as revenue during the quarter and  six  month period ended
December 31, 2022 were approximately $ 5.3  million and $ 15.9
million, respectively. Contract liabilities in excess of one year are included in Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 7
Table of Contents Any claims for credit or return of goods must be made within 10 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect estimated credits and returns. Although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions, historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products. We elected the practical expedient that allows us to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost, and we accrue costs of shipping and handling when the related revenue is recognized.

Table of Contents Note 4. Acquisitions: We periodically complete business combinations that align with our business strategy. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and that the results of operations of each acquired business be included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income from their respective dates of acquisitions. Acquisition costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Fiscal year 2023 Acquisitions Namocell, Inc. On July 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the ownership interests of Namocell, Inc. for $ 101.2  million, net of cash acquired, plus contingent consideration of up to $ 25  million upon the achievement of certain future revenue thresholds. The Namocell acquisition adds easy-to-use single cell sorting and dispensing platforms that are gentle to cells and preserve cell viability and integrity. The transaction was accounted for in accordance with ASC  805,   Business Combinations . The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company’s product portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased market penetration. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The business became part of the Protein Sciences operating segment in the first   quarter of fiscal year 2023.   ​ The allocation of purchase consideration related to Namocell, Inc is considered preliminary with provisional amounts primarily related to goodwill, intangible assets, working capital, certain tax-related, and contingent liability amounts. The Company expects to finalize the allocation of purchase price within the one-year measurement-period following the acquisition. Net sales and operating loss of this business included in Bio-Techne's consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2022   were approximately $ 2.2  million and $ 1.6  million, respectively. Net sales and operating loss of this business included in Bio-Techne's consolidated results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022   were approximately $ 4.6  million and $ 3.1
million, respectively. ​ The preliminary estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and as of December 31, 2022   are as follows (in thousands): ​ ​   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Preliminary allocation at acquisition date and at December 31, 2022 Current assets, net of cash $

Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at fair value on the date of close based on management's preliminary assessment. The purchase price allocated to developed technology was based on management’s preliminary forecasted cash inflows and outflows and using a relief from royalty method to calculate the fair value of assets purchased. The purchase price allocated to customer relationships and trade names was based on management's preliminary forecasted cash inflows and outflows and using a multiperiod excess earnings method. The amount recorded for developed technology is being amortized with the expense reflected in cost of goods sold in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for developed technology is estimated to be  13 years . Amortization expense related to customer relationships is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for customer relationships is estimated to be  4 years . The amount recorded for trade names and the non-competition agreement is being amortized with the expense reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for both trade names and the non-competition agreement is estimated to be  3 years . The net deferred income tax liability represents the net amount of the estimated future impact of adjustments for costs to be recognized as intangible asset amortization, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, offset by the deferred tax asset for the preliminary calculation of acquired net operating losses. ​ Note  5 . Fair Value Measurements: The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, available for sale investments, derivative instruments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, contingent consideration obligations, and long-term debt. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. This standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value. This standard maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 may also include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity or a decrease in the observability of market pricing for the investments, such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. ​ 12

Table of Contents Fair value measurements of derivative instruments In October 2018, the Company entered into forward starting swaps designated as cash flow hedges on outstanding debt. The agreement matured in October 2022 and there was no fair value recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022.
The fair value of the designated derivative instrument was  $ 0.5  million, and was recorded within short-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022. In May 2021, the Company entered into a new forward starting swap designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt. The forward starting swap reduces the variability of cash flow payments for the Company by converting the variable interest rate on the Company’s forecasted variable interest long-term debt to that of a fixed interest rate. Accordingly, as part of the forward starting swap, the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between floating and fixed interest amounts based on $ 200  million of notional principal amount. The effective date of the swap was November 2022 with the full swap maturing in November 2025. The fair value of the derivative instrument was $ 15.8  million and $ 11.0  million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, which is recorded within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of the designated hedged instruments are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the corresponding term of the cash flow hedge. The Company reclassified $ 0.6  million to interest income and related tax expense of $ 0.1  million during the six months ended December 31, 2022.  The Company reclassified $ 3.8  million to interest expense and related tax benefits of $ 0.9  million during the six months ended    December 31, 2021 .
The instruments were valued using observable market inputs in active markets and therefore are classified as Level 2 liabilities. Fair value measurements of contingent consideration The Company has $ 7.0  million in contingent consideration recorded as of December 31, 2022, which is the fair value of contingent consideration related to the Asuragen and Namocell acquisitions. The Company is required to make contingent consideration payments of up to $ 105.0  million as part of the Asuragen acquisition agreement and up to $ 25.0  million as part of the Namocell acquisition agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum payout for the Asuragen and Namocell agreements is $ 100.0
million as both Asuragen and Namocell did not achieve their respective December 31, 2022 revenue milestones. ​ The Asuragen contingent agreement is based on achieving certain revenue thresholds by December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The opening balance sheet fair value of the liabilities was $ 18.3  million, which was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation-based model discounted to present value. Assumptions used in these calculations are units sold, expected revenue, expected expenses, discount rate, and various probability factors. The Company reversed an accrual for the fair value of the contingent liabilities associated with the December 31, 2022 threshold during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The contingent consideration related to the December 31, 2023 Asuragen threshold was $ 4.0  million as of December 31, 2022. Contingent consideration was $ 5.0  million as of June 30, 2022. ​ The Namocell contingent agreement is based on achieving certain revenue thresholds by December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The opening balance sheet fair value of the liabilities was $ 10.6  million, which was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation-based model discounted to present value. Assumptions used in these calculations are units sold, expected revenue, expected expenses, discount rate, and various probability factors. The Company reversed an accrual for the fair value of the contingent liabilities associated with the December 31, 2022 threshold during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining contingent consideration related to Namocell was $ 3.0  million. ​ As of December 31, 2022 ,  the Company’s obligation for potential contingent consideration payments related to the B-Mogen acquisition was relieved as there is a remote likelihood that the revenue thresholds and product milestones would be achieved in the timeframe established within the purchase agreement. The Company reversed an accrual for the fair value of the contingent liabilities at the date of settlement during fiscal 2022. ​ The ultimate settlement of contingent consideration liabilities could deviate from current estimates based on the actual results of the financial measures described above. This liability is considered to be a Level 3 financial liability that is re-measured each reporting period. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for these acquisitions is included in general and administrative expense. 14

If market conditions deteriorate, we may incur impairment charges for securities in our investment portfolio. Fair value measurements of other financial instruments
– The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. Cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, and accounts payable – The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. Long-term debt – The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for the amount drawn on our line-of-credit facility and long-term debt approximates fair value because our interest rate is variable and reflects current market rates. ​ Note 6. Debt and Other Financing Arrangements:
On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement). This replaced the revolving line-of-credit and term loan (the prior Credit Agreement), which provided for a revolving credit facility of $ 600.0  million and could be increased by an additional $ 200.0  million subject to certain conditions, and a term loan of $ 250.0  million. The prior Credit Agreement was bearing interest at a variable rate and would have matured on August 1, 2023. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $ 1  billion, which can be increased by an additional $ 400  million subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and expenditures of the Company and its subsidiaries, including financing permitted acquisitions. At the closing on August 31, 2022, the Company borrowed approximately $ 350  million pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement for working capital and for payment of outstanding debt under the Company’s prior credit agreement that was entered into on August 1, 2018. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. The current outstanding debt is based on the one-month Secured Overnight Financing rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined from the total leverage ratio of the Company and updated on a quarterly basis. The annualized fee for any unused portion of the credit facility is currently  10  basis points. The amended and restated Credit Agreement matures on August 1, 2027 and contains customary restrictive and financial covenants and customary events of default. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement was $ 200.0
million. ​ ​ ​ 15
Table of Contents Note 7. Leases: As a lessee, the company leases offices, labs, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 and related standards (collectively ASC 842,
Leases ), which replaced previous lease accounting guidance, on July 1, 2019. The Company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and segment level. We also provide quantitative information about discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with both the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information and related notes included in this Form 10-Q, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. This discussion contains various “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and also contains various “Forward-Looking Statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Forward-Looking Information and Cautionary Statements” located at the end of Item 2 of this report. OVERVIEW Bio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne Corporation (Bio-Techne, we, our, us or the Company) develop, manufacture and sell biotechnology reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological processes and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug discovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses. Consistent with the prior year, we have operated with two segments – our Protein Sciences segment and our Diagnostics and Genomics segment – during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our Protein Sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality purified proteins and reagent solutions, most notably cytokines and growth factors, antibodies, immunoassays, biologically active small molecule compounds, tissue culture reagents and T-Cell activation technologies. This segment also includes protein analysis solutions that offer researchers efficient and streamlined options for automated western blot and multiplexed ELISA workflow. Our Diagnostics and Genomics segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including FDA-regulated controls, calibrators, blood gas and clinical chemistry controls and other reagents for OEM and clinical customers, as well as a portfolio of clinical molecular diagnostic oncology assays, including the ExoDx®Prostate (IntelliScore) test (EPI) for prostate cancer diagnosis. This segment also manufactures and sells advanced tissue-based in-situ hybridization assays (ISH) for research and clinical use. RECENT ACQUISITIONS A key component of the Company's strategy is to augment internal growth of existing businesses with complementary acquisitions.  On July 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Namocell, Inc. for $101.2 million, net of cash acquired, plus contingent consideration of up to $25 million upon the achievement of certain future milestones. The Namocell acquisition adds a leading provider of single cell sorting and dispensing platforms that are gentle to cells and therefore preserve cell viability and integrity.  Refer to Note 4 for additional disclosure regarding the Company's recent acquisitions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operational Update Consolidated net sales increased 1% and 3% for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. Organic growth for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was 4% compared to the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 1% to revenue growth and foreign currency exchange having an unfavorable impact of 4%. Organic growth for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was 5% compared to the prior year same period with acquisitions contributing 1% to revenue growth and foreign currency exchange having an unfavorable impact of 3%. Consolidated net earnings attributable to Bio-Techne decreased to $50.0 million and $139.6 million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to $80.2 million and $149.8 million in the same prior year periods. The decrease in net earnings attributable to Bio-Techne for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to a non-recurring gain of approximately $28.4 million on our ChemoCentryx investment in the prior year. The decrease in net earnings attributable to Bio-Techne for the six months ended December 31, 2022 is due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange, higher inflation, and the Namocell acquisition,

Business Strategy Update Environmental The Company’s key business strategies for long-term growth and profitability continue to be geographic expansion, core product innovation, acquisitions and talent retention and development. As a Company, we are integrating consideration of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental variables into our key business strategies. The Company also strives to innovate and improve all aspects of Bio-Techne’s operations, including reducing the environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations. As described in our Corporate Sustainability report, the Company is currently focused on establishing a baseline for emissions so that we can develop appropriate emission reduction targets, as well as reducing our environmental footprint through changes in packaging and shipping materials. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took additional steps to monitor and strengthen our supply chain to maintain an uninterrupted supply of our critical products and services. The Company has maintained these procedures while incorporating additional considerations regarding potential adverse weather events associated with climate change. The financial impact of potential environmental regulations pertaining to carbon emissions or the integration of climate change impacts into our core business strategies are not expected to materially alter the Company’s near-term financial results. Additionally, the Company has created a cross-functional internal council to monitor and report on its sustainability efforts, including those related to measuring and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Digital In driving our key business strategies, the Company utilizes digital networks and systems for data transmission, transaction processing, and storing of electronic information. As disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of the Company’s Form 10-K, increased cybersecurity attack activity poses a risk for our business. In response to this risk, the Company actively completes system patching and required maintenance, performs internal and third-party employee training, monitors network and system activity, and completes data backups for our systems. However, even with the Company’s procedures performed, our digital networks and systems are still potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks. The financial impact of our cybersecurity initiatives and activities are ongoing and not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. However, the impact on our business operations and financial results from a material cyber breach would be unknown and dependent on the nature of the breach. Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 were $271.6 million and $541.2 million, respectively, an increase of 1% and 3% from the same prior year periods. Organic growth for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was 4% compared to the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 1% to revenue growth and foreign currency exchange having an unfavorable impact of 4%. Organic growth for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was 5% compared to the prior year same period with acquisitions contributing 1% to revenue growth and foreign currency exchange having an unfavorable impact of 3%. Organic growth for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily driven by our Diagnostics and Genomics segment.
Gross Margins Consolidated gross margins for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 were 67.5% and 67.1% respectively, compared to 68.2% and 67.3% for the same prior year periods. Under purchase accounting, inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs, resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold. Excluding the impact of costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, stock compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, and impact of partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted gross margins for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 were 71.7% and 71.3%, respectively compared to 72.3% and 71.8% for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Both consolidated gross margins and non-GAAP adjusted gross margins for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 were impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the same prior year periods. 25

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 8% to $93.0 million and increased 3% to $192.4 million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, from the same prior year periods. The decrease in expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the prior year impairment of assets for Eminence as described in Note 1. The increase in expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the Namocell acquisition and higher inflation, which was partially offset by the Eminence impairment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 9% to $22.5 million and increased 10% to $46.4 million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, from the same prior year periods. The increase in expense was due to the Namocell acquisition, higher inflation, and the timing of strategic growth investments.

Organic growth for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 was 7% and 12%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. Currency exchange had an unfavorable 2% impact for both the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Segment growth was driven by strong execution in consumable and service revenue across the portfolio of the segments products. The operating margin for the segment was 12.2% and 12.3% for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to 16.9% and 14.6% in both comparative prior year periods. The segment’s operating margin was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, higher inflation, and additional investments made in the business to support future growth.
Income Taxes Income taxes were at an effective rate of 24.7% and 17.9% of consolidated earnings for the quarter and six month period ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to 16.4% and 8.2% for the same respective prior year periods. The change in the Company’s tax rate for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 was driven by the composition and amount of net income across periods and the impact of discrete tax items of a $4.6 million expense and a $3.2 million benefit, respectively, compared to prior year discrete tax benefits of $7.6 million and $25.3 million as further discussed in Note 12. The forecasted tax rate as of the second fiscal quarter of 2023 before discrete items is 21.2% compared to the prior year forecasted tax rate before discrete items of 24.6%. Excluding the impact of discrete items, the Company expects the consolidated income tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2023 to range from 21% to 26%. ​ ​ 27

Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments were $196.8 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $247.0 million as of June 30, 2022. Included in the available-for-sale-investments was the fair value of the Company’s investment in exchange traded investment grade bond funds, which was $23.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and $23.9 million as of June 30, 2022. During the first fiscal quarter, the Company sold its remaining shares of its investment in CCXI. As of June 30, 2022, the fair value of the Company’s investment in CCXI was $36.0 million. The Company has a line-of-credit governed by a Credit Agreement dated August 31, 2022 that will mature on August 1, 2027. This Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s previous credit agreement that was entered into on August 1, 2018 and would have matured on August 1, 2023. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Credit Agreement.  The Company has remaining potential contingent consideration payments of up to $100 million  related to the Asuragen and Namocell acquisitions as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of the remaining payments is $7.0 million as of December 31, 2022. During fiscal year 2022, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to purchase the full equity interest in Wilson Wolf Corporation (Wilson Wolf) if certain annual revenue or EBITDA thresholds are met. The Company is currently forecasting the first option payment of $231 million to occur in either fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2024 with the second option payment of approximately $1 billion plus potential contingent consideration occurring between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028. Management of the Company expects to be able to meet its cash and working capital requirements for operations, facility expansion, capital additions, and cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and at least the next 12 months, through currently available cash, cash generated from operations, and remaining credit available on its existing revolving line of credit. Cash Flows From Operating Activities The Company generated cash of $120.5 million from operating activities in the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $149.4  million in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to a reduction of operating income from the prior year combined with unfavorable timing of payments on certain operating liabilities and increases in certain operating assets resulting from the additional steps taken to strengthen our supply chain as discussed within our Business Strategy Update section. Cash Flows From Investing Activities We continue to make investments in our business, including capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for fixed assets for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $15.7 million and $16.2 million, respectively.
Capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately $28 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be financed through currently available funds and cash generated from operating activities. Expected additions in fiscal 2023 are related to increasing capacity to meet expected sales growth across the Company. During the six months ended 2023, the Company acquired Namocell, Inc for $101.2 million, net of cash acquired. There were no acquisitions in the comparative prior year period. During the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company sold its remaining shares in Eminence, its partially-owned consolidated subsidiary, for $17.8 million. There were no sales of businesses in the comparative prior year period. In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company sold its remaining shares in its investment in CCXI for $73.2 million. There were no comparable activities in the first half of 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to purchase the full equity interest in Wilson Wolf Corporation (Wilson Wolf) if certain annual revenue or EBITDA thresholds are met. The Company is currently forecasting the first option payment of $231 million to occur in either fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2024 with the second option payment of approximately $1 billion plus potential contingent consideration occurring between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028. There were no comparable activities in the first half of 2023. ​ 29

Cash of $17.0 million and $56.5 million was received during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from the exercise of stock options. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company made payments of $505.7 million and $109.3 million, respectively, on its long-term debt balance. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed $449.7 million of its line-of-credit facility.

There were no such payments in the comparative fiscal year period.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company's significant accounting policies are discussed in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022  and are incorporated herein by reference. The application of certain of these policies requires judgments and estimates that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the Company. Judgments and estimates are used for, but not limited to, valuation of available-for-sale investments, inventory valuation and allowances, valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and valuation of investments in unconsolidated entities. There have been no significant changes in estimates in the quarter or six months ended December 31, 2022 that would require disclosure nor have there been any changes to the Company's policies. ​ 30
Table of Contents NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” in Item 2, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include: ● Organic Growth ● Adjusted gross margin ● Adjusted operating margin ● Adjusted net earnings ● Adjusted effective tax rate We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP financial measure of organic growth represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months, the impact of foreign currency, as well as the impact of partially owned consolidated subsidiaries. Excluding these measures provides more useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which can vary significantly from period to period, and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period. Revenues from partially owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements are also excluded from our organic revenue calculation, as those revenues are not fully attributable to the Company. There was no revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 due to the sale of Changzhou Eminence Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Eminence) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries was $2.0 million for the  six months ended December 31, 2022. Our non-GAAP financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, exclude stock-based compensation, the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, acquisition related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and other non-recurring items including non-recurring costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and gains. Stock-based compensation is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjection assumptions, variety of award types, and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations. The Company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value contingent consideration, and other non-recurring items including gains or losses on legal settlements, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and one-time assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. Additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity. The Company also excludes revenue and expense attributable to partially owned consolidated subsidiaries in the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures as the revenues and expenses are not fully attributable to the Company. The Company’s non-GAAP adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards, restructuring, impairments of equity method investments, gain and losses from investments, and certain adjustments to income tax expense. Impairments of equity investments are excluded as they are not part of our day-to-day operating decisions. Additionally, gains and losses from other investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded. Costs related to restructuring activities, including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs. The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. In addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported GAAP tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. We believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. 31
Table of Contents The Company periodically reassesses the components of our non-GAAP adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful. Readers are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the Company to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided within the Company's consolidated financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those regarding the Company's expectations as to the effect of changes to accounting policies, the amount of capital expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year, the source of funding for capital expenditure requirements, the sufficiency of currently available funds for meeting the Company's needs, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and expectations regarding gross margin fluctuations, increasing research and development expenses, increasing selling, general and administrative expenses and income tax rates. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the actual results of operations. The following important factors, among others, have affected and, in the future, could affect the Company's actual results: integration of newly acquired businesses, the introduction and acceptance of new products, general national and international economic, political, regulatory, and other conditions, increased competition, the reliance on internal manufacturing and related operations, supply chain challenges, the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations, the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, the impact of governmental regulation, maintenance of intellectual property rights, credit risk and fluctuation in the market value of the Company's investment portfolio, and unseen delays and expenses related to facility construction and improvements. For additional information concerning such factors, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Part II. Item 1A below. ​ 32
Table of Contents ITEM   3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of December 31, 2022, the Company held exchange traded investment grade bond funds, which are included in short-term available-for-sale investments at their fair value of $23.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, the potential loss in fair value due to a 10% decrease in the market value of the exchange traded investment grade bond funds is $2.4 million. The Company operates internationally, and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, approximately 35% of consolidated net sales were made in foreign currencies, including 12% in euros, 4% in British pound sterling, 7% in Chinese yuan and the remaining 12% in other currencies. The Company is exposed to market risk mainly from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro, British pound sterling, the Chinese yuan, and the Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar as the financial position and operating results of the Company's foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation. Month-end average exchange rates between the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar, which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods, to the U.S. dollar were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Quarter Ended
​ Six Months Ended

0.79 ​ The Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables, trade payables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements, but receivable or payable in another currency. The effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2022 levels against the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar are as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Decrease in translation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries (annualized)      $
7,079 Decrease in translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries ​
73,070 Additional transaction losses ​
4,255 ​ ​ ​ ITEM   4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. (b) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting.
