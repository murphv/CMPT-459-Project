Managers Group Commodity Trust I
Notes
to Interim Financial Statements
December
31, 2022 (unaudited)
(1) Organization
ETF
Managers Group Commodity Trust I (the “Trust”) was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on July 23, 2014. The Trust is
a series trust formed pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and currently consists of one
series. BREAKWAVE DRY BULK SHIPPING
ETF (“BDRY,” the “Fund”), is a commodity pool that continuously issues shares of beneficial interest that may
be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The Fund is currently the Trust’s only publicly offered series. However, the second series of the Trust, the Breakwave Tanker Shipping
ETF may be offered in the future. The Fund is managed and controlled by ETF Managers Capital LLC (the “Sponsor”), a
Delaware limited liability company. The Sponsor is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as a
“commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) and is a member of the National Futures Trading Association (“NFA”).
Breakwave Advisors, LLC (“Breakwave”) is registered as a “commodity trading advisor” (“CTA”) with
the CFTC and serves as BDRY’s commodity trading advisor.
BDRY
commenced investment operations on March 22, 2018. BDRY commenced trading on NYSE Arca on March 22, 2018 and trades under the symbol
“BDRY.”
BDRY’s
investment objective is to provide investors with exposure to the daily change in the price of dry bulk freight futures, before expenses
and liabilities of BDRY, by tracking the performance of a portfolio (the “BDRY Benchmark Portfolio”) consisting of a three-month
strip of the nearest calendar quarter of futures contracts on specified indexes (each a “Reference Index”) that measure rates
for shipping dry bulk freight (“Freight Futures”). Each Reference Index is published each United Kingdom business day by
the London-based Baltic Exchange Ltd. (the “Baltic Exchange”) and measures the charter rate for shipping dry bulk freight
in a specific size category of cargo ship – Capesize, Panamax or Supramax. The three Reference Indexes are as follows:
●
Capesize :
the Capesize 5TC Index;
●
Panamax :
the Panamax 4TC Index; and
●
Supramax :
the Supramax 6TC Index.
The
value of the Capesize 5TC Index is disseminated at 11:00 a.m., London Time and the value of the Panamax 4TC Index and the Supramax 6TC
Index each is disseminated at 1:00 p.m., London Time. The Reference Index information disseminated by the Baltic Exchange also includes
the components and value of each component in each Reference Index. Such Reference Index information also is widely disseminated by Reuters
and/or other major market data vendors.
BDRY
seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in the Freight Futures currently constituting
the BDRY Benchmark Portfolio. The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio includes all existing positions to maturity and settles them in cash. During
any given calendar quarter, the BDRY Benchmark Portfolio progressively increases its positions to the next calendar quarter three-month
strip, thus maintaining constant exposure to the Freight Futures market as positions mature.
16
The
BDRY Benchmark Portfolio maintains long-only positions in Freight Futures. The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio includes a combination of Capesize,
Panamax and Supramax Freight Futures. More specifically, the BDRY Benchmark Portfolio includes
50 % exposure in Capesize Freight Futures
contracts,
40 % exposure in Panamax Freight Futures contracts and
10 % exposure in Supramax Freight Futures contracts. The BDRY Benchmark
Portfolio does not include and BDRY does not invest in swaps, non-cleared dry bulk freight forwards or other over-the-counter derivative
instruments that are not cleared through exchanges or clearing houses. BDRY may hold exchange-traded options on Freight Futures. The
BDRY Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by Breakwave and will be rebalanced annually. The Freight Futures currently constituting the BDRY
Benchmark Portfolio, as well as the daily holdings of BDRY are available on BDRY’s website at www.drybulketf.com.
When
establishing positions in Freight Futures, BDRY will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately
10 % to
40 %
of the notional value of each Freight Futures position at the time it is established. These margin requirements are established and
subject to change from time to time by the relevant exchanges, clearing houses or BDRY’s Futures Commissions Merchant
(“FCM”), Marex Financial (formerly ED&F Man Capital Markets, Inc.). On a daily basis, BDRY is obligated to pay, or
entitled to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Freight Futures
positions. Any assets not required to be posted as margin with the FCM may be held at BDRY’s custodian or remain with the FCM
in cash or cash equivalents, as discussed below.
BDRY
was created to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain exposure to daily changes in the price of Freight Futures.
BDRY is intended to be used as a diversification opportunity as part of a complete portfolio, not a complete investment program.
The
Fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations. The Fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries
or other high credit quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the Freight futures
and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses and income from the
cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”)
and changes in the Benchmark Portfolio, because the Benchmark Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income.
The
Fund seeks to trade its positions prior to maturity; accordingly, natural market forces may cost the Fund while rebalancing. Each time
the Fund seeks to reconstitute its positions, barring movement in the underlying securities, the futures and option prices may be higher
or lower. Such differences in price, barring a movement in the price of the underlying security, will constitute “roll yield”
and may inhibit the Fund’s ability to achieve its respective investment objective.
Several
factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position. One factor that impacts the total return that will
result from investing in near month futures contracts and “rolling” those contracts forward each month is the price relationship
between the current near month contract and the next month contract.
The
CTA will close existing positions when it determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvest the proceeds in other positions. Positions
may also be closed out to meet orders for redemption baskets.
(2)
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Basis of Accounting
The
accompanying interim financial statements of the Fund have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“U.S. GAAP”). The Fund qualifies as an investment company for financial reporting purposes under Topic 946 of the Accounting
Standard Codification of U.S. GAAP.
The
accompanying interim financial statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, contain all adjustments (which include normal
recurring adjustments) considered necessary to present fairly the interim financial statements. These interim financial statements should
be read in conjunction with BDRY’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 and BDRY’s prospectus dated
March 24, 2022 (the “BDRY Prospectus,”). Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year
period.
17
(b)
Use of Estimates
The
preparation of the interim financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(c)
Cash
Cash,
when shown in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities, represents non-segregated cash with the custodian and does not include short-term
investments.
(d)
Cash Held by Broker
Breakwave
is registered as a “commodity trading advisor” and acts as such for BDRY. The Fund’s arrangement with its FCM requires
the Fund to meet its variation margin requirement related to the price movements, both positive and negative, on futures contracts held
by the Fund by keeping cash on deposit with the Commodity Broker (as defined below). These amounts are shown as Segregated cash held
by broker in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The Fund deposits cash or United States Treasury Obligations, as applicable, with
its FCM subject to the CFTC regulations and various exchange and broker requirements. The combination of the Fund’s deposits with
its FCM of cash and United States Treasury Obligations, as applicable, and the unrealized gain or loss on open futures contracts (variation
margin) represents the Fund’s overall equity in its brokerage trading account. The Fund uses its cash held by its FCM to satisfy
variation margin requirements. The Fund earns interest on its cash deposited with its FCM and interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis.
(e)
Final Net Asset Value for Fiscal Period
The
calculation time of the Fund’s final net asset value for creation and redemption of Fund shares for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 was at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Although
the Fund’s shares may continue to trade on secondary markets subsequent to the calculation of the final NAV, the 4:00 p.m. Eastern
Time represented the final opportunity to transact in creation or redemption baskets for the three and six months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021.
Fair
value per share is determined at the close of the NYSE Arca.
For
financial reporting purposes, the Fund values its investment positions based upon the final closing price in their primary markets. Accordingly,
the investment valuations in these interim financial statements differ from those used in the calculations of the Fund’s final
creation/redemption NAVs at December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
(f)
Investment Valuation
Short-term
investments, excluding U.S. Treasury Bills, are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. U.S. Treasury Bills are valued
as determined by an independent pricing service based on methods which include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; and general market conditions.
Futures
and options contracts are valued at the last settled price on the applicable exchange on which that futures and/or options contract trades.
18
( g)
Financial Instruments and Fair Value
The
Fund discloses the fair value of its investments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) fair
value measurement and disclosure guidance which requires a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value. The disclosure requirements establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant
assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent to the Fund (observable inputs); and (2) the Fund’s
own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable
inputs). The three levels defined by the disclosure requirements hierarchy are as follows:
Level I:
Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level II:
Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II inputs include
the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs
that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
Level III:
Unobservable pricing input
at the measurement date for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable
inputs are not available.
In
some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Fair
value measurements also require additional disclosure when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly
decreased, as well as when circumstances indicate that a transaction is not orderly.
The
following table summarizes BDRY’s valuation of investments at December 31, 2022 and at June 30, 2022 using the fair value hierarchy:

Transfers
between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended June
30, 2022, BDRY recognized no transfers from Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3.
The
inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
19
(h)
Investment Transactions and Related Income
Investment
transactions are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis, and marked to market
daily. Unrealized gain/loss on open futures contracts is reflected in Receivable/Payable on open futures contracts in the Statements
of Assets and Liabilities and the change in the unrealized gain/loss between periods is reflected in the Statements of Operations.
BDRY’s interest earned on short-term securities and on cash deposited with Marex Financial (formerly ED&F Man Capital
Markets, Inc.) is accrued daily and reflected as Interest Income, when applicable, in the Statements of Operations.
(i)
Federal Income Taxes
The
Fund is registered as a Delaware statutory trust and is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the
Fund does not expect to incur U.S. federal income tax liability; rather, each beneficial owner is required to take into account their
allocable share of the Fund’s income, gain, loss, deductions and other items for the Fund’s taxable year ending with or within
the beneficial owner’s taxable year.
Management
of the Fund has reviewed the open tax years and major jurisdictions and concluded that there is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized
tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns at December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022. The Fund is also not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized
tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. On an ongoing basis, management will monitor its tax positions taken
to determine if adjustments to its conclusions are necessary based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation of
guidance expected from the FASB and on-going analysis of tax law, regulation, and interpretations thereof. The Fund’s federal tax
returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years after they are filed.
(3)
Investments
(a)
Short-Term Investments
The
Fund may purchase U.S. Treasury Bills, agency securities, and other high-credit quality short-term fixed income or similar securities
with original maturities of one year or less. A portion of these investments may be used as margin for the Fund’s trading in futures
contracts.
(b)
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
In
seeking to achieve the Fund’s investment objective, the commodity trading advisor uses a mathematical approach to investing. Using
this approach, the commodity trading advisor determines the type, quantity and mix of investment positions that it believes in combination
should produce returns consistent with the Fund’s objective.
All
open derivative positions at December 31, 2022 and at June 30, 2022, as applicable, are disclosed in the Schedules of Investments and
the notional value of these open positions relative to the shareholders’ capital of the Fund is generally representative of the
notional value of open positions to shareholders’ capital throughout the reporting periods for the Fund. The volume associated
with derivative positions varies on a daily basis as the Fund transacts in derivative contracts in order to achieve the appropriate exposure,
as expressed in notional value, in comparison to shareholders’ capital consistent with the Fund’s investment objective.
Following
is a description of the derivative instruments used by the Fund during the reporting period, including the primary underlying risk exposures.
(c)
Futures Contracts
The
Fund enters into futures contracts to gain exposure to changes in the value of the Benchmark Portfolio. A futures contract obligates
the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future cash settlement of a specified quantity and type of a freight futures
contract at a specified time and place. The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller of a freight futures contract may generally
be satisfied by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated
date of delivery.
Upon
entering into a futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit and maintain as collateral at least such initial margin as required
by the exchange on which the transaction is affected. The initial margin is segregated as Cash held by broker, as disclosed in the Statements
of Assets and Liabilities, and is restricted as to its use. Pursuant to the futures contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay
to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses. The Fund will realize a gain or loss upon closing a futures
transaction.
Futures
contracts involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically freight shipping price risk) and exposure to loss in excess
of the amount of variation margin. The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure the Fund has in the particular
classes of instruments. Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts include imperfect correlation between movements
in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for
a futures contract. With futures contracts, there is minimal counterparty risk to the Fund since futures contracts are exchange-traded
and the exchange’s clearinghouse, as counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts, guarantees the futures contracts against
default.

(4)
Agreements
(a)
Management Fee
The
Fund pays the Sponsor a sponsor fee (the “Sponsor Fee”) in consideration of the Sponsor’s advisory services to the
Fund. Additionally, the Fund pays its commodity trading advisor a license and service fee (the “CTA fee”).
BDRY
pays the Sponsor an annual Sponsor Fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount calculated as the greater of
0.15 % of its average daily net
assets, or $ 125,000 . BDRY also pays an annual fee to Breakwave, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to
1.45 % of BDRY’s average
daily net assets. Breakwave has agreed to waive its CTA fee to the extent necessary, and the Sponsor has voluntarily agreed to correspondingly
assume the remaining expenses of BDRY such that Fund expenses do not exceed an annual rate of
3.50 %, excluding brokerage commissions
and interest expense, of the value of BDRY’s average daily net assets through March 31, 2024 (the “BDRY Expense Cap,”).
The assumption of expenses by the Sponsor and waiver of BDRY’s CTA fee are contractual on the part of the Sponsor and Breakwave,
respectively.
The
waiver of BDRY’s CTA fees, pursuant to the undertaking, amounted to $ 38,707
and $-0-, for the three months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, and $ 66,332
and $- 0 - for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements
of Operations.
The
Fund currently accrues its daily expenses up to the Expense Cap, or if less, at accrual estimates established by the Sponsor. At the
end of each month, the accrued amount is remitted to the Sponsor as the Sponsor has assumed, and is responsible for the payment of the
routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund in excess of the Fund’s Expense Cap, which in the case
of BDRY, aggregated $-0- and $-0- for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $-0- and $- 0 - for the
six
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.
(b)
The Administrator, Custodian, Fund Accountant and Transfer Agent
The
Fund has appointed U.S. Bank, a national banking association, with its principal office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the custodian (the
“Custodian”). Its affiliate, U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, is the Fund accountant (“the Fund accountant”) of the
Fund, transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) for Fund shares and administrator for the Fund (the “Administrator”).
It performs certain administrative and accounting services for the Fund and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of the
Fund. (U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Fund Services are referred to collectively hereinafter as “U.S. Bank”).
BDRY
has agreed to pay U.S. Bank
0.05 % of AUM, with a $ 45,000
minimum annual fee payable for its administrative, accounting and transfer agent
services and
0.01 % of AUM, with an annual minimum of $ 4,800
for custody services. BDRY paid U.S. Bank $ 16,637
and $ 16,284
for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 33,274
and $ 32,581
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.
23
(c) The Distributor
The Fund pays ETFMG Financial LLC. (the “Distributor”),
an affiliate of the Sponsor, an annual fee for statutory and wholesaling distribution services and related administrative services equal
to the greater of $ 15,000
or
0.02 % of the Fund’s average daily net assets, payable monthly. Pursuant to the Marketing Agent Agreement
between the Sponsor, the Fund and the Distributor, the Distributor assists the Sponsor and the Fund with certain functions and duties
relating to distribution and marketing services to the Fund, including reviewing and approving marketing materials and certain regulatory
compliance matters. The Distributor also assists with the processing of creation and redemption orders.
BDRY incurred $ 3,959
and $ 3,959
for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 7,918
and $ 7,918
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.
BDRY pays the Sponsor an annual fee for wholesale
support services of $25,000 plus 0.12% of BDRY’s average daily net assets, payable monthly.
BDRY incurred $ 17,422
and $ 30,294
in wholesale
support fees for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 35,122
and $ 64,101
for the six months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.
(d) The Commodity Broker
Marex Financial (formerly ED&F Man Capital
Markets Inc.), registered in England, serves as BDRY’s clearing broker (the “Commodity Broker”). In its capacity as clearing
broker, the Commodity Broker executes and clears the Fund’s futures transactions and performs certain administrative services for
the Fund.
The Fund pays brokerage commissions, including
applicable exchange fees, National Futures Association (“NFA”) fees, give–up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction
related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities in CFTC regulated investments. Brokerage commissions on futures
contracts are recognized on a half-turn basis.
The Sponsor does not expect brokerage commissions
and fees to exceed
0.40 % (excluding the impact on the Fund of creation and/or redemption activity) of the net asset value of the Fund
for execution and clearing services on behalf of the Fund, although the actual amount of brokerage commissions and fees in any year or
any part of any year may be greater. The effects of trading spreads, financing costs associated with financial instruments, and costs
relating to the purchase of U.S. Treasury Securities or similar high credit quality short-term fixed-income or similar securities are
not included in the foregoing analysis. BDRY incurred $ 142,544
and $ 198,545
in brokerage commissions and fees for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 252,166
and $ 376,338
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.
24
(e) The Trustee
Under the Amended and Restated Declaration of
Trust and Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”) for the Fund, Wilmington Trust Company, the Trustee of the Fund (the “Trustee”)
serves as the sole trustee of the Fund in the State of Delaware. The Trustee will accept service of legal process on the Fund in the
State of Delaware and will make certain filings under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. Under the Trust Agreement for the Fund, the Sponsor
has the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Fund. The Trustee does not owe any other duties to the
Fund, the Sponsor or the Shareholders of the Fund. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the
Sponsor, nor does the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Sponsor. BDRY incurred $ 1,260
and $ 630
in trustee fees
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 2,520
and $ 1,260
for the six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, which is included in Other Expenses in the Statements of Operations.
(f) Routine Offering, Operational, Administrative
and Other Ordinary Expenses
The Sponsor, in accordance with the BDRY Expense
Cap limitation paid, after the waiver of the CTA fee for BDRY by Breakwave, if any, all of the routine offering, operational, administrative
and other ordinary expenses of BDRY in excess of
3.50 % (excluding brokerage commissions and interest expense) of BDRY’s average
daily net assets, including, but not limited to, accounting and computer services, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, Administrator,
Custodian, Transfer Agent and Distributor, legal and accounting fees and expenses, tax return preparation expenses, filing fees, and
printing, mailing and duplication costs. BDRY incurred $ 505,629
and $ 955,267
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
and $ 976,903
and $ 1,751,167
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in routine offering, operational, administrative
or other ordinary expenses.
Effective September 1, 2022, Breakwave may recoup
any fees waived on or after such date, pursuant to the Expense Cap; however, no repayment will be made if such repayment causes the Fund’s
Total Expenses after the repayment to exceed either the Expense Cap in place at the time such amounts were waived, or the Fund’s
current Expense Cap. Such recoupment is limited to three years from the date the amount is initially waived.
The CTA fee waiver for BDRY by Breakwave was $ 38,707
and $-0- for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 66,332
and $- 0 - for the six months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively.
In addition, the assumption of Fund expenses above
the BDRY Expense Cap by the Sponsor, pursuant to the undertaking (as discussed in Note 4a), amounted to $-0- and $-0- for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $-0- and $-0- for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
25
(g) Organizational and Offering Costs
Expenses incurred in connection with organizing
BDRY and up to the offering of its Shares upon commencement of its investment operations on March 22, 2018, were paid by the Sponsor and
Breakwave without reimbursement.
Accordingly, all such expenses are not reflected
in the Statements of Operations. The Fund will bear the costs of its continuous offering of Shares and ongoing offering expenses. Such
ongoing offering costs will be included as a portion of the Routine Offering, Operational, Administrative and Other Ordinary Expenses.
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, BDRY incurred no such expenses.
During the year ended June 30, 2021 the Sponsor,
in order to maintain the continuous offering of Shares, undertook to register additional Shares of the Fund, the costs of which were borne
by the Fund and aggregated $ 28,997 , of which $ 28,997
and $ 19,544
was amortized to expense at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Amortization of offering costs amounted to $- 0 - and $ 7,309 , respectively, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and $ 7,309
and $ 14,618
respectively for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021.
(5) Creations and Redemptions
The Fund issues and redeems Shares from time to
time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets. A Creation Basket is a block of
25,000
Shares of the Fund. Baskets may be created or redeemed
only by Authorized Participants.
Except when aggregated in Creation Baskets, the
Shares are not redeemable securities. Retail investors, therefore, generally will not be able to purchase or redeem Shares directly from
or with the Fund. Rather, most retail investors will purchase or sell Shares in the secondary market with the assistance of a broker.
Thus, some of the information contained in these Notes to Interim Financial Statements – such as references to the Transaction Fee
imposed on creations and redemptions – is not relevant to retail investors.
(a) Transaction Fees on Creation and Redemption
Transactions
In connection with orders to create and redeem
one or more Creation Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee, or AP Transaction Fee, of $ 300
per order,
which goes directly to the Custodian. The AP Transaction Fees are paid by the Authorized Participants and not by the Fund.

(6) Risk
(a) Investment Related Risk
The NAV of BDRY’s shares relates directly
to the value of the futures portfolio, cash and cash equivalents held by BDRY. Fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially
adversely affect the value and performance of an investment in BDRY’s shares. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of
future results; all or substantially all of an investment in BDRY could be lost.
The NAV of BDRY’s shares relates directly
to the value of futures investments held by BDRY which are materially impacted by fluctuations in changes in spot charter rates. Charter
rates for dry bulk vessels are volatile and have declined significantly since their historic highs and may remain at low levels or decrease
further in the future.
Futures and options contracts have expiration
dates. Before or upon the expiration of a contract, BDRY may be required to enter into a replacement contract that is priced higher or
that has less favorable terms than the contract being replaced (see “Negative Roll Risk,” below). The Freight Futures market
settles in cash against published indices, so there is no physical delivery against the futures contracts.
Similar to other futures contracts, the Freight
Futures curve shape could be either in “contango” (where the futures curve is upward sloping with the next futures price higher
than the current one) or “backwardation” (where the next futures price is lower than the current one). Contango curves are
generally characterized by negative roll cost, as the expiring contract value is lower that the next prompt contract value, assuming the
same lot size. That means there could be losses incurred when the contracts are rolled each period and such losses are independent of
the Freight Futures price level.
As of late January, the ongoing conflict between
Russia and Ukraine has developed into a war, posing an increasing risk for global economic growth. Major economic sanctions against Russia
are having a considerable impact on oil and gas prices, given the dependence of the EU on oil and gas exports out of Russia combined
with limited spare capacity of such commodities globally. Energy prices have increased significantly, leading to major inflationary pressures
in the major developed countries that rely heavily on oil and gas exports out of Russia. In addition, the combined Russia/Ukraine region
account for approximately one quarter of global grain production, one of the main cargoes transported by dry bulk vessels, while coal
and iron ore exports out of the region have also been reduced. The above factors can have a material negative impact on demand for dry
bulk transportation, while slower economic growth could also negatively affect demand for dry bulk commodities in the rest of the world,
leading to lower dry bulk freight rates.
The recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine
is having a profound impact on global commodities prices including grain and coal, two of the most important commodities for dry bulk
shipping. Given the importance of the region in export volumes for both grains and coal, a prolonged stoppage could lead to significantly
lower freight rates and thus a decline in freight futures prices and a decline in the value of the Fund. Although coal supplies could
potentially be sourced from elsewhere partly mitigating the negative impact of the lost volumes, global grain production capacity is limited,
and thus the impact of the lost volumes could not be easily mitigated. In addition, the recent geopolitical turmoil has led to an increase
in government protectionism when it comes to commodities, and if such a trend continues, it could lead to lower bulk commodities trading
globally over the long term. The impact of such a scenario on dry bulk shipping will be negative, leading to lower spot rates and as a
result lower freight futures prices and a decline in the value of the Fund.
(b) Liquidity Risk
In certain circumstances, such as the disruption
of the orderly markets for the futures contracts or Financial Instruments in which the Fund invests, the Fund might not be able to dispose
of certain holdings quickly or at prices that represent what the market value may have been in an orderly market. Futures and option positions
cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small
volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption can also make it difficult to liquidate a position. The large size of the
positions that the Fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by
potentially increasing losses while trying to do so. Such a situation may prevent the Fund from limiting losses, realizing gains or achieving
a high correlation with the Benchmark Portfolio.
(c) Natural Disaster/Epidemic Risk
Natural or environmental disasters, such as
earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis and other severe weather-related phenomena generally, and widespread disease,
including pandemics and epidemics (for example, the novel coronavirus COVID-19), have been and can be highly disruptive to economies
and markets and have recently led, and may continue to lead, to increased market volatility and significant market losses. Such
natural disaster and health crises could exacerbate political, social, and economic risks previously mentioned, and result in
significant breakdowns, delays, shutdowns, social isolation, and other disruptions to important global, local and regional supply
chains being affected, with potential corresponding results on the operating performance of the Fund and its investments. A climate
of uncertainty and panic, including the contagion of infectious viruses or diseases, may adversely affect global, regional, and
local economies and reduce the availability of potential investment opportunities, and increases the difficulty of performing due
diligence and modeling market conditions, potentially reducing the accuracy of financial projections. Under these circumstances, the
Fund may have difficulty achieving its investment objective which may adversely impact performance. Further, such events can be
highly disruptive to economies and markets, significantly disrupt the operations of individual companies (including, but not limited
to, the Fund’s Sponsor and third party service providers), sectors, industries, markets, securities and commodity exchanges,
currencies, interest and inflation rates, credit ratings, investor sentiment, and other factors affecting the value of the
Fund’s investments. These factors can cause substantial market volatility, exchange trading suspensions and closures and can
impact the ability of the Fund to complete redemptions and otherwise affect Fund performance and Fund trading in the secondary
market. A widespread crisis may also affect the global economy in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen at the present time. How
long such events will last and whether they will continue or recur cannot be predicted. Impacts from these events could have
significant impact on the Fund’s performance, resulting in losses to the Fund.
28
(d) Risk that Current Assumptions and Expectations
Could Become Outdated as a result of Global Economic Shocks
The onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
has caused significant shocks to global financial markets and economies, with many governments taking extreme actions to slow and contain
the spread of COVID-19. These actions have had, and likely will continue to have, a severe economic impact on global economies as economic
activity in some instances has essentially ceased at times. Financial markets across the globe have experienced, and may continue to experience,
severe distress at least equal to what was experienced during the global financial crisis in 2008.
The global economic shocks being experienced as
of the date hereof may cause the underlying assumptions and expectations of the Fund to become outdated quickly or inaccurate, resulting
in significant losses.
(7) Profit and Loss Allocations and Distributions
Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, income and expenses
are allocated
pro rata
among the Shareholders monthly based on their respective percentage interests as of the close of the last
trading day of the preceding month. Any losses allocated to the Sponsor which are in excess of the Sponsor’s capital balance are
allocated to the Shareholders in accordance with their respective interest in the Fund as a percentage of total Shareholders’ capital.
Distributions (other than redemption of units) may be made at the sole discretion of the Sponsor on a
pro rata
basis in accordance
with the respective interests of the Shareholders.
(8) Indemnifications
The Sponsor, either in its own capacity or in
its capacity as the Sponsor and on behalf of the Fund, has entered into various service agreements that contain a variety of representations,
or provide indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best
interests of the Fund. As of December 31, 2022, the Fund had not received any claims or incurred any losses pursuant to these agreements
and expects the risk of such losses to be remote.
(9) Termination
The term of the Fund is perpetual unless terminated
earlier in certain circumstances as described in the Prospectus.
(10)
Net Asset Value and Financial Highlights
The Fund is presenting the following net asset
value and financial highlights related to investment performance for a BDRY Share outstanding throughout the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The net investment income and total expense ratios are calculated using average
net assets. The net asset value presentation is calculated by dividing the Fund’s net assets by the average daily number of Shares
outstanding. The net investment income (loss) and expense ratios have been annualized. The total return is based on the change in net
asset value and market value of the Shares during the period. An individual investor’s return and ratios may vary based on the timing
of their transactions in Fund Shares.

Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF
The Investment Objective of the Fund
BDRY’s investment objective is to provide
investors with exposure to the daily change in the price of dry bulk freight futures by tracking the performance of a portfolio (the “BDRY
Benchmark Portfolio” and consisting of exchange-cleared futures contracts on the cost of shipping dry bulk freight (“Freight
Futures”). BDRY seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in the Freight Futures currently
constituting the BDRY Benchmark Portfolio.
The Benchmark Portfolio
The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by
Breakwave Advisors LLC (“Breakwave”), which also serves as BDRY’s CTA. The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio consists of the
Freight Futures, which are a three-month strip of the nearest calendar quarter of futures contracts on specified indexes (each a “Reference
Index”) that measure rates for shipping dry bulk freight. Each Reference Index is published each United Kingdom business day by
the London-based Baltic Exchange Ltd. (the “Baltic Exchange”) and measures the charter rate for shipping dry bulk freight
in a specific size category of cargo ship – Capesize, Panamax or Supramax. The three Reference Indexes are as follows:
●
Capesize : the Capesize 5TC Index;
●
Panamax : the Panamax 4TC Index; and
●
Supramax : the Supramax 6TC Index.
The BDRY Benchmark Component Instruments currently
constituting the BDRY Benchmark Portfolio as of December 31, 2022 include:

BDRY seeks to achieve its investment objective
by investing substantially all of its assets in the Freight Futures currently constituting the BDRY Benchmark Portfolio. The BDRY Benchmark
Portfolio will include all existing positions to maturity and settle them in cash. During any given calendar quarter, the BDRY Benchmark
Portfolio will progressively increase its position to the next calendar quarter three-month strip, thus maintaining constant exposure
to the Freight Futures market as positions mature.
32
The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio will maintain long-only
positions in Freight Futures. The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio will include a combination of Capesize, Panamax and Supramax Freight Futures.
More specifically, the BDRY Benchmark Portfolio will include 50% exposure in Capesize Freight Futures contracts, 40% exposure in Panamax
Freight Futures contracts and 10% exposure in Supramax Freight Futures contracts. The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio will not include and the
Fund will not invest in swaps, non-cleared dry bulk freight forwards or other over-the-counter derivative instruments that are not cleared
through exchanges or clearing houses. The Fund may hold exchange-traded options on Freight Futures. The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio is maintained
by Breakwave and will be rebalanced annually. The Freight Futures currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio, as well as the daily
holdings of the Fund will be available on the Fund’s website at www.drybulketf.com.
When establishing positions in Freight Futures,
BDRY will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 10% to 40% of the notional value of each Freight Futures
position at the time it is established. These margin requirements are established and subject to change from time to time by the relevant
exchanges, clearing houses or the Fund’s futures commission merchant (“FCM”). On a daily basis, the Fund will be obligated
to pay, or entitled to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Freight Futures
positions. Any assets not required to be posted as margin with the FCM will be held at the Fund’s custodian in cash or cash equivalents.
BDRY will hold cash or cash equivalents such as
U.S. Treasuries or other high credit quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for
the U.S. Treasuries and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. The Fund may also
realize interest income from its holdings in U.S. Treasuries or other market rate instruments.

Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
freight rates declined; with the Baltic Dry Index, an index that tracks global spot rates for dry bulk shipping, ending the quarter down
approximately 14%. Slow activity from China, which accounts for the great majority of dry bulk trade, was the main reason for the poor
performance. China’s zero tolerance policy towards the Covid pandemic has led to a considerable slowdown in industrial activity;
and as a result, in infrastructure spending, while the country’s real estate sector remains extremely weak versus recent history.
The combination of those two factors has translated to weaker demand for iron ore, the main ingredient required for steelmaking. The impact
of slower economic activity in China was felt across all dry bulk segments, with the sub-Cape sector freight rates dropping to two-year
lows. Towards the end of the quarter a partial recovery in Capsize spot rates offered some relief in sentiment, but such a recovery remained
quite fragile.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
freight futures experienced a decline reflecting the deterioration in spot rates but also sour sentiment coming from the global weak macroeconomic
environment. With the first calendar quarter of the year historically being the weakest period of the year, freight futures also reflected
such an expectation, and although weather remains the main determinant of future performance during thew winter months, it is still expected
based on futures prices that the first quarter of the year will average below last year’s level. BDRY closely tracked the performance
of short-term dry bulk freight futures. However, with December freight futures contracts settling at a better level versus previous expectations,
first quarter futures performance was offset by the stronger December realized rates and, as such, BDRY ended the quarter relatively flat.

The graphs above compare the returns of BDRY with
the benchmark portfolio returns for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the six months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021. The difference in the NAV price the benchmark value often results in the appearance of a NAV premium or discount to the benchmark.
Differences in the benchmark return and the BDRY net asset value per share are due primarily to the following factors:
●
Benchmark
portfolio uses settlement prices of freight futures vs. BDRY closing Share price,
●
Benchmark
portfolio roll methodology assumes rolls that can happen even at fractions of lots vs. BDRY that uses the real minimum market lot
available (5 days per month),
●
Benchmark
portfolio assumes rolls are happening at the settlement price of the day vs. that buys at a transaction price during the day that
might or might not be equal to the settlement price,
●
Benchmark
portfolio assumes no trading commissions vs. BDRY that pays 10bps for each transaction,
●
Benchmark
portfolio assumes no clearing fees vs. BDRY that pays approximately 3-5bps of total clearing fees for each trade,
●
Benchmark
portfolio assumes no management fees vs. BDRY fee structure of 3.5% of average net assets on an annualized basis, and
●
Creations
and redemptions that lead to transactions that occur at prices that might be different than the settlement prices
There
are no competitors. BDRY is the only Freight futures ETF globally.

40
Calculating NAV
The Fund’s NAV is calculated by:
●
Taking the current market value of its total assets;
●
Subtracting any liabilities; and
●
Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
The Administrator calculates the NAV of the Fund
once each NYSE Arca trading day. The NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. E.T. Trading during the core trading
session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. E.T. The Administrator uses the Baltic Exchange settlement price for the Freight
Futures and option contracts. The Administrator calculates or determines the value of all other Fund investments using market quotations,
if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the close of the NYSE Arca (normally
4:00 p.m. E.T.), in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, the Fund and the Sponsor.
In addition, in order to provide updated information
relating to the Fund for use by investors and market professionals, an updated indicative fund value (“IFV”) is made available
through on-line information services throughout the core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. E.T. to 4:00 p.m. E.T. on each trading day.
The IFV is calculated by using the prior day’s closing NAV per share of the Fund as a base and updating that value throughout the
trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and/or options held by the Fund. Certain Freight
Futures brokers provide real time pricing information to the general public either through their websites or through data vendors such
as Bloomberg or Reuters. The IFV disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time
update of the NAV, because the NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of
the Fund’s investments.
The IFV is disseminated on a per share basis every
15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours. The customary trading hours of the Freight Futures trading are 3:00 a.m.
E.T. to 12:00 p.m. E.T. This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and/or the end of each day during which a Fund’s
shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time trading prices for contracts are not available. During such gaps in time the IFV will
be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the Baltic Exchange immediately preceding the trading session. In addition,
other investments held by the Fund will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party
vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor or broker-dealer quotes. These investments will not be included in the IFV.
The NYSE Arca disseminates the IFV through the
facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the IFV is published on the NYSE Arca’s website and is available through on-line
information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
Dissemination of the IFV provides additional information
that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the
Fund’s shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price
of the Fund’s shares and the IFV. If the market price of the Fund’s shares diverges significantly from the IFV, market professionals
will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if the Fund’s shares appear to be trading at a discount compared
to the IFV, a market professional could buy the Fund shares on the NYSE Arca and take the opposite position in Freight Futures. Such arbitrage
trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the Fund’s shares and the IFV and thus can be beneficial to all market
participants.
41
Critical Accounting Policies
The Fund’s critical accounting policies
are as follows:
Preparation of the financial statements and related
disclosures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate accounting rules
and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Fund’s application of these policies involves judgments and the use of estimates.
Actual results may differ from the estimates used and such differences could be material. The Fund holds a significant portion of its
assets in futures contracts and money market funds, which are held at fair value.
The Fund calculates its net asset value as of
the NAV Calculation Time as described above.
The values which are used by the Fund for its
Freight Futures are provided by the Fund’s commodity broker, which uses market prices when available. In addition, the Fund estimates
interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual
amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
Credit Risk
When the Fund enters into Benchmark Component
Instruments, it will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. For purposes of credit
risk, the counterparty for the Benchmark Component Instruments traded on or cleared by the Baltic Exchange and other futures exchanges
is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges. In general, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share
in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members, which should significantly reduce credit risk. There
can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to the Fund.
The Sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of
these market and credit risks by normally:
●
executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor;
●
limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the Funds;
●
not posting margin directly with a counterparty;
●
limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the FCM; and
●
ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for.
The Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”)
requires all FCMs, such as the Fund’s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate
customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers’ funds and positions, and to maintain specified books
and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit
or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the
CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of
market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from
alleged violations of the CEA. The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
On November 14, 2013, the CFTC published final
regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity
standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to
market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of
the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust
manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs
of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.
42
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Fund does not anticipate making use of borrowings
or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. The Fund meets its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds
of the sale of its investments or from the cash, cash equivalents that it holds. The Fund’s liquidity needs include: redeeming its
shares, providing margin deposits for existing Benchmark Component Instruments, the purchase of additional Benchmark Component Instruments,
and paying expenses.
The Fund generates cash primarily from (i) the
sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and its investments in collateralizing Treasury Securities.
Generally, all of the net assets of the Fund are allocated to trading in Benchmark Component Instruments. Most of the assets of the Fund
are held in Treasury Instruments, cash and/or cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral for trading in Benchmark
Component Instruments. The percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values
of the Benchmark Component Instruments change. Interest earned on interest-bearing assets of the Fund are paid to the Fund.
The investments of the Fund in Benchmark Component
Instruments could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. Such
conditions could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating a position in Benchmark Component Instruments.
Market Risk
Trading in Benchmark Component Instruments such
as futures contracts will involve the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of instruments at
a specified date in the future. The gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements
of the Fund as the Fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date. As a result, the Fund’s
market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts, not from the need to make delivery under the contracts.
The Fund considers the “fair value” of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market
risk associated with the commitment by the Fund to purchase a specific contract will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contracts
held.
The exposure of the Fund to market risk will depend
on a number of factors including the markets for the specific instrument, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates,
the liquidity of the instrument-specific market and the relationships among the contracts held by the Fund.
Regulatory Environment
The regulation of futures markets, futures contracts,
and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive. The CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in
the event of a market emergency including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits, increased margin
requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
43
The regulation of commodity interest transactions
in the United States is an evolving area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable
regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. There is
a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment
in the Fund, or the ability of the Fund to continue to implement its investment strategies. In addition, various national governments
outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodities markets
and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict
but could be substantial and adverse.
The CFTC possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate
the activities of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors with respect to “commodity interests,” such as futures,
swaps and options, and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons and/or entities. Under the CEA, a registered
CPO, such as the Sponsor, is required to make annual filings with the CFTC and NFA describing its organization, capital structure, management
and controlling persons. In addition, the CEA authorizes the CFTC to require and review books and records of, and documents prepared by,
registered CPOs. Pursuant to this authority, the CFTC requires CPOs to keep accurate, current and orderly records for each pool that they
operate. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator (1) if the CFTC finds that the operator’s trading practices
tend to disrupt orderly market conditions, (2) if any controlling person of the operator is subject to an order of the CFTC denying such
person trading privileges on any exchange, and (3) in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Sponsor’s
registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until that registration were to be reinstated, from managing the Fund, and
might result in the termination of the Fund if a successor sponsor is not elected pursuant to the Trust Agreement.
The Fund’s investors are afforded prescribed
rights for reparations under the CEA. Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA. The
CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations
award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and
their respective associated persons.
Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has
been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. At the present time, the NFA is the only self-regulatory
organization for commodity interest professionals, other than futures exchanges. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for
the registration of CPOs and FCMs and their respective associated persons. The Sponsor and the Fund’s clearing broker are members
of the NFA. As such, they will be subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition and consumer protection.
The NFA also arbitrates disputes between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness screening of applicants for
membership and audits of its existing members. Neither the Trust nor the Fund are required to become a member of the NFA.
The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit
any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in
the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA has approved or endorsed that person or that person’s trading program
or objectives. The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such
approval or endorsement. Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
Futures exchanges in the United States are subject
to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade
or electronic trading facility. Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as
administered by the CFTC. The CFTC’s function is to implement the CEA’s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive
speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets. In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations
themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
44
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in response to the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 and it significantly
altered the regulatory regime to which the securities and commodities markets are subject. To date, the CFTC has issued proposed or final
versions of almost all of the rules it is required to promulgate under the Dodd-Frank Act. The provisions of the new law include the requirement
that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests, including agricultural, energy, and metal-based commodity
futures contracts, options on such futures contracts and cleared and uncleared swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures
contracts and options; new registration and recordkeeping requirements for swap market participants; capital and margin requirements for
“swap dealers” and “major swap participants,” as determined by the new law and applicable regulations; reporting
of all swaps transactions to swap data repositories; and the mandatory use of clearinghouse mechanisms for sufficiently standardized swap
transactions that were historically entered into in the over-the-counter market, but are now designated as subject to the clearing requirement;
and margin requirements for over-the counter swaps that are not subject to the clearing requirements.
The Dodd-Frank Act was intended to reduce systemic
risks that may have contributed to the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Since the first draft of what became the Dodd-Frank Act, supporters
and opponents have debated the scope of the legislation. As the administrations of the U.S. change, the interpretation and implementation
will change with them. Nevertheless, regulatory reform of any kind may have a significant impact on U.S. regulated entities.
Current rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank
Act require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards,
customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants
that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures
trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital
and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and
the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.
Regulatory bodies outside the U.S. have also passed
or proposed, or may propose in the future, legislation similar to that proposed by the Dodd-Frank Act or other legislation containing
other restrictions that could adversely impact the liquidity of and increase costs of participating in the commodities markets. For example,
the European Union Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2014/65/EU) and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014) (together “MiFID II”), which has applied since January 3, 2018, governs the provision of investment services
and activities in relation to, as well as the organized trading of, financial instruments such as shares, bonds, units in collective investment
schemes and derivatives. In particular, MiFID II requires EU Member States to apply position limits to the size of a net position which
a person can hold at any time in commodity derivatives traded on EU trading venues and in “economically equivalent” over-the-counter
(“OTC”) contracts. By way of further example, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 648/2012,
as amended) (“EMIR”) introduced certain requirements in respect of OTC derivatives including: (i) the mandatory clearing of
OTC derivative contracts declared subject to the clearing obligation; (ii) risk mitigation techniques in respect of un-cleared OTC derivative
contracts, including the mandatory margining of un-cleared OTC derivative contracts; and (iii) reporting and recordkeeping requirements
in respect of all derivatives contracts. In the event that the requirements under EMIR and MiFID II apply, these are expected to increase
the cost of transacting derivatives.
In addition, considerable regulatory attention
has been focused on non-traditional publicly distributed investment pools such as the Fund. Furthermore, various national governments
have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in certain commodity markets and the need to regulate the
derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial
and adverse.
45
Off Balance Sheet Financing
As of December 31, 2022, neither the Trust nor
the Fund have any loan guarantees, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into
in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks service providers undertake in
performing services which are in the best interests of the Fund. While the exposure of the Fund under these indemnification provisions
cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Fund.
Redemption Basket Obligation
Other than as necessary to meet the investment
objective of the Fund and pay the contractual obligations described below, the Fund will require liquidity to redeem Redemption Baskets.
The Fund intends to satisfy this obligation through the transfer of cash of the Fund (generated, if necessary, through the sale of Treasury
Instruments) in an amount proportionate to the number of Shares being redeemed.
Contractual Obligations
The primary contractual obligations of the Fund
will be with the Sponsor and certain other service providers.
Management and CTA Fees
BDRY pays the Sponsor a management fee (the “Sponsor
Fee”) in consideration of the Sponsor’s advisory services to the Fund. Additionally, BDRY pays its commodity trading advisor
a license and service fee (the “CTA Fee”).
BDRY pays the Sponsor Fee, monthly in arrears,
in an amount equal to the greater of 0.15% per year of BDRY’s average daily net assets; or $125,000. BDRY’s Sponsor Fee is
paid in consideration of the Sponsor’s management services to BDRY. BDRY also pays Breakwave the CTA Fee monthly in arrears, for
the use of BDRY’s Benchmark Portfolio in an amount equal to 1.45% per annum of BDRY’s average daily net assets.
Breakwave has agreed to waive its CTA Fee and
the Sponsor has agreed to correspondingly assume the remaining expenses of BDRY so that BDRY’s expenses do not exceed an annual
rate of 3.50%, excluding brokerage commissions, interest expense, and extraordinary expenses, of the value of BDRY’s average daily
net assets (the “BDRY Expense Cap”). The assumption of expenses and waiver of BDRY’s CTA Fee are contractual on the
part of the Sponsor and Breakwave, respectively, through March 31, 2024. Breakwave may recoup any fees waived pursuant to the BDRY Expense
Cap on or after September 1, 2022. No repayment will be made if such repayment causes BDRY’s total expenses after the repayment
to exceed either (i) the BDRY Expense Cap in place at the time such amounts were waived, or (ii) the then current BDRY Expense Cap. Such
recoupment is limited to three years from the date the amount is initially waived. If after that March 31, 2024, the Sponsor and/or Breakwave
no longer assumed expenses or waived the CTA Fee, respectively, BDRY could be adversely impacted, including in its ability to achieve
its investment objective.
The assumption of expenses by the Sponsor for
BDRY, pursuant to the BDRY Expense Cap, amounted to $-0- and $-0- for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
and $-0- and $-0- for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements of Operations. The
waiver of Breakwave’s CTA fees, pursuant to the undertaking, amounted to $38,707 and $-0- for the three months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, and $66,332 and $-0- for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as disclosed in the
Statements of Operations. BDRY currently accrues its daily expenses based upon established individual expense amounts or the BDRY Expense
Cap, whichever aggregate amount is less. At the end of each month, the accrued amount is remitted to the Sponsor as the Sponsor is responsible
for the payment of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund. BDRY’s total expenses amounted
to $505,629 and $955,267 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $976,903 and $1,751,167, for the six
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.
46
The Fund’s ongoing fees, costs and expenses
of its operation, not subject to the Expense Cap include brokerage and other fees and commissions incurred in connection with the trading
activities of the Fund, and extraordinary expenses (including, but not limited to, legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and
any indemnification related thereto). Expenses subject to the Expense Cap include (i) expenses incurred in connection with registering
additional Shares of the Fund or offering Shares of the Fund; (ii) the routine expenses associated with the preparation and, if required,
the printing and mailing of monthly, quarterly, annual and other reports required by applicable U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities,
Trust meetings and preparing, printing and mailing proxy statements to Shareholders; (iii) the routine services of the Trustee, legal
counsel and independent accountants; (iv) routine accounting, bookkeeping, custodial and transfer agency services, whether performed by
an outside service provider or by affiliates of the Sponsor; (v) postage and insurance; (vi) costs and expenses associated with client
relations and services; (vii) costs of preparation of all federal, state, local and foreign tax returns and any taxes payable on the income,
assets or operations of the Fund.
While the Sponsor has agreed to pay registration
fees to the SEC and any other regulatory agency in connection with the initial offering and sale of the Shares offered through the Fund’s
prospectus, the legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated with such registration, the Fund will be responsible for any
registration fees and related expenses incurred in connection with any future offer and sale of Shares of the Fund in excess of those
offered through its initial prospectus.
Any general expenses of the Trust will be allocated
to the Fund and any other future series of the Trust as determined by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion. The Trust is also
responsible for extraordinary expenses, including, but not limited to, legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any indemnification
related thereto. The Trust and/or the Sponsor may be required to indemnify the Trustee, Distributor or Administrator under certain circumstances.
The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments
that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as the NAV and trading levels to meet investment objectives for the
Fund will not be known until a future date. These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option
to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of the Fund’s existence. The parties may terminate these agreements
earlier for certain reasons listed in the agreements.
