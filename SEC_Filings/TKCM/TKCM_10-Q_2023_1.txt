4 Table of Contents   TOKEN COMMUNITIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization and Line of Business   Token Communities Ltd. (the “Company” or “Limited”) was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 6, 2014, under the name Pacific Media Group Enterprises, Inc.  On April 7, 2017, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware, changing its name to Extract Pharmaceuticals Inc. On January 26, 2018, the Board of Directors adopted an Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, changing its name to Token Communities Ltd.  The Company is a development stage company that researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology.   On February 26, 2018, the Company entered into an Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement with Token Communities PLC (“PLC”).  Under the Agreement, the Company’s majority shareholder returned
19,266,000
common shares to treasury, and at closing
100 % of the issued and outstanding shares of PLC were acquired by the Company, for
172,800,000
newly issued common shares equal to
64 % of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of the closing date, thus making the stockholders of PLC the majority stockholders of the Company. The transaction closed on May 18, 2018.  This transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since PLC obtained control of Limited. Accordingly, the merger of PLC into Limited was recorded as a recapitalization of PLC, PLC being treated as the continuing entity. The transaction was treated as a recapitalization and not as a business combination. Limited had
116,466,000
shares outstanding prior to the merger. At the time of the merger, Limited’s principal stockholder surrendered
19,266,000
shares, which were cancelled.  After the merger the total number of Limited shares outstanding was
270,000,000 .   PLC is a Gibraltar Financial Advisory firm which specializes in Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and Fin-Tech investment in incubating as well as advising and managing qualified companies in the blockchain and distributed ledger technologies arena, including smart contracts, TGEs, DApps, and more. Advisement comprises the authoring of industry standard White Papers, technical aspects, design and implementation of market strategies, business appraisal and more. All potential clients are vetted and Anti-Money Laundering / Know-Your-Customer approved. The Company is also developing its own software technology with its dedicated team of developers.   The historical financial statements presented are the financial statements of PLC. The Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement was treated as a recapitalization and not as a business combination; therefore, no pro forma information is disclosed. At the date of the merger, the net liabilities of the legal acquirer, Limited, were $ 57,107 .   The combined entities are referred to hereafter as the “Company.”    On May 28, 2020, the Company acquired
3.5
billion iRide tokens in exchange for
80
million shares provided to iRide.io Tech Pte., Ltd., valued at $ 8,000 , which was immediately expensed.
5 Table of Contents   On July 14, 2020, a change in control of the Company was affected by a privately held corporation (American Software Company, controlled by 2 individuals) acquiring
83 % of the outstanding stock from other control individuals.  As part of this transaction, the Company transferred the
3.5
billion iRide tokens and
1,745,406
shares of it’s common stock to American Software in exchange for all technology, software codes and other intelligent products of the Lukki Exchange, a non-operating cyber coin exchange.  Since the Lukki exchange had no previous material revenue nor assets, the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition and due to the facts that it has no value, and the parties to this transaction are related, the transaction has been accounted for as $( 0 ), the value of the tokens are $(0), and no financial statements are being provided as part of the transaction.     As a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement shareholders agreed to cancel an aggregate of
174,540,600
shares of Common Stock of the Company, and the holders of the Company’s Series A, B, C, D and E warrants agreed to the cancellation of all such warrants.   On April 25, 2022 Token Communities, Ltd. (the “Company”) closed on the sale of the “Lukki Exchange” and related Lukki tokens in exchange for Fifty Thousand Dollars. This was due to the Chinese governments restrictions on foreign cryptocurrencies. Given this the Company has remained in the advisory and consulting or companies regarding block chain technology, and has maintained a remote staff in China to conduct research and development on naturopathic medicine.
Basis of Presentation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements (“CFS”) were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Limited’s functional currency is the United States Dollars (“$” or “USD”) and Limited’s wholly-owned subsidiary, PLC’s functional currency is the Pound Sterling (“GBP”).     Going Concern   The accompanying CFS were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The Company had a stockholders’ deficit of $ 3,441,778
at December 31, 2022 and has incurred losses from operations since inception and expects to continue to generate operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or acquire or develop a business that generates sufficient positive cash flows from operations.     The accompanying CFS do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.     6 Table of Contents   Foreign Currency Translation   The accounts of Limited are maintained in USD and the accounts of PLC are maintained in GBP. The accounts of PLC are translated into USD in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 830
Foreign Currency Transaction
, with the GBP as the functional currency. According to Topic 830, all assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, stockholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and statement of operations items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with ASC Topic 220,
Comprehensive Income . Gains and losses resulting from the translations of foreign currency transactions and balances are reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The following table details the exchange rates used for the periods.       December 31,  2022     December 31, 2021   Period end: GBP to USD exchange rate   $ 1.12     $ 1.37   Average period: GBP to USD exchange rate   $ 1.17     $ 1.31     NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates   The preparation of CFS in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the CFS and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.   Principles of Consolidation   The accompanying CFS include the accounts of Limited and its wholly-owned Subsidiary, PLC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.     7 Table of Contents   Cash Equivalents   For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificate of deposits, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.   Accounts Receivable   Accounts receivable are recorded, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentration, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to determine if the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified.   As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was zero, respectively.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, trust liability and advances, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.   FASB ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , requires disclosure of the fair value (“FV”) of financial instruments held by the Company. FASB ASC Topic 825,
Financial Instruments , defines FV, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of FV measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for FV measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their FVs because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:     · Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.         · Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.         · Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology use one or more unobservable inputs which are significant to the FV measurement.
8 Table of Contents   The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under FASB ASC Topic 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , and FASB ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging .   The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model based on various assumptions. The Company’s derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect FV at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the FV being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.   Revenue Recognition   ASU No. 2014-09 ,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“Topic 606”), became effective for the Company on July 1, 2018. The Company’s revenue recognition disclosure reflects its updated accounting policies that are affected by this new standard. The Company applied the “modified retrospective” transition method for open contracts for the implementation of  Topic 606.
As sales are and have been primarily from advisory fees and related services, and the Company has no significant post-delivery obligations, this did not result in a material recognition of revenue on our accompanying CFS for the cumulative impact of applying this new standard. The Company made no adjustments to its previously-reported total revenues, as those periods continue to be presented in accordance with its historical accounting practices under
Topic 605, Revenue Recognition .   Revenue from advisory fees and related services are recognized under  Topic 606  in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:     · executed contract(s) with our customer(s) that we believe is legally enforceable;         · identification of performance obligation in the respective contract;         · determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;         · allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and         · recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
9 Table of Contents   These five elements, as applied to the Company’s only revenue category, are summarized below:     · Advisory fees and related services – the Company charges advisory fees for a suite of one to two dozen services that include advising on where to establish a corporation, establishing the corporation (often Gibraltar or Malta), writing white paper, setting up website, making videos or animations describing the company and its business, engaging in public relations, and introducing potential investors.      Income Taxes   The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,
Income Taxes . ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.   Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50 % likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.   Basic and Diluted Earnings (loss) Per Share   Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260,
Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the assumption that all dilutive securities are converted.  Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during any of the periods presented in these financial statements.   Foreign Currency Transactions and Comprehensive Income   U.S. GAAP generally requires recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Certain statements, however, require entities to report specific changes in assets and liabilities, such as gain or loss on foreign currency translation, as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet. Such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiary is the GBP. Translation loss of $ 5,603
at December 31, 2022 is classified as an item of other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ deficit section of the balance sheet.     10 Table of Contents   Statement of Cash Flows   Cash flows from the Company’s operations are calculated based upon the local currencies using the average translation rates. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-01,
Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business . The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company’s CFS.   In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,
which requires restricted cash to be presented with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and disclosure of how the statement of cash flows reconciles to the balance sheet if restricted cash is shown separately from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company’s CFS.   In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory , which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company’s CFS.   In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 , Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . ASU 2016-15 provides guidance for targeted changes with respect to how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statements of cash flows, with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company’s CFS.   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company’s CFS.     11 Table of Contents   In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers .  ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition.  ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract.  The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.   Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein.  Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  The Company adopted this ASU on October 13, 2017 and used the modified retrospective method of adoption. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s CFS.   Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying CFS. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.   Risks and Uncertainties   In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally fiscal first quarter and potentially beyond.   Because COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, all of our office locations have been closed effective April 1, 2020.   The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   The measures taken to date will impact the Company’s business for the fiscal fourth quarter and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.     12 Table of Contents   NOTE 3 - ACCRUED EXPENSES   Accrued expenses payable consisted of the following at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022:       December 31, 2022     June 30, 2022   Director fees   $ 236,582     $ 236,582   Accrued professional services     31,000       31,000   Other     86,960       86,960   Total Accrued Expenses   $ 354,542     $ 354,542     NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   Overview   Token Communities Ltd. (the “Company” or “Limited”) researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology.  Part of our original goal was to attract Chinese crypto currencies to trade on our exchange.  Unfortunately China no longer permitted foreign crypto currency operations such as these and we began.  During the end of 2022 the Company began researching developing naturopathic medicine to diversify the operations of the Company.  At the time we formed a research and development team.  This team developed six potential products as wellness supplements with a company located in Xi-An, China. This led the Company to acquire  Elements of Health and Wellness, Inc. as discussed in Note 7 of the Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   We are an early stage company and have generated insufficient revenue to date. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.   The Company had $312 in cash as of December 31, 2022. The Company has negative working capital of approximately $2,202,394, and total stockholders’ deficit of $3,441,778 as of December 31, 2022.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, and while the Company hopes to achieve profitable operations in the future, if not it may need to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve viable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as its ability to raise capital. The Company’s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to become profitable and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses, the Company may not be able to maintain profitability. The Company’s ability to continue in existence is dependent on the Company’s ability to achieve profitable operations.   Should we not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar instrument(s), including but not limited to the current outstanding convertible notes. The Company has no committed external source of funds, and there is no guarantee we would be able to raise such funds. The Company plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and increasing revenue through sales of Company services and or products, or through financing activities as mentioned above.   Operating Activities   Cash flow from operating activities –
Net cash used in operating activities was ($163,626) for the six months ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of net loss from operations during the period.   Investing Activities   Cash flow from investing activities –
Net cash used in investing activities was 0 for the six months ended December 31, 2022.   Financing Activities   Cash flow from financing activities –
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, our financing activities provided cash of $167,000 primarily from an advance from related party.     16 Table of Contents   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no accounting standards and interpretations issued which are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, operations or cash flows.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our President and CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure due to the material weaknesses described below.   Based on our evaluation under the framework described above, our management concluded that we had “material weaknesses” (as such term is defined below) in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following as of the Evaluation Date:     1) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.   A “material weakness” is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.   A system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.     17 Table of Contents   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
