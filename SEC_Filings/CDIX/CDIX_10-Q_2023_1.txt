SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Nature of Operations
Legacy Card Company, LLC (“Legacy”)
was formed as a Limited Liability Company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted from a California Limited Liability
Company to a Nevada Corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff Lexington Corporation (“Cardiff Lexington”,
the “Company”), a publicly held corporation. On April 13, 2021, Cardiff Lexington Corporation converted from a Florida Corporation
to a Nevada Corporation.
In the first quarter of 2013, it was decided to
restructure Cardiff Lexington into a holding company that adopted a new business model known as "Collaborative Governance,"
a form of governance enabling businesses to take advantage of the potential access to capital markets provided by affiliation with a publicly-traded
company. Cardiff Lexington began targeting the acquisition of niche companies with high growth potential. The reason for this strategy
was to protect the Company’s shareholders by acquiring businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and
management that had the ability to offer a return to investors.
Description of Business
Cardiff Lexington consists of the following wholly owned subsidiaries:
We Three, LLC dba Affordable Housing Initiative (“AHI”),
acquired May 15, 2014
Romeo’s Alpharetta, LLC dba Romeo’s NY Pizza (“Romeo’s
Pizza”), acquired September 30, 2014; Sold July 1, 2021.
Edge View Properties, Inc., (“Edge View”) acquired
July 16, 2014
Repicci’s Franchise Group, LLC (“Repicci’s
Group”), acquired August 10, 2016; Sold September 1, 2021.
Platinum Tax Defenders, LLC (“Platinum Tax”),
acquired July 31, 2018
JM Enterprises 1, Inc. dba Key Tax Group (“Key Tax”),
acquired May 8, 2019; Sold December 31, 2021
Red Rock Travel Group, LLC (“Red Rock”), acquired
July 31, 2018, discontinued May 31, 2019
Nova Ortho and Spine, PLLC (“Nova”), acquired
May 31, 2021
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying September 30, 2022 interim condensed
consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those
rules and regulations, but we believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been included in
the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. These statements should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The
results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any
other periods.
10
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Management
uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making estimates. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
COVID-19
Pandemic
The outbreak
of a novel coronavirus throughout the world, including the United States, during early calendar year 2021 has caused widespread business
and economic disruption through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (“COVID-19
Pandemic”). The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict,
as the response to the COVID-19 Pandemic is rapidly evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where the
Company operates. It is expected that many of the Company's customers and suppliers could be impacted by these closings and restrictions
which could materially and adversely affect demand for our products, our ability to obtain or deliver inventory or services, and our ability
to collect accounts receivables as customers face higher liquidity and solvency risk. Furthermore, capital markets and economies worldwide
have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and it is possible that it could cause an economic downturn, recession, or
depression. Such economic disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business. Policymakers around the world have responded
with fiscal and monetary policy actions to support the economy. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is reported on the balance
sheet at the net amounts expected to be collected by the Company. Management closely monitors outstanding accounts receivable and charges
off to expense any balances that are determined to be uncollectible which was zero as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectfully.
As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had accounts receivable of $6,829,160 and $4,948,796, respectively. Accounts
receivables are primarily generated from our subsidiaries in their normal course of business.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures
for renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property, equipment or leasehold improvements are capitalized. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes based on the following estimated useful lives:
Classification
Useful Life
Equipment, furniture, and fixtures
5 - 7 years
Medical equipment
10 years
Leasehold improvements
10 years or lease term, if shorter
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and indefinite-lived brands are not amortized,
but are evaluated for impairment annually or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our impairment testing of goodwill
is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. The annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangibles is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future
cash flows and operating plans. The Company believes such assumptions are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace
participants. During nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment. The Company
based this decision on impairment testing of the underlying assets, expected cash flows, decreased asset value and other factors.
11
Valuation of long-lived assets
In accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360-10-5, “ Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ”, all long-lived
assets such as plant and equipment and construction in progress held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of assets to estimated discounted net cash flows expected to be generated
by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue
from contracts with customers (“Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were
not completed as of January 1, 2018.
The Company applies the following five-step model
to determine revenue recognition:
·
Identification of a contract with a customer
·
Identification of the performance obligations in the contact
·
Determination of the transaction price
·
Allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance allocation
·
Recognition of revenue when performance obligations are satisfied
The Company only applies the five-step model when
it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers
to the customer. At contract inception and once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses services
promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised service is distinct.
The Company’s financial services sector
reports revenues as services are performed and its healthcare sector reports revenues at the time control of the services transfer to
the customer and from providing licensed and/or certified orthopedic procedures. Our healthcare subsidiary does not have contract liabilities
or deferred revenue as there are no amounts prepaid for services.
Established billing rates are not the same as
actual amounts recovered for our healthcare subsidiary.  They generally do not reflect what the Company is ultimately paid and
therefore are not reported in our condensed unaudited financial statements.  The Company is typically paid amounts based on
established charges per procedure with guidance from the annually updated Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) guidelines
(a code set maintained by the American Medical Association through the CPT Editorial Panel), that designates relative value units (“RVU's”)
and a suggested range of charges for each procedure which is then assigned a CPT code.
This fee is discounted to reflect the percentage
paid to the Company “using a modifier” recognized by each insurance carrier for services, less deductible, co-pay, and contractual
adjustments which are deducted from the calculated fee.  The net revenue is recorded at the time the services are rendered.
Contract Fees (Non-PIP)
The Company has contract fees for amounts earned
from its Non-Personal Injury Protection (“PIP”) related procedures, typically car accidents, and are collected on a contingency
basis. These cases are sold to a factor, who bears the risk of economic benefit or loss. After selling patient cases to the factor, any
additional funds collected by the Company are remitted to the factor.
12
Service Fees – Net (PIP)
The Company generates services fees from performing
various procedures on the date the services are performed. These services primarily include slip and falls as well as smaller nominal
Non-PIP services. Fees are collected primarily from third party insurance providers. These revenues are based on established insurance
billing rates less allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts. These contractual adjustments vary by insurance company
and self-pay patients. The Company computes these contractual adjustments and collection allowances based on its historical collection
experience.
Completing the paperwork for each case and preparing
it for billing takes approximately ten business days after a procedure is performed. The majority of claims are then filed electronically
except for those remaining insurance carriers requiring paper filing. An initial response is usually received within four weeks from electronic
filing and up to Nine weeks from paper filing. Responses may be a payment, a denial, or a request for additional information.
Historical collection rates are estimated using
the most current prior 18-month historical payment and collection percentages. The Company generally receives all of its collections within
18 months from the date of service. The Company accounts for chargebacks as they occur and records an estimate for expected chargebacks
as they are received from insurance companies.
For the Nine months ended September 30, 2022 and
2021, respectively, the Company did not record any bad debt expense. Additionally, the Company has not recorded any estimate for expected
chargebacks.
The Company’s contracts for both its contract
and service fees each contain a single performance obligation (providing orthopedic services), as the promise to transfer the individual
services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, as a result, the entire transaction
price is allocated to this single performance obligation.
Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenues (net)
when the patient receives orthopedic care services. Our patient service contracts generally have performance obligations which are satisfied
at a point in time. The performance obligation is for onsite or off-site care provided. Patient service contracts are generally fixed-price,
and the transaction price is in the contract. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our patients
are satisfied; generally, at the time of patient care.
Financial Services Income
The Company generates revenue from providing tax
resolution services to individuals and business owners
that have federal and state tax liabilities
by assisting its clients to settle outstanding tax debts. Additionally, services include back taxes, offer in compromise, audit representation,
amending tax returns, tax preparation, wage garnishment relief, removal of bank levies and liens, and other financial challenges.
The Company recognizes revenues for these services as services are performed.
Rental Income
The Company’s rent revenue is derived from
the mobile home leases. The expired leases are considered month-to-month leases. In accordance with section ASC 842, the cost of property
held for leasing by major classes of property according to nature or function, and the amount of accumulated depreciation in total, is
presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. There are no contingent
rentals included in income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. With the exception of the month-to-month
leases, revenue was recognized on a straight-line basis and amortized into income on a monthly basis, over the lease term.
13
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising
costs are included as a component of cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and changes in members’
equity. The Company recognized advertising and marketing expense of $93,905 and $221,690 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2022, respectively. The Company recognized advertising and marketing expense of $317,899 and $881,591 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2021, respectively.
Valuation of Derivative Instruments
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815-10,
Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815-10”) , requires that
embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with freestanding derivative instruments such as convertible promissory
notes, on their issuance date to determine whether they would be considered a derivative liability and measured at their fair value for
accounting purposes. The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments
are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for
as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date, with changes
in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income.
For option based simple derivative financial instruments,
the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates.
The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed
at the end of each reporting period.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level
of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (1) market participant
assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs), and (2) an entity’s own assumptions
about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The
fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy are described below:
Level Input Definition
Level 1
Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
Level 2
Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.
Level 3
Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
14
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions under the recognition and measurement principles of
the fair value recognition provisions of section 718-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-30-6
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance
of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
The measurement date used to determine the fair
value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable
that performance will occur.
Generally, all forms of share-based payments,
including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on
the awards’ grant date, based on estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
The expense resulting from share-based payments
is recorded in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Equity Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring
Goods or Services
The Company early adopted ASU No 2018-07 for equity
instruments issued to parties other than employees.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are determined in accordance with
ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ” (“ASC 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how
companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to
be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely
than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be
measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the
tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
For the periods ended September 30, 2022 and September
30, 2021, the Company did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions and did not have any significant unrecognized
uncertain tax positions.
Loss per Share
FASB ASC Subtopic 260,
Earnings Per Share
(“ASC 260”), provides for the calculation of "Basic" and "Diluted" earnings per share. Basic earnings
per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of
common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities
include outstanding stock options, warrants, and debts convertible into common shares. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities
is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase
in the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.
15
Going Concern
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of
assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained operating losses since its inception
and has negative working capital and an accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has sustained recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit of
$67.8 million and a working capital deficit of approximately $3.1 million. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern and the appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional cash infusions. Management
is seeking additional capital and believes the raising of capital will allow the Company to fund its cash flow shortfalls and pursue new
acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient capital from debt or equity transactions or
from operations in the necessary time frame or on terms acceptable to it. Should the Company be unable to raise sufficient funds, it may
be required to curtail its operating plans. In addition, the Company may be required to make cost reductions. No assurance can be given
that the Company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future. Should the Company not be able to
raise sufficient funds, it may cause cessation of operations.
Recent Accounting Standards
Changes to accounting principles are established
by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) to the FASB's Codification. We consider the applicability and
impact of all ASU's on our financial position, results of operations, shareholders’ deficit. cash flows, or presentation thereof.
In August
2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-06 (“ASU 2021-06”) “ Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) .” ASU 2021-06 reduces the
number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments by eliminating the cash conversion and beneficial conversion accounting models.
As a result, the Company’s convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost
as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type
of contracts primarily affected by this update are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the
current guidance due to a failure to meet the settlement conditions of the derivative scope exception. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, we
classified the previously identified beneficial conversion features to the associated debt. We also determined, that in accordance with
ASU 2017-11, such beneficial conversion features are not considered a liability classified derivative.
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments, which supersedes current guidance by requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred.
The new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets including trade and other
receivables at each reporting date. The new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables
and other contractual rights to receive cash. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments -- Credit Losses
(Topic 326), Derivatives and hedging (Topic 815) and Leases (Topic 842), which extends the effective date of Topic 326 for certain companies
until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal
year beginning January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted.
Management does not expect that the adoption of
this standard will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
16
Reclassifications
Certain accounts relating to the prior year have
been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the net income or net
assets as previously reported.
2.
ACQUISITIONS
Nova Ortho and Spine, LLC
On May 31, 2021 the Company completed the acquisition
of Nova Ortho and Spine LLC. Sellers received a cash payment in the amount of $2,500,000 and were issued 894,834 shares of Series J Preferred
Stock of the Company with a par value of $0.001 and a stated value of $4.00 with an aggregate stated value equal to $3,579,334 for a total
transaction of $6,079,334. The Preferred J stock rights and privileges include voting rights, a conversion ratio of 1:2:00. The Preferred
J shares have a lock-up/leak-out limiting the sale of stock for 6 months after which conversions and sales are limited to 20% of their
portfolio per year, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement. The parties further agreed to performance based contingent
supplement payment to Sellers in 2022 should one year from the closing date the Company’s trailing twelve months minimum Pre-Tax
Net Income exceed $1,979,320, the “Milestone”, which in that event would cause the issuance to Sellers of 818,750
additional shares of Preferred J Stock, with an aggregate stated value equal to $3,275,000.
On August 25, 2022 under the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement entered on May 31, 2021 between the Company and the former owners of its Nova Ortho and Spine subsidiary and an addendum
to that agreement regarding the acquisition supplemental payment the parties recognized unanticipated series of events which prevented
alternative financing and equity funding during the initial year that impacted the Milestone outcome, and the parties acknowledged the
significant gains and accomplishments during the initial year. Based upon those accomplishments and the performance of the subsidiary
during its initial year the Company agreed to issue the supplemental payment of 818,750 additional shares of Preferred Series J Stock,
with an aggregate stated value equal to $3,275,000.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Management has decided to divest from the food
services sector due primarily to a shift in strategy to focus time and resources on opportunities in the financial services sector to
build upon its tax subsidiaries with related debt, credit, billing, real estate and healthcare. The Company’s restaurant franchise
operations have been hard hit by the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent directives and responses to this crisis
taken by federal, state, and local governments. In light of current circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company, as
a public reporting company, must evaluate what the Company should and are obligated to do in order to protect shareholders from the negative
effects of this pandemic.
As a result, management entered into agreements
with the existing managers who were the original owners of Romeo’s NY Pizza (“Romeo’s”) and Repicci’s Franchise
Group (“Repicci’s”) to buyback the subsidiaries previously purchased by Cardiff Lexington Corporation
The Company and the Repicci’s manager have
entered into a Resignation, Release & Buyback Agreement and a Resignation, Release & Buyback Agreement Addendum (“Repicci’s
Agreements”) which was effective September 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Repicci’s Agreement, the Repicci’s manager resigned
employment from the Company effective September 1, 2021 and has purchased the Repicci’s subsidiary in exchange for returning 81,601
Preferred Shares Series H stock (“Preferred H”) which is held by the Company as treasury stock. The Repicci’s manager
retained 37,500 shares of Preferred H shares subject to the terms of the Repicci’s Agreements. There was a gain on disposal in the
amount of $216,013 in September 2021 which represented net assets and liabilities at the time of sale back.
The Company and the Romeo’s manager have
entered into a Resignation, Release & Buyback Agreement and a Resignation, Release & Buyback Agreement Addendum (“Romeo
Agreements”) which is effective July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Romeo Agreement, Romeo’s manager resigned employment from the
Company effective July 1, 2021 and has purchased back the Romeo’s subsidiary in exchange for returning 212,500 Preferred Shares
Series D stock (“Preferred D”). The Romeo’s manager will retain 37,500 shares of Preferred D shares subject to the terms
of the Romeo Agreements. There was a loss on disposal in the amount of $21,140 in July 2021 which represented net assets and liabilities
at the time of sale back.
Cardiff Lexington filed
a lawsuit against investors in Red Rock Travel seeking a judgement declaring that convertible secured notes issued to them by Red Rock
Travel Group purportedly convertible into Cardiff’s common stock, to be null and void, and defendants subsequently filed a counterclaim.
On July 29, 2022 the parties entered into a mediated settlement agreement whereby defendants agreed to dismiss all claims against Cardiff
Lexington related to Red Rock Travel notes and accrued interest in the amount of $510,418 and further agreed to cancel and return common
stock and warrants issued to claimants in a related 2020 settlement. Cardiff agreed to issue Defendants 592 million restricted common
shares at $.0003 per share ($180,000). As a result of the settlement agreement, the convertible notes and accrued interest has been written-off
by the Company in the third quarter of 2022 resulting in a gain of $510,417 which is recorded in discontinued operation. As of September
30, 2022, 66,666,666 shares were issued and recorded in common stock for $66,667, additional paid in capital for $46,667 and $157,600
was recorded in liabilities as shares to be issued.
Prior to the Mediated Settlement, the Company
continued to carry Red Rock liabilities on its balance sheet including accounts payables and accrued expenses of $1,872,086, convertible
notes payable of $240,000, accrued interest of $214,318 and a derivative liability of $378,877 as of September 30, 2021. The party responsible
for the convertible notes and related accrued interest is in dispute and is currently in litigation. The derivative liability is a function
of the convertible notes and accrued interest. And the accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,872,086 is deemed to be the responsibility
of the current owners of Red Rock and was written-off by the Company in the third quarter of 2021 resulting in a gain of $328,718 which
is recorded in discontinued operation.
On May 1, 2018, the Company entered into a stock
for stock purchase agreement with the sellers of Red Rock Travel, LLC and a related management agreement to manage Red Rock Travel, LLC
(“Red Rock”). The terms and conditions of those agreements were subsequently violated causing the transaction to be reversed
and dissolved on May 31, 2019. Red Rock reverted to its previous ownership, the Company canceled the preferred series K shares related
to the aborted acquisition and the Company filed notice with the State of Florida of the dissolution.
25
On April 26, 2021, the Company filed a lawsuit
against Investors of Red Rock seeking a judgment declaring that convertible secured notes totaling $240,000 issued by Red Rock and purportedly
convertible into the Company’s common stock, be deemed null and void. The Company continues to maintain the liability of these
Red Rock Investor notes on its balance sheet under discontinued operations together with corresponding accrued interest and related derivative
liability. Subsequently, in the first quarter of 2022, the company settled a $40,000 note with one Red Rock Investor. Litigation and
settlement discussions continue on the remaining $200,000 of Red Rock Investor notes.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases
ASC 842, “Leases”, requires that a
lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases, A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial
position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by
class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transaction, lessees and lessors are required to recognize
and measure leases at either the effective date (the “effective date method”) or the beginning of the earliest period presented
(the “comparative method”) using a modified retrospective approach. Under the effective date method, the Company’s comparative
period reporting is unchanged. In contrast, under the comparative method, the Company’s date of initial application is the beginning
of the earliest comparative period presented, and the Topic 842 transition guidance is then applied to all comparative periods presented.
Further, under either transition method, the standard includes certain practical expedients intended to ease the burden of adoption. The
Company adopted ASC 842, January 1, 2021, using the effective date method and elected certain practical expedients allowing the Company
not to reassess:
·
whether expired or existing contracts contain leases under the new definition of a lease;
·
lease classification for expired or existing leases; and
·
whether previously capitalized initial direct costs would qualify for capitalization under Topic 842.
The Company also made the accounting policy decision
not to recognize lease assets and liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less.
The Company recorded operating lease expense of
$60,878 and $91,726 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the Company recorded operating lease expense
of $231,028 and $108,979 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the related notes,
and the other financial information included in this report. For ease of reference, “the Company”, ‘Cardiff”,

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking

Overview
Cardiff Lexington Corporation is a holding company
with no stand-alone operations and no material assets other than its ownership interest in its subsidiaries. All of the Company's operations
are conducted through, and its income derived from, its various subsidiaries, which are organized and operated according to the laws
of their jurisdiction of incorporation, and consolidated by the Company.
To date, Cardiff consists of the following wholly
owned subsidiaries:
We Three, LLC, d/b/a Affordable Housing Initiative
(“AHI”),
which we acquired on May 15, 2014, is an affordable home acquirer located in Maryville, Tennessee, which acquirers’
mobile homes and mobile home parks and either sells them or rents the homes to individual families. The acquisition of mobile homes
or mobile home parks allows AHI to provide an alternative to traditional housing, which is a popular option for a homeowner wishing to
avoid large down payments, expensive maintenance costs, monthly mortgage payments and high property taxes. The typical arrangement with
potential buyers is a lease-to-own arrangement on an individual home. The fundamentals of that arrangement obligate the tenant(s) to
the terms of the lease with AHI retaining ownership. In addition, the tenant(s) pay non-refundable option monies prior to the start of
the lease. This option consideration enables them to purchase the home at the end of the lease if they choose. A typical lease is 7 years.
We have found that most tenants move out before the end of that period and thus never satisfy the terms that would enable them to purchase
the home.
Edge View Properties, Inc. (“Edge View”),
which we acquired on July 16, 2014, is a real estate company that owns 30 acres of land; 23.5 acres zoned MDR (Medium Density Residential)
with 12 lots already platted and 48 lots zoned HDR (High Density Residential), 4 acres of dedicated river front property zoned for recreation
on the Salmon River, Idaho’s premier whitewater river and 2.5 acres zoned for commercial use. All the land is in the city limits
of Salmon and adjacent to the Frank church Wilderness Park (the largest wilderness park in the lower 48 states). Edge View’s plan
is to enter into a joint venture agreement with a developer for construction of single-family homes on the property. The Company has
yet to enter into a joint venture agreement for the development of single-family homes.
31
Platinum Tax Defenders, LLC (“Platinum
Tax”),
which we acquired on July 31, 2018, is a full-service tax resolution firm located in Los Angeles, CA.  Since 2011,
Platinum Tax has been assisting all types of taxpayers resolve any and all issues with IRS and applicable state tax agencies. Platinum
Tax provides fee-based tax resolution services to individuals and companies that have federal and state tax liabilities by assisting
its clients to settle outstanding tax debts. Specifically, the Platinum Tax teams tax relief services include but are not limited to,
back taxes, offer in compromise, audit representation, amending tax returns, tax preparation, tax resolution, wage garnishment relief,
removal of bank levies and liens, bookkeeping, and other financial challenges. Platinum Tax has a team of 28 which includes tax attorneys,
accountants, and enrolled agents that have an aggregate of more than 90 years of experience in the financial services industry and have
resolved tax issues for thousands of clients.
Nova Ortho and Spine, PLLC (“Nova Ortho”)
which we acquired on May 31, 2021 is a company in which doctors provides a full range of diagnostic and surgical services for injuries
and disorders of the skeletal system and associated bones, joints, tendons, muscles, ligaments, and nerves. From sports injuries, to
sprains, strains, and fractures, our doctors are dedicated to helping you return to your active lifestyle. Orthopedic and pain procedure
services include hip and knee replacement, shoulder reconstruction, fracture care and hand surgery, as well as spinal surgery in the
State of Florida.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak of a novel coronavirus throughout
the world, including the United States, since early calendar year 2020 through current, has caused widespread business and economic disruption
through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (“COVID-19 Pandemic”).
We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response
to the COVID-19 Pandemic is rapidly evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where the Company operates.
It is expected that the Company's customers and suppliers may well continue to be impacted which could materially and adversely affect
the Company. Our ability to obtain or deliver inventory or services, and our ability to collect accounts receivables as customers may
be affected
The financial services segments of the economy
was adversely affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Due to the IRS prolonging individual tax filings, this affected our tax resolution businesses
and management decided to divest JM Enterprise 1, Inc. (Key Tax Group). The Company’s tax resolution business operations have been
hard hit by the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent directives and responses to this crisis taken by the IRS,
federal, state, and local governments. Management will continue to monitor its businesses and focus our growth primarily in the health
industry.

The outbreak of the coronavirus throughout the
world, including the United States, during early calendar year 2020 has caused widespread business and economic disruption through mandated
and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (“COVID-19 Pandemic”). Due to the
IRS prolonging individual tax filings, this affected our tax resolution businesses in 2021 and management decided to divest JM Enterprise
1, Inc. (Key Tax Group). The Company’s tax resolution business operations have been hard hit by the economic pressure of the COVID-19
pandemic and the subsequent directives and responses to this crisis taken by the IRS, federal, state, and local governments. Considering
these circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company, as a public reporting company, must evaluate what the Company should
and are obligated to do in order to protect shareholders.
The outbreak of a novel coronavirus throughout
the world, including the United States, since early calendar year 2020 through current, has caused widespread business and economic disruption
through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (“COVID-19 Pandemic”).
We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response
to the COVID-19 Pandemic is rapidly evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where the Company operates.
It is expected that the Company's customers and suppliers may well continue to be impacted which could materially and adversely affect
the Company. Our ability to obtain or deliver inventory or services, and our ability to collect accounts receivables as customers may
be affected
The financial services segments of the economy
was adversely affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Management will continue to monitor its businesses and focus our growth primarily in
the health industry.
The Company raised $729,083 in convertible notes
during the Nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation will negatively
impact our business plans.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, the principal sources of cash
have been funds raised from (i) debenture convertible notes and conventional notes payable, (ii) the sale of common stock and pre ferred
stock, and (iii) advances from shareholders. At September 30, 2022, we had $260,498 in cash, a working capital deficit of $2,539,506 and
total assets of $15,958,345 and total liabilities of $9,908,290.
Net cash used in operating activities was $414,252
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the net loss of $850,454, an
increase in accounts receivable of $1,858,494, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $315,123. The negative
cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarily to the loss of 2,810,930, an increase in accounts receivable
of $114,399, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $594,276 and an increase in accrued interest of 321,468.
Net cash used in investing activities was $-0-
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The cash used in investing activities of $2,323,642 for the nine months ended September
30, 2021 was for the acquisition of Nova Ortho and Spine.
Net cash provided by financing activities was
$407,480 and $3,766,960 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The positive cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to proceeds from convertible notes of $729,083, offset by the payment of dividends of $310,522.
The positive cash flows for the Nine months ended September 30, 2021 were primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock
of $3,000,000 for the purchase of Nova Ortho and proceeds from SBA / PPP loans of $347,050.

There can be no assurance that we will be able
to obtain sufficient capital from debt or equity transactions or from operations in the necessary time frame or on terms acceptable to
us. Should we be unable to raise sufficient funds, we may be required to curtail our operating plans and possibly relinquish rights to
portions of our technology or services provided. In addition, increases in expenses may adversely impact our cash position and may require
cost reductions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future.
In order to continue our operations and implementation
of our business plan, we need additional financing. We are currently attempting to obtain additional working capital in an equity transaction.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of September 30, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
for timely decisions regarding disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer has concluded
that these disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective. There have been no changes to our disclosure controls and procedures during
the Nine months ended September 30, 2022.
There has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting during the Nine months ended September 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Since the most recent evaluation date, there have been no significant changes in
our internal control structure, policies, and procedures or in other areas that could significantly affect our internal control over financial
reporting.
(b)
Changes in Internal Controls
There were no significant changes in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the
date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
There have been no events under any bankruptcy act, any criminal proceedings
nor any judgments or injunctions material to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director or executive officer during the
last five years.
Cardiff and its
subsidiaries are parties in a few legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking
to establish liability directly through tax resolution contracts or rental property defaults.  We do not believe that such normal
and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cardiff parent is also involved
in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any
liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition
or results of operations.
