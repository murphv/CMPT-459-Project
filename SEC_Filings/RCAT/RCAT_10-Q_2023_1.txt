not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the
financial information included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 of Red Cat Holdings, Inc. (the
"Company"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on July 27, 2022.
Note 1 – The Business
Red Cat Holdings (“Red Cat” or the “Company”)
was originally incorporated in February 1984. Since April 2016, the Company’s primary business has been to provide products, services
and solutions to the drone industry which it presently does through its four wholly owned subsidiaries. Teal Drones is a leader in commercial
and government Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology. Fat Shark is a provider of First Person View (FPV) video goggles to the drone
industry. Rotor Riot sells FPV drones and equipment to the consumer marketplace through its digital storefront located at www.rotorriot.com.
Skypersonic provides software and hardware solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS (global
positioning systems) is not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away.
Corporate developments since May 1, 2021 include:
A.
Fat Shark Acquisition
On September 30, 2020, the
Company entered into a share purchase agreement (“Share Purchase Agreement”) with Greg French (“French”), the
founder and sole shareholder of Fat Shark Holdings (“Fat Shark”), to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Fat
Shark and its subsidiaries. The transaction closed on November 2, 2020 and was valued at $ 8,354,076
based on (i) the issuance
of
5,227,273
shares of common stock with a value of $ 6,351,076
on the date of closing (ii) a senior secured promissory note in the original principal
amount of $ 1,753,000 , and (iii) a cash payment of $ 250,000 . The Share Purchase Agreement included indemnification provisions, a two year
non-compete agreement, and registration rights for the shares issued in the transaction.
A summary of the purchase

name is not being amortized but is reviewed quarterly and formally evaluated at year end. The excess of the purchase price above the net
assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is reviewed quarterly and formally evaluated at year end.
B.
Skypersonic Acquisition
In May 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Skypersonic, Inc. (“Skypersonic”) in exchange for $3,000,000 of our common stock. The number of shares issuable was
based on the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of our common stock for the 20 trading days ending May 7, 2021. Based on
a VWAP of $4.0154, the Company issued
747,124
shares. In addition, the Company also agreed to issue
110,000
shares of common stock to
a shareholder. For accounting purposes, the
857,124
shares were valued at $ 3,291,356
based on the closing price of our common stock of $ 3.84
on May 7, 2021. Prior to the closing, the Company provided $ 75,000
to Skypersonic to fund its operating costs. This amount was capitalized
as part of the purchase price. In October 2021, the Company and Skypersonic agreed to a reduction in the purchase price of $ 601,622
which resulted in the cancellation of
149,829
shares held in escrow.
The final summary of the purchase price and its related

C.
Teal Drones Acquisition
On August 31, 2021, the Company closed the acquisition
of Teal Drones Inc., (“Teal”). Under the terms of the agreement, the base purchase price of $ 14,000,000
was
reduced by $ 1,670,294
of debt assumed by the Company, as well as a working capital deficit adjustment of $ 1,456,953 . Based on the net amount payable of $ 10,872,753 , and a VWAP of $2.908 for the twenty trading days ending August 31, 2022, the Company issued
3,738,911
of common stock. For accounting
purposes, the shares were valued at $ 10,431,562
based on the closing price of our common stock of $ 2.79
on August 31, 2021. In December
2021, the Company and Teal agreed to a reduction in the purchase price of $ 438,058
which resulted in the cancellation of
150,639
shares
held in escrow. The Stock Consideration may be increased if Teal attains certain revenue levels in the 24-month period following the
closing.  The additional consideration begins at $4 million if sales total at least $18 million and ends at $16 million if sales
total $36 million.

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial and
Other Information
There is no pro forma financial information for the
nine months ended January 31, 2023 because all acquisitions had closed prior to the beginning of the reporting period. The following table
presents pro forma results as if our acquisition of Teal had occurred on May 1, 2021:

The acquisition of Skypersonic was completed
on May 7, 2021 and its activities during the period from May 1, 2021 to May 7, 2021 were immaterial to the consolidated pro forma results.
The unaudited pro forma financial information
has been compiled in a manner consistent with the Company's accounting policies, and includes transaction costs, amortization of the
acquired intangible assets, and other expenses directly related to each respective acquisition.  The unaudited pro forma financial
information is based on estimates and assumptions which the Company believes are reasonable and are not necessarily indicative of the
results that would have been realized had the acquisitions closed on the dates indicated in the tables, nor are they indicative of results
of operations that may occur in the future.
Other information related
to the Company’s acquisitions include:
•
The purchase price allocation has been finalized for each acquisition based on the report from the valuation services firm engaged to assist in the identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired.
•
The fair value of shares issued by the Company as part of the consideration paid is normally based on the volume weighted average price of the Company’s common stock for the twenty days prior to the closing of the transaction.  For accounting purposes, the shares issued are valued based on the closing stock price on the date that the transaction closes.
10
•
Goodwill for Rotor Riot relates to its strong social media presence including more than 200,000 YouTube subscribers. Goodwill for Fat Shark is attributable to its relationship with manufacturing sources in China and the potential to integrate its goggle technologies with the Teal drone.  Goodwill for Skypersonic relates to the future customers expected to leverage its “Fly Anywhere” technologies in a wide range of commercial environments.  Goodwill for Teal is ascribed to its existing relationship with several U.S. government agencies including its classification as an approved vendor.
•
The Company expects that the Goodwill recognized in each transaction will be deductible for tax purposes.  The Company has reported net losses since its inception and is presently unable to determine when and if the tax benefit of this deduction will be realized.
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Basis of Accounting
– The financial statements
and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).
Certain prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the current year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
– Our consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, which consist of Teal Drones, Fat Shark, Rotor Riot,
and Skypersonic. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
– The preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates reflected
in these financial statements include those used to (i) determine stock-based compensation, (ii) complete purchase price accounting for
acquisitions,
(iii) accounting for derivatives, and (iv) reserves and allowances related to accounts receivable and inventory.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
– At January
31, 2023, we had cash of $3,893,162 in multiple commercial banks and financial services companies. We have not experienced any loss on
these cash balances and believe they are not exposed to any significant credit risk.
Marketable Securities
– Our marketable
securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale securities. These securities are primarily invested in corporate
bonds and are readily saleable, and therefore, we have classified them as short term. Our available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value with any unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of comprehensive income (loss). Once realized, any gains or losses
are recognized in the statement of operations.
We have elected to present accrued interest income
separately from marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Accrued interest income was $233,471 and $385,730 as of January
31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively, and was included in other current assets. We did not write off any accrued interest income
during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.
Accounts Receivable, net
– Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful
accounts is based on a multitude of factors, including historical bad debt levels for its customer base, past experience with a specific
customer, the economic environment, and other factors. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance when it is
probable that the receivable will not be collected.
Inventories  – Inventories,
which consist of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and are
measured using the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials and direct labor, as well as in-bound freight.
At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence.
11
Goodwill
– Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price of an acquisition over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. The measurement period for
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of
the acquisition date becomes known, not to exceed 12 months. Adjustments in a purchase price allocation may require a change in the amounts
allocated to goodwill during the periods in which an adjustment is determined.
We perform an impairment test at the end of each fiscal
year, or more frequently if indications of impairment arise. We have two business segments and evaluate goodwill for impairment based
on an evaluation of the fair value of each business segment individually.
Property and equipment
–
Property and
equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of the asset. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally: (i) furniture and fixtures - seven years, (ii) equipment
and related - two to five years, and (iii) leasehold improvements - 15 years.
Leases
–
Effective August 1, 2021, the
Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842 titled “Leases” which requires the recognition of assets and liabilities
associated with lease agreements. The Company adopted ASC 842 on a modified retrospective transition basis which means that it did not
restate financial information for any periods prior to August 1, 2021. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a lease liability obligation
of $796,976 and a right-of-use asset for the same amount.
The Company determines if
a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception.  Operating lease liabilities are measured, on each reporting date, based
on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term.  The Company's leases do not provide an
implicit rate. Therefore, the Company uses an effective discount rate of 12% based on its last debt financing. Operating lease
assets are measured by adjusting the lease liability for lease incentives, initial direct costs incurred and asset impairments.
Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the operating lease asset reduced
by the amount of the expense. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when they are reasonably certain to occur.
Fair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for
Financial Assets and Liabilities, and Related Disclosures
– The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance defines fair
value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance
with this guidance, the Company has categorized its recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy
based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the
fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input
to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The guidance establishes
three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:
Level 1 :
Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
Level 2 :
Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and
Level 3 :
Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little
or no market data.
12
Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets Measured at
Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
The Company's financial instruments mainly consist
of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, current
assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Convertible Securities and Derivatives
When the Company issues convertible debt or equity
instruments that contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds
from the convertible host instruments are first allocated to the bifurcated derivative instruments.  The remaining proceeds,
if any, are then allocated to the convertible instruments themselves, resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from
their face value but no lower than zero. Any excess amount is recognized as a derivative expense.
Derivative Liabilities
The Company has financial instruments that are considered
derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument
and are recognized as liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. The Company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value
and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change.
In October 2020 and January 2021, the Company entered
into convertible note agreements which included provisions under which the conversion price was equal to the lesser of an initial stated
amount or the conversion price of a future offering. This variable conversion feature was recognized as a derivative. Both financings
included the issuance of warrants which contained similar variable conversion features. The Company values these convertible notes and
warrants using the multinomial lattice method that values the derivative liability based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow
model. The resulting liability is valued at each reporting date and the change in the liability is reflected as change in derivative liability
in the statement of operations.
Revenue Recognition
– The Company
recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”). This standard includes a comprehensive evaluation of factors to be considered regarding revenue
recognition including (i) identifying the promised goods, (ii) evaluating performance obligations, (iii) measuring the transaction price,
(iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations if there are multiple components, and (v) recognizing revenue as
each obligation is satisfied.  The Company’s revenue transactions include a single component, specifically, the shipment of
goods to customers as orders are fulfilled. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment. The timing of the shipment of orders can vary
considerably depending upon whether an order is for an item normally maintained in inventory or an order that requires assembly or unique
parts. Customer deposits totaled $219,148 and $437,930 at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively.
Research and Development
– Research and
development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research
and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, as well as a proportionate share of overhead costs
such as rent. Costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until technological feasibility is
reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility
is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized as a cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
Income Taxes
– Deferred taxes are provided
on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities
are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on
the date of enactment.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
– Management
does not believe that recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency
–
The functional currency
of our international subsidiary is the local currency. For that subsidiary, we translate assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using
period-end exchange rates, and average monthly exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses
in accumulated other comprehensive income.
13
Comprehensive Loss
– Comprehensive loss
consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an element
of stockholders' equity and are excluded from net loss. Our other comprehensive loss is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments
and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, comprehensive
loss was $328,226 lower and $2,158 lower than net loss, respectively, related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities totaling
$328,006 and $0, respectively, as well as by foreign currency translation adjustments of $220 and $2,158.
Stock-Based Compensation
– For stock
options, we use the estimated grant-date fair value method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock
Compensation. Fair value is determined based on the Black-Scholes Model using inputs reflecting our estimates of expected volatility,
term and future dividends. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. For restricted stock, we determine the fair value based on our stock
price on the date of grant. For both stock options and restricted stock, we recognize compensation costs on a straight-line basis over
the service period which is the vesting term.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share
–
Basic and diluted net loss per share has been calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock
because they were anti-dilutive. The conversion or exercise of these common stock equivalents would dilute earnings per share if we become
profitable in the future.
Outstanding securities not included in the computation
of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive included the following:

Related Parties
– Parties are considered
to be related to us if they have control or significant influence, directly or indirectly, over us, including key management personnel
and members of the Board of Directors. Related Party transactions are disclosed in Note 20.
Segment Reporting
Since January 2020, we have acquired four separate
businesses operating in various aspects of the drone industry. Following the most recent acquisition, the Company focused on integrating
and organizing its acquired businesses. These efforts included refining the establishment of Enterprise and Consumer segments to sharpen
the Company’s focus on the unique opportunities in each sector of the drone industry. The Enterprise segment, which includes Teal
Drones and Skypersonic, is focused on opportunities in the commercial sector, including military. Enterprise is building the infrastructure
to manage drone fleets, fly and provide services remotely, and navigate confined industrial interior spaces and dangerous military environments.
The Consumer segment, which includes Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, is focused on enthusiasts and hobbyists which are expected to increase
as drones become more visible in our daily lives. Effective May 1, 2022, we began to manage our business operations through these business
segments. The reportable segments were identified based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is a committee
comprised of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) and our Chief Financial Officer
(“CFO”), manages our business, makes resource allocation and operating decisions, and evaluates operating performance. See
“Note 21 - Segment Reporting”.

Note 6 – Due From Related Party
In January 2022, the Company determined that an employee
had relocated in 2021 but their compensation had not been subject to the income tax withholding required by the new jurisdiction. The
amount subject to taxation included $ 155,624  of
cash compensation and $ 1,413,332  of income associated with the vesting of restricted
stock ("Stock Compensation"). In March 2022, the Company entered into a note agreement (the "Note") with the
employee in the amount of $ 510,323 , representing the estimated taxes owed by the employee related to the Stock Compensation. Under the
terms of the Note,
104,166
shares of common stock with a fair value of $ 280,832 ,
which had vested during calendar 2021, were withheld
by the Company and applied against the Note. The employee agreed not to sell or transfer
110,983  shares of common stock held
at the Company's transfer agent until the Note was repaid. In addition, the employee has
20,833  shares of restricted stock vesting
monthly in calendar 2022, of which
3,000
shares will be withheld with the fair value of those shares applied against the Note.
Any shares issued to the employee in 2022 will be held at the transfer agent until the Note is repaid in full. The Note matures on
December 31, 2022. The Company filed amended payroll tax returns on March 16, 2022. In March and April 2022, the Company made payments
to the relevant tax authorities totaling $ 712,646  representing
$ 510,323
owed by the employee, $ 31,604
owed by the Company, and $ 170,719
of penalties and interest. The Note was repaid in full in August 2022.

Note 13 – Convertible Notes
October 2020 Financing
In October 2020, the Company closed a private offering
of convertible promissory notes (the "2020 Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $ 600,000 . The 2020 Notes accrued interest
at
12 % annually, had a two-year term, and were convertible into common stock at the lower of $1.00 or a 25% discount of the price per
share of Common Stock offered in a future, qualified offering. The financing also included the issuance of warrants to purchase
399,998
shares of common stock. The Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years at a price equal to the lower of (1) $1.50 per share,
or (2) at a price equal to 75% of the price per share of the common stock offered in a future, qualified offering.
The Company determined that the provision associated
with a potential reduction in the conversion price of the notes and the exercise price of the warrant represented an embedded derivative
financial liability. The derivative liability was initially valued at $ 728,587
using a multinomial lattice model with $ 460,588
and $ 267,999
related to the derivative features of the notes and warrants, respectively. In addition, $ 580,000
of the proceeds were applied as a debt
discount to reduce the initial carrying value of the 2020 Notes to zero with the remaining $ 20,000
applied against transaction fees. The
excess of the liability over the net proceeds totaled $ 148,587
which was recognized as a derivative expense in the fiscal year ended April
30, 2021.
As of January 31, 2023, (a) the 2020 Notes were fully
converted into common stock and the related derivative liability eliminated, and (b)
266,666
of the warrants were outstanding with a derivative
liability of $ 273,196 .
January 2021 Financing
In January 2021, the Company closed a private offering
of convertible promissory notes (the "2021 Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $ 500,000 . The 2021 Notes accrued interest
at
12 % annually, had a two-year term, and were convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at the lower of $1.00 or a 25% discount
of the price per share of Common Stock offered in a future, qualified offering. The financing also included the issuance of warrants to
purchase
675,000
shares of common stock. The Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years at a price equal to the lower of (i)
$1.50 per share, or (ii) a 25% discount to the price per share of common stock offered in a future qualified offering.
20
The Company determined that the provision associated
with a potential reduction in the conversion price of the notes and the exercise price of the warrant represented an embedded derivative
financial liability. The derivative liability was initially valued at $ 4,981,701
using a multinomial lattice model with $ 2,111,035
and
$ 2,870,666
related to the derivative features of the notes and warrants, respectively. In addition, $ 500,000
was applied as a debt discount
to reduce the initial carrying value of the 2021 notes to zero. The excess of the liability over the net proceeds totaled $ 4,481,701
which
was recognized as a derivative expense in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021.
As of January 31, 2023, (a) the 2021 Notes were fully
converted into common stock and the related derivative liability eliminated, and (b)
540,000
of the warrants were outstanding with a derivative
liability of $ 582,904 .
Note 14 – Income Taxes
Our operating subsidiary, Red Cat Propware, Inc.,
is incorporated and based in Puerto Rico which is a commonwealth of the United States. We are not subject to taxation by the United States
as Puerto Rico has its own taxing authority. Since inception, we have incurred net losses in each year of operations. Our current provision
for the reporting periods presented in these financial statements consisted of a tax benefit against which we applied a full valuation
allowance, resulting in no current provision for income taxes. In addition, there was no deferred provision for any of these reporting
periods.
At January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, we
had accumulated deficits of approximately $ 43,000,000
and $ 27,500,000 ,
respectively. Deferred tax assets related to the future benefit of these net operating losses for tax purposes totaled approximately
$ 7,955,000
and $ 5,087,500 ,
respectively, calculated using the base Puerto Rico corporate tax rate of 18.5%. Currently, we focus on projected future
taxable income in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that these deferred assets will be realized. Based on the fact that
we have not generated an operating profit since inception, we have applied a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022.
Note 15 – Common Stock
Our common stock has a par value of $ 0.001
per share.
We are authorized to issue
500,000,000

Note 17 – Warrants
The company issued five-year warrants in connection
with two convertible note financings. The warrants have an initial exercise price of $ 1.50
which may be reduced to a 25% discount of the
price per share of Common Stock offered in a future qualified offering. The warrants were valued using the multinominal lattice model
and are considered derivative liabilities under ASC 815-40. The value of the warrants was included in the determination of the initial
accounting for each financing including the calculation of the derivative liability and related expense.

$ 99,999
in connection with the exercise of
66,666
warrants which resulted in the elimination of $ 163,141
of the derivative liability in
the warrants.
In May 2021, the Company issued warrants to purchase

Note 19 – Derivatives
The Company completed financings in October 2020
and January 2021 which included notes and warrants containing embedded features subject to derivative accounting. See Note 13 for a full
description of these financings. Both the notes and the warrants included provisions which provided for a reduction in the conversion
and exercise prices, respectively, if the Company completed a future qualified offering at a lower price. These provisions represent embedded
derivatives which are valued separately from the host instrument (meaning the notes and warrants) and recognized as derivative liabilities
on the Company's balance sheet. The Company initially measures these financial instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes
changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change. The Company also measures these financial
instruments on the date of settlement (meaning when the note is converted, or the warrant is exercised) at their estimated fair value
and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations. Any discount in the carrying value of the note is fully
amortized on the date of settlement and recognized as interest expense. The Company estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives
using a multinomial lattice model. The range of underlying assumptions used in the binomial model to determine the fair value of the derivative
warrant liability upon settlement of the derivative liability and as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022 are set forth below. In addition,
the Company's stock price on each measurement date was used in the model.

price reducing the liability.
Note 20 - Related-Party Transactions
In July 2021, the Company entered into a consulting
agreement with a director resulting in monthly payments of $ 6,000 . In addition, the Company issued
150,000
options to purchase common
stock at $ 2.51

the monthly payments to $ 10,000 . The agreement expired in June 2022.
In January 2022, the Company entered into a note agreement
with an employee in the principal amount of $510,323, as further described in Note 6.
Additional related party transactions are disclosed
in Note 12.
Note 21 - Segment Reporting
We define our segments as those operations whose
results are regularly reviewed by our CODM to analyze performance and allocate resources. Therefore, segment information is prepared
on the same basis that management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Our CODM is a committee comprised
of our CEO, COO, and CFO.
The Enterprise segment is focused on opportunities
in the commercial sector, including military. Enterprise is building the infrastructure to manage drone fleets, fly and provide services
remotely, and navigate confined industrial interior spaces and dangerous military environments.
The Consumer segment is focused on enthusiasts and
hobbyists which are expected to increase as drones become more visible in our daily lives.
25
Our CODM allocates
resources to and assesses the performance of our two operating segments based on the operating segments’ net sales and gross profit.

Subsequent Events
Subsequent events have

Sale of Consumer Segment
On November 21, 2022, the
Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") with Unusual Machines, Inc. (“UM”) and Jeffrey
Thompson, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the “Principal Stockholder”), related to the sale of
the Company’s consumer business consisting of Rotor Riot, (“RR”), and Fat Shark Holdings (“FS”), for
$18 million in cash and securities of UM.
26
The purchase price consists
of (i) $5 million in cash (as increased for positive working capital and decreased for negative working capital at closing) plus (ii)
$2.5 million in a convertible senior note of UM (the “Senior Note”) plus (iii) $10.5 million in Series A convertible preferred
stock of UM (the “Series A Stock”).  The Senior Note and Series A Stock will be convertible into Common Stock at the
lesser of $4.00 per share or the IPO price of UM. The Senior Note and Series A Stock shall contain beneficial ownership blockers under
which conversion shall be limited to 4.99% and/or 9.99% of the total voting power of UM, and may be further subject to limitations on
voting and conversion required in order to conform with requirements of NASDAQ related to the issuance of more than 19.99% of the outstanding
Common Stock in accordance with NASDAQ Rule 5635(d). The Senior Note and Series A Stock will include anti-dilution protection in the case
of issuances by UM at a price lower than the then applicable conversion price for so long as the Senior Note or Series A Stock remains
outstanding under which the conversion price will be reduced to such lower price.
Under the terms of the SPA the Principal Stockholder
and UM have agreed to indemnification obligations which shall survive for a period of 9 months, subject to certain limitations, which
includes a basket of $250,000 before any claim can be asserted and a cap equal to the value of the escrow shares, other than in cases
involving fraud. The Principal Stockholder agreed to deposit 450,000 shares of UM common stock owned to secure any indemnification obligations.
The closing of the SPA, is
subject to customary conditions including shareholder approval by a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the Company. The Principal
Stockholder, who holds approximately 24% of the voting power of the Company, shall abstain from the vote on approval of the SPA. On November
21, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the SPA and its submission to shareholders for approval. In addition, closing
of the SPA is subject to successful completion of an initial public offering (the “IPO”) by UM in the minimum amount of $15
million, and the listing of UM’s common stock on NASDAQ. The SPA requires the Company to cooperate with UM in connection with the
IPO and to deliver audited financial statements of RR and FS. UM has agreed to register all of the common stock for which the Senior Note
is convertible in the IPO for resale by the Company, or to pay the note in full with proceeds of the offering at closing, at UM’s
election. In addition, UM has agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement for 100% of the common stock for which the Series A
Stock may be converted and to use its best efforts to file and have declared effective such registration statement, on demand and on a
piggy-back basis in connection with any other registration statements filed by UM.

Recent Developments
Corporate developments during the two years ended
January 31, 2023 include:
Capital Transactions
S-1
Offering
On May 4, 2021, the Company
closed a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the "S-1 Offering") for the sale of 4,000,000 shares of common stock,
at a public offering price of $4.00 per share, to ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., as representative of
the underwriters ("ThinkEquity"), pursuant to an underwriting agreement with Think Equity. The shares were sold pursuant
to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-253491), filed with the SEC, which was declared effective
by the Commission on April 29, 2021 (the "S-1 Registration Statement"). The S-1 offering generated gross proceeds of $16
million and net proceeds of approximately $14.6 million.
S-3
Offering
On July 21, 2021 the Company
closed a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the "S-3 Offering") for the sale of 13,333,334 shares of common
stock at a purchase price of $4.50 per share to ThinkEquity. The shares were sold pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3,
as amended (File No. 333-256216), filed with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on June 14, 2021 and a Supplement to
the Prospectus contained in a registration statement filed with the SEC on July 19, 2021. The S-3 offering generated gross proceeds
of $60 million and net proceeds of approximately $55.5 million.
Plan of Operations
Since April 2016, the Company's primary
business has been to provide products, services, and solutions to the drone industry which it presently does through its four wholly owned
subsidiaries. Beginning in January 2020, the Company expanded the scope of its drone products and services through four acquisitions,
including:
A.
In January 2020, the Company acquired Rotor Riot, a provider of First Person View (FPV) drones and equipment, primarily to the consumer marketplace. The purchase price was $1,995,114.
B.
In November 2020, the Company acquired Fat Shark Holdings, a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was $8,354,076.
28
C.
In May 2021, the Company acquired Skypersonic which provides hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS is not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was $2,791,012.
D.
In August 2021, the Company acquired Teal Drones, a leader in commercial and government UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) technology. The purchase price was $10,011,279.
Following
the Teal acquisition, we focused on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise
and Consumer segments in order to sharpen our focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. The Enterprise segment, which includes
Teal Drones and Skypersonic, is focused on opportunities in the commercial sector, including military. Enterprise is building the
infrastructure to manage drone fleets, fly and provide services remotely, and navigate confined industrial interior spaces and dangerous
military environments. The Consumer segment, which includes Fat Shark and Rotor Riot, is focused on hobbyists and enthusiasts which
are expected to increase as drones become more visible in our daily lives.
In November
2021, we entered into an agreement to sell our Consumer segment to Unusual Machines for total consideration of $18 million, including
$5 million in cash, at closing, and $13 million in securities of Unusual Machines. The Company has determined to focus its efforts
and capital on military and defense where it believes that there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value. The transaction
is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2023 but is contingent upon Unusual Machines completing (i) an initial public offering
that raises sufficient capital to close the transaction, and (ii) a listing of its common stock on Nasdaq. There can be no assurances
that the transaction will successfully close.
Results of Operations
The analysis
of the Company's results of operations for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended
January 31, 2022 is significantly impacted by the acquisition of Teal Drones on August 31, 2021. Teal is the Company’s largest operating
subsidiary. Since acquiring Teal, the Company has more than tripled the number of employees and significantly expanded its facilities. As
a result, the comparison of the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022
yields more significant changes than might normally occur.
Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 and January
31, 2022
Revenues
Revenues totaled $3,106,644 during
the three months ended January 31, 2023 (or the "2023 period") compared to $1,856,751 for the three months ended January 31,
2022 (or the "2022 period"), representing an increase of $1,249,893, or 67%. Consumer revenues totaled $1,438,961 during the
2023 period compared to $1,026,978 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $411,983, or 40%. Fat Shark launched its newest
product, the Dominator, in the first fiscal quarter during which the Consumer segment generated record quarterly revenues.  Fat Shark
revenues totaled $529,394 during the 2023 period compared to $432,529 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $96,865, or
22%.  Enterprise revenues totaled $1,667,683 during the 2023 period compared to $829,773 during the 2022 period, resulting in
an increase of $837,910, or 101%. This increase primarily related to Teal, which launched the Teal 2 during the 2023 period. Teal accounted
for nearly 100% of Enterprise revenues during the 2023 period.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of Goods totaled $3,004,032 in
the 2023 period compared to $1,516,970 in the 2022 period, representing an increase of $1,487,062, or 98%. The increase directly related
to higher revenues which increased by 67% in the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period.
29
Gross Margin
Gross margin
totaled $102,612 during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $339,781 during the three months ended January 31, 2022, representing
a decrease of $237,169, or approximately 70%. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 3% during the 2023 period compared to 18% during
the 2022 period. The percentage basis decrease primarily related to Teal which realized lower margins in the 2023 period related to the
launch of the Teal 2 and corresponding disposal of obsolete inventory used exclusively for the Golden Eagle.
Operating Expenses
Operations
expense totaled $815,170 during the 2023 period compared to $334,278 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $480,892, or
greater than 100%. Approximately 98% of the increase, or $469,212, related to Teal which was acquired on August 31, 2021.  Since
acquiring Teal, we have more than tripled its headcount and expanded its facilities. Approximately 45% of Teal's costs related to payroll,
16% to employee-related office expenses, 21% to professional fees with the balance spread ratably across numerous categories including
travel, meals, overhead, and information technology.
Research
and development expenses totaled $1,302,008 during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $811,288 during the three months
ended January 31, 2022, representing an increase of 490,720, or 60%. Substantially all of the increase related to Teal which was acquired
on August 31, 2021.  Since acquiring Teal, we have more than tripled its headcount and expanded its facilities.  Approximately
24% of Teal's expenses related to payroll with 36% related to office, and 32% related to professional fees.
Sales and marketing costs totaled
$1,208,037 during the 2023 period compared to $238,624 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $969,413, or greater than 100%. Payroll
costs totaled $417,810 in the 2023 period compared to $164,326 resulting in an increase of $253,484 which represented 26% of the total
increase in sales and marketing costs. Advertising and Show Production totaled $348,508 in the 2023 period compared to $61,978 resulting
in an increase of $286,530 which represented 30% of the total increase. Professional Fees totaled $280,061 in the 2023 period compared
to $6,642 resulting in an increase of $273,419 which represented 28% of the total increase.
General and administrative expenses
totaled $1,514,504 during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $1,337,183 during the three months ended January 31, 2022,
representing an increase of $177,321, or 13%. Payroll costs totaled $515,883 in the 2023 period compared to $410,640 in the 2022
period resulting in an increase of $105,243 or 59% of the total increase in general and administrative expenses. Legal and lobbying services
costs increased by $121,381 representing 68% of the total increase.
During the
three months ended January 31, 2023, we incurred stock-based compensation costs of $788,691 compared to $782,123 in the 2022 period,
resulting in an increase of 6,568 or 1%. Since the 2022 period, the Company has issued 623,000 additional options which resulted in incremental
stock based compensation costs of $99,706 in the 2023 period. In addition, costs related to restricted stock awards totaled $370,634
during the 2023 period compared to $313,925 during the 2022 period, representing an increase of $56,709, or 18%.
Other Income
Other expense totaled $140,204 during
the 2023 period compared to other income of $598,898 during the 2022 period, representing an increase of $739,102, which primarily related
to the change in fair value of derivative liability. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liability are most significantly impacted
by changes in the Company's stock price. A decrease in the stock price during both the 2023 and 2022 periods resulted in a decrease in
the carrying value of the liability, and therefore, the recognition of income. Income of $157,575 was recognized during the 2023 period
compared to income of $1,026,466 during the 2022 period, representing a decrease of $868,891.
30
Net Loss
Net Loss totaled $5,666,002 during
the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $2,564,817 during the three months ended January 31, 2022, representing an increase
of $3,101,185, or greater than 100%. The acquisition of Teal Drones on August 31, 2021 accounted for the majority of the increase. Since
acquiring Teal, we have more than tripled its headcount and significantly expanded its facilities. Net loss for Teal during the 2023 period
totaled $2,901,938 compared to $781,233 for the 2022 period, representing an increase of $2,120,705, or greater than 100%. The
higher net loss for Teal represented 68% of the increase in the consolidated net loss.
Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and January
31, 2022
Revenues
Revenues during the nine months ended
January 31, 2023 (or the "2023 period") totaled $7,706,377 compared to $5,116,741 for the nine months ended January 31, 2022
(or the "2022 period"), representing an increase of $2,589,636, or 51%. Consumer revenues totaled $4,164,531 during the 2023
period compared to $3,737,460 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $427,071, or 11%. Fat Shark revenues totaled $1,703,045
during the 2023 period compared to $2,228,552 during the 2022 period, resulting in a decrease of $525,507, or 24%.  Enterprise
revenues totaled $3,541,846 during the 2023 period compared to $1,379,281 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $2,162,565,
or greater than 100%. This increase primarily related to Teal, which launched its latest product, the Teal 2, during the 2023 period.
Teal accounted for 95% of Enterprise revenues during the 2023 period.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of Goods totaled $7,012,483 in
the 2023 period compared to $4,521,974 in the 2022 period, representing an increase of $2,490,509, or 55%. The increase directly related
to higher revenues which increased by 51% in the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period.
Gross Margin
Gross margin
totaled $693,894 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $594,767 during the nine months ended January 31, 2022, representing
an increase of $99,127, or 17%. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 9% during the 2023 period compared to 12% during the 2022 period.
The percentage basis decrease primarily related to Teal which realized lower margins in the 2023 period related to the launch of the Teal
2 and corresponding disposal of obsolete inventory used exclusively for the Golden Eagle. This obsolete inventory decreased gross margin
for Teal from 8% in the 2022 period to 2% in the 2023 period. The percentage basis decrease was partially offset by Fat Shark which
realized higher margins in the 2023 period related to the launch of its Dominator goggles compared to the 2022 period when it lowered
prices to expedite the sale of products near the end of their life cycle. These changes in product offerings increased gross margin for
Fat Shark from 2% in the 2022 period to 15% in the 2023 period.
Operating Expenses
Operations
expense totaled $3,616,129 during the 2023 period compared to $794,390 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $2,821,739,
or greater than 100%. Approximately 94% of the increase, or $2,645,431, related to Teal which was acquired on August 31, 2021. Since
its acquisition, we have more than tripled Teal's headcount and doubled the size of its facilities. Approximately 48% of Teal's costs
related to payroll, 22% to employee-related office expenses, and 11% to overhead expenses with the balance spread ratably across numerous
categories including information technology, facilities, professional fees, and travel.
Research
and development expenses totaled $3,189,692 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $1,548,983 during the nine months
ended January 31, 2022, representing an increase of $1,640,709, or greater than 100%. The entire increase can be attributed to Teal,
with approximately 41% its expenses related to payroll, 30% related to office, and 23% related to professional fees.
31
Sales and
marketing costs totaled $2,542,037 during the 2023 period compared to $524,642 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $2,017,395
or almost four times. Payroll costs, related to hiring at Teal, totaled $553,972 in the 2023 period compared to $19,993 during the
2022 period, resulting in an increase of $533,979 which represented 26% of the total increase in sales and marketing costs. Travel and
related costs totaled $369,901 in the 2023 period compared to $2,356 resulting in an increase of $367,545 which represented 18% of the
total increase. In addition, higher advertising and show production costs represented 22% of the increase while professional fees accounted
for 19%.
General and administrative expenses
totaled $4,551,706 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $3,264,071 during the nine months ended January 31, 2022,
representing an increase of $1,287,635, or 39%. Payroll costs totaled $1,638,765 in the 2023 period compared to $820,027 in the 2022
period resulting in an increase of $818,738 or 64% of the total increase in general and administrative expenses. Legal and lobbying services
costs increased by $388,204 representing 30% of the total increase.
During the nine months ended January
31, 2023, we incurred stock-based compensation costs of $2,790,958 compared to $2,066,146 in the 2022 period, resulting in an increase
of $724,812 or 35%.  Since the 2022 period, the Company has issued 623,000 additional options which resulted in incremental stock-based
compensation costs of $192,128 in the 2023 period. In addition, costs related to restricted stock awards totaled $1,482,190 during
the 2023 period compared to $1,092,127 during the 2022 period, resulting in an increase of $390,063 or 54% of the total increase in stock-based
compensation costs.
Other Income
Other income totaled $274,550 during
the 2023 period compared to $740,275 during the 2022 period, representing a decrease of $465,725, which primarily related to the change
in fair value of derivative liability. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liability are most significantly impacted by changes
in the Company's stock price. A decrease in the stock price during both the 2023 and 2022 periods resulted in a decrease in the carrying
value of the liability, and therefore, the recognition of income. Income of $751,397 was recognized during the 2023 period compared to
income of $1,299,527 during the 2022 period, representing a decrease of $548,130.
Net Loss
Net Loss totaled $15,722,078 during
the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $6,863,190 during the nine months ended January 31, 2022, representing an increase
of $8,858,888, or greater than 100%. The acquisition of Teal Drones in August 2021 accounted for the majority of the increase. Since
acquiring Teal, we have more than tripled its headcount and significantly expanded its facilities. Net loss for Teal during the
2023 period totaled $7,497,605 compared to $1,222,351 for the 2022 period, representing an increase of $6,275,254, or almost five
times. The higher net loss for Teal represented 71% of the increase in the consolidated net loss.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $21,394,858
during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $12,039,115 during the nine months
ended January 31, 2022, representing an increase of $9,355,743, or 78%. Net cash used in operations, net of non-cash expenses totaling
$2,752,691, equaled $12,969,387 in the 2023 period compared to $5,779,305, net of non-cash expenses totaling $1,083,885 in the 2022 period,
resulting in an increase of $7,190,082, or greater than 100%. The higher use of cash primarily related to the acquisition of Teal Drones
in August 2021 which resulted in a full nine months of operations in the 2023 period compared to five months of operations in the 2022
period.  Net cash used related to changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $8,425,471 during the nine months ended January
31, 2023, compared to $6,259,810 during the nine months ended January 31, 2022, representing an increase of $2,165,661 or 35%. Changes
in operating assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending upon the timing and level of multiple
factors, including inventory purchases and vendor payments.
32
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $22,296,235
during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $48,514,017 during the nine months
ended January 31, 2022 resulting in an increase of $70,810,252 or greater than 100%. During the 2023 period, net proceeds of $24,282,117
from the maturities of marketable securities were used to fund operations, and $1,735,882 was used to purchase property and equipment,
primarily related to the expansion of the manufacturing facilities for Teal. During the 2022 period, $54,696,624 of proceeds from stock
offerings were invested in marketable securities.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,093,030
during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $67,387,312 during the nine months
ended January 31, 2022. Financing activities can vary from period to period depending upon market conditions, both at a macro-level and
specific to the Company. During the 2022 period, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $70 million in connection with two
offerings of common stock.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At January 31, 2023, the Company reported current
assets totaling $40,527,873 current liabilities totaling $5,140,218 and net working capital of $35,387,655. Cash and marketable securities
totaled $24,623,195 at January 31, 2023. Inventory related balances, including pre-paid inventory, totaled $12,602,568. We continue
to maintain higher-than-normal inventory balances related to the global supply chain issues, including chip shortages, which have been
ongoing for more than a year. At January 31, 2023, the Company was in a strong liquidity and capital position relative to its operating
results for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 and its expected cash requirements for the next twelve months.
Going Concern
We only began generating revenues in January 2020
and have reported net losses since inception. We expect to report net losses for at least the next twelve months. To date, we have
funded our operations through debt and equity transactions. In May and July 2021, we completed common stock offerings which generated
gross proceeds of approximately $70 million. At January 31, 2023, we reported cash and investment balances of approximately $24.6
million. We expect these financial resources to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. However,
we can provide no assurance that these financial resources will be sufficient to fund our operations until we reach profitability.
If we are unable to become profitable before expending our current financial resources, we will need to raise additional capital through
equity or debt transactions. We can provide no assurance that such additional financing, if required, will be available to us on
acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to become profitable or obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition
and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods.
We regularly evaluate the
accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in
the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, information from third party
professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could
differ from those estimates made by management.
Significant estimates reflected in these financial
statements include those used to (i) determine stock-based compensation, (ii) complete purchase price accounting for acquisitions, (iii)
accounting for derivatives, and (iv) reserves and allowances related to accounts receivable and inventory.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements
that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and
the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
