SUBURBAN PROPANE PARTNERS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLI DATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(dollars in thousands, except unit and per unit amounts)
(unaudited)
1. Partnership Organization and Formation Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. (the “Partnership”) is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership principally engaged, through its operating partnership and subsidiaries, in the retail marketing and distribution of propane, renewable propane, fuel oil and refined fuels, as well as the marketing of natural gas and electricity in deregulated markets and investor in low-carbon fuel alternatives.
In addition, to complement its core marketing and distribution businesses, the Partnership services a wide variety of home comfort equipment, particularly for heating and ventilation.
The publicly traded limited partner interests in the Partnership are evidenced by common units traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“Common Units”), with
63,485,760
Common Units outstanding at December 24, 2022.
The holders of Common Units are entitled to participate in distributions and exercise the rights and privileges available to limited partners under the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”), as amended.
Rights and privileges under the Partnership Agreement include, among other things, the election of all members of the Board of Supervisors and voting on the removal of the general partner. Suburban Propane, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership, is the Partnership’s operating subsidiary formed to operate the propane business and assets.
In addition, Suburban Sales & Service, Inc. (the “Service Company”), a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, was formed to operate the service work and appliance and parts businesses of the Partnership.
The Operating Partnership, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, accounts for substantially all of the Partnership’s assets, revenues and earnings.
The Partnership, the Operating Partnership and the Service Company commenced operations in March 1996 in connection with the Partnership’s initial public offering. Suburban Renewable Energy, LLC (“Suburban Renewable Energy”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership that was formed in January 2022.
Suburban Renewable Energy serves as the platform for the Partnership’s investments in innovative, renewable energy technologies and businesses. The general partner of both the Partnership and the Operating Partnership is Suburban Energy Services Group LLC (the “General Partner”), a Delaware limited liability company, the sole member of which is the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer.
Other than as a holder of
784
Common Units that will remain in the General Partner, the General Partner does not have any economic interest in the Partnership or the Operating Partnership. The Partnership’s fuel oil and refined fuels, natural gas and electricity, services, and renewable energy businesses are structured as either limited liability companies that are treated as corporations or corporate entities (collectively referred to as the “Corporate Entities”) and, as such, are subject to corporate level U.S. income tax. Suburban Energy Finance Corp., a direct
100 %-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, was formed on November 26, 2003 to serve as co-issuer, jointly and severally with the Partnership, of the Partnership’s senior notes.
2. Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership, the Operating Partnership and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.
The Partnership consolidates the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Operating Partnership as a result of the Partnership’s
100 % limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
They include all adjustments that the Partnership considers necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods presented.
Such adjustments consist only of normal recurring items, unless otherwise disclosed.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.
Due to the seasonal nature of the Partnership’s operations, the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year.     6
Table of Contents Fiscal Period.
The Partnership uses a
52 / 53 -week fiscal year which ends on the last Saturday in September.
The Partnership’s fiscal quarters are generally
thirteen
weeks in duration.
When the Partnership’s fiscal year is 53 weeks long, as is the case for fiscal 2023, the corresponding fourth quarter is
fourteen
weeks in duration.
Revenue Recognition.
Revenue is recognized by the Partnership when goods or services promised in a contract with a customer have been transferred, and no further performance obligation on that transfer is required, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received.
Performance obligations are determined and evaluated based on the specific terms of the arrangements and the distinct products and services offered.
Due to the nature of the retail business of the Partnership, there are
no
remaining or unsatisfied performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period, except for tank rental agreements, maintenance service contracts, fixed price contracts and budgetary programs, as described below.
The performance obligation associated with sales of propane, fuel oil and refined fuels is met at the time product is delivered to the customer.
Revenue from the sale of appliances and equipment is recognized at the time of sale or when installation is complete, as defined by the performance obligations included within the related customer contract.
Revenue from repairs, maintenance and other service activities is recognized upon completion of the service.
Revenue from the sale of natural gas and electricity is recognized based on customer usage as determined by meter readings for amounts delivered, an immaterial amount of which may be unbilled at the end of each accounting period. The Partnership defers the recognition of revenue for annually billed tank rent, maintenance service contracts, fixed price contracts and budgetary programs where customer consideration is received at the start of the contract period, establishing contract liabilities which are disclosed as customer deposits and advances on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Deliveries to customers enrolled in budgetary programs that exceed billings to those customers establish contract assets which are included in accounts receivable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Partnership ratably recognizes revenue over the applicable term for tank rent and maintenance service agreements, which is generally
one year , and at the time of delivery for fixed price contracts and budgetary programs.
The Partnership incurs incremental direct costs, such as commissions to its salesforce, to obtain certain contracts.
These costs are expensed as incurred, consistent with the practical expedients issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), since the expected amortization period is one year or less.
The Partnership generally determines selling prices based on, among other things, the current weighted average cost and the current replacement cost of the product at the time of delivery, plus an applicable margin.
Except for tank rental agreements, maintenance service contracts, fixed price contracts and budgetary programs, customer payments for the satisfaction of a performance obligation are due upon receipt. Fair Value Measurements.
The Partnership measures certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants – in either the principal market or the most advantageous market.
The principal market is the market with the greatest level of activity and volume for the asset or liability. The common framework for measuring fair value utilizes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values.
The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. • Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. • Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. Business Combinations.
The Partnership accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.
The primary drivers that generate goodwill are the value of synergies between the acquired entities and the Partnership, and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies as an identifiable intangible asset.
Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
The Partnership expenses all acquisition-related costs as incurred. Use of Estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Estimates have been made by management in the areas of self-insurance and litigation reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs, valuation of derivative instruments, depreciation and
7
Table of Contents amortization
of long-lived assets, asset impairment assessments, tax valuation allowances, allowances for doubtful accounts, and purchase price allocation for acquired businesses.
The Partnership uses Society of Actuaries life expectancy information when developing the annual mortality assumptions for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are used to measure net periodic benefit costs and the obligation under these plans.
Actual results could differ from those estimates, making it reasonably possible that a material change in these estimates could occur in the near term. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.
In January 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-01 “Reference Rate Reform” (“Topic 848”). This update provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Topic 848 became effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020, and will continue through December 31, 2024, which will be the Partnership’s first quarter of fiscal 2025.
LIBOR rates based on US dollars will have an extended expiration date of June 30, 2023. Borrowings under the Partnership’s revolving credit facility bear interest at prevailing interest rates based partially on LIBOR (refer to Note 10, “Long-Term Borrowings” for more details). The Partnership expects to adopt Topic 848 during its second quarter of fiscal 2023 and anticipates that the adoption will not have a material impact on the Partnership’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
3. Disaggregation of Revenue The following table disaggregates revenue for each customer type.
See Note 18, “Segment Information” for more information on segment reporting wherein it is disclosed that the Partnership’s Propane, Fuel Oil and Refined Fuels and Natural Gas and Electricity reportable segments generated approximately
86 %,
8 % and
2 %, respectively, of the Partnership’s revenue from its reportable segments for all periods presented.
The propane segment contributes the majority of the Partnership’s revenue and the concentration of revenue by customer type for the propane segment is not materially different from the consolidated revenue.

4. Investments in and Acquisitions of Businesses Suburban Renewable Energy owns a
25 % equity stake in Independence Hydrogen, Inc. (“IH”) based in Ashburn, VA.
IH is a veteran-owned and operated, privately held company developing a gaseous hydrogen ecosystem to deliver locally sourced hydrogen to local markets, with a primary focus on material handling and backup power applications.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, Suburban Renewable Energy announced an agreement to construct, own and operate a new biodigester system with Adirondack Farms, a family dairy farm located in Clinton County, New York, for the production of renewable natural gas (“RNG”).
Construction of the assets began during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and is expected to be completed within 18-24 months. The Operating Partnership owns a
38 %
equity stake in Oberon Fuels, Inc. (“Oberon”) based in San Diego, California and has also purchased certain secured convertible notes issued by Oberon.
Oberon, a development-stage producer of low-carbon, renewable dimethyl ether (“rDME”) transportation fuel, is focused on the research and development of practical and affordable pathways to zero-emission transportation through its proprietary production process. Oberon's rDME fuel is a low-carbon, zero-soot alternative to petroleum diesel, and when blended with propane can significantly reduce its carbon intensity.
Additionally, rDME is a carrier for
8
Table of Contents hydrogen,
making it easy to deliver this renewable fuel for the growing hydrogen fuel cell vehicle industry.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Operating Partnership purchased an additional secured convertible note issued by Oberon.
These investments and partnerships were made in line with the Partnership’s
Go Green with Suburban Propane
corporate pillar, which focuses on advocating for the clean-burning and versatile nature of propane and renewable propane as a solution to a lower carbon future and investing in innovative, renewable energy alternatives to lower GHG emissions.
The investments in IH and Oberon are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting and were included in “Other assets” within the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and the Partnership’s equity in their earnings were included in “Other, net” within the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
5. Financial Instruments and Risk Management Cash and Cash Equivalents.
The Partnership considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of
three months
or less to be cash equivalents.
The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Commodity Price Risk .
Given the retail nature of its operations, the Partnership maintains a certain level of priced physical inventory to help ensure its field operations have adequate supply commensurate with the time of year.
The Partnership’s strategy is to keep its physical inventory priced relatively close to market for its field operations.
The Partnership enters into a combination of exchange-traded futures and option contracts and, in certain instances, over-the-counter options and swap contracts (collectively, “derivative instruments”) to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventories, as well as future purchases of propane or fuel oil used in its operations, and to help ensure adequate supply during periods of high demand.
In addition, the Partnership sells propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices, and enters into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts.
Under this risk management strategy, realized gains or losses on derivative instruments will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold or delivered as it pertains to fixed price contracts.
All of the Partnership’s derivative instruments are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
In addition, in the course of normal operations, the Partnership routinely enters into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase or sale of propane and fuel oil that qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts.
Such contracts are exempted from the fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract.
The Partnership does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
Market risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored daily for compliance with the Partnership’s Hedging and Risk Management Policy which includes volume limits for open positions.
Priced on-hand inventory is also reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices. On the date that derivative instruments are entered into, other than those designated as normal purchases or normal sales, the Partnership makes a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or other comprehensive income (“OCI”), depending on whether the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the Partnership formally assesses, both at the hedge contract’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in OCI to the extent effective and reclassified into earnings during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings.
The mark-to-market gains or losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges, and that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sale exemption, are recorded within earnings as they occur.
Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are reported as operating activities within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest Rate Risk .
A portion of the Partnership’s borrowings bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon, at the Operating Partnership’s option, LIBOR plus an applicable margin or the base rate, defined as the higher of the
Federal Funds Rate
plus
½
of 1% or the agent bank’s prime rate, or
LIBOR
plus
1 %, plus the applicable margin.
The applicable margin is dependent on the level of the Partnership’s total leverage (the ratio of total debt to income before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)).
Therefore, the Partnership is subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate.
From time to time, the Partnership manages part of its variable interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements.
The Partnership did not enter into any interest rate swap agreements during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 or in fiscal 2022.   9
Table of Contents Valuation of Derivative Instruments .
The Partnership measures the fair value of its exchange-traded options and futures contracts using quoted market prices found on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the “NYMEX”) (Level 1 inputs); the fair value of its swap contracts using quoted forward prices, and the fair value of its interest rate swaps using model-derived valuations driven by observable projected movements of the 3-month LIBOR (Level 2 inputs); and the fair value of its over-the-counter options contracts using Level 3 inputs.
The Partnership’s over-the-counter options contracts are valued based on an internal option model.
The inputs utilized in the model are based on publicly available information as well as broker quotes.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of the Partnership’s over-the-counter options contracts are interest rate and market volatility. The following summarizes the fair value of the Partnership’s derivative instruments and their location in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of

7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at a reporting unit level, on an annual basis as of the end of fiscal July of each year, or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment. The Partnership has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing an impairment test is unnecessary.
However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform an impairment test. Under
an impairment test, the Partnership assesses the carrying value of goodwill at a reporting unit level based on an estimate of the fair value of the respective reporting unit.
Fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses taking into
11
Table of Contents consideration
estimated cash flows in a
ten-year
projection period and a terminal value calculation at the end of the projection period.
If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill associated with the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired.
If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The carrying values of goodwill assigned to the Partnership’s operating segments are as follows:

8. Leases
The Partnership leases certain property, plant and equipment, including portions of its vehicle fleet, for various periods under noncancelable leases all of which were determined to be operating leases.
The Partnership determines if an agreement contains a lease at inception based on the Partnership’s right to the economic benefits of the leased assets and its right to direct the use of the leased asset.
Right-of-use assets represent the Partnership’s right to use an underlying asset, and right-of-use liabilities represent the Partnership’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term.
As most of the Partnership’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Partnership uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date, adjusted for the lease term, to determine the present value of the lease payments.
This rate is calculated based on a collateralized rate for the specific leasing activities of the Partnership. Some leases include one or more options to renew at the Partnership’s discretion, with renewal terms that can extend the lease from
one
to
fifteen
additional years.
The renewal options are included in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities if the Partnership is reasonably certain to exercise the renewal options.
Short-term leases are leases having an initial term of
twelve months
or less.
The Partnership recognizes expenses for short-term leases on a straight-line basis and does not record a lease asset or lease liability for such leases. The Partnership has residual value guarantees associated with certain of its operating leases, related primarily to transportation equipment. See Note 14, “Guarantees” for more information.

9. Net Income Per Common Unit Computations of basic income per Common Unit are performed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of outstanding Common Units, and vested (and unissued) restricted units granted under the Partnership’s Restricted Unit Plans, as defined below, to retirement-eligible grantees.
Computations of diluted income per Common Unit are performed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of outstanding Common Units and unissued restricted units granted under the Restricted Unit Plans.
In computing diluted net income per Common Unit, weighted average units outstanding used to compute basic net income per Common Unit were increased by
298,953
and
277,223
units for the
three months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively, to reflect the potential dilutive effect of the unvested restricted units outstanding using the treasury stock method.

Senior Notes 2027 Senior Notes.
On
February 14, 2017 , the Partnership and its
100 %-owned subsidiary, Suburban Energy Finance Corp., completed a public offering of $ 350,000
in aggregate principal amount of
5.875 % senior notes due
March 1, 2027
(the “2027 Senior Notes”).
The 2027 Senior Notes were issued at
100 %
of the principal amount and require semi-annual interest payments in March and September.
13
Table of Contents The
net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes, along with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, were used to repurchase, satisfy and discharge all of the Partnership’s then-outstanding
7.375 % senior notes due in 2021.
2031 Senior Notes .
On
May 24, 2021 , the Partnership and its 100%-owned subsidiary, Suburban Energy Finance Corp., completed a private offering of $ 650,000
in aggregate principal amount of
5.0 % senior notes due
June 1, 2031
(the “2031 Senior Notes”) to “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The 2031 Senior Notes were issued at
100 % of the principal amount and require semi-annual interest payments in June and December.
The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes, along with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, were used to repurchase, satisfy and discharge all of the Partnership’s then-outstanding
5.5 % senior notes due in 2024 and
5.75 % senior notes due in 2025. The Partnership’s obligations under the 2027 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness and equally in right of payment with any future senior indebtedness.
The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to, which means they rank effectively behind, any debt and other liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
The Partnership is permitted to redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at redemption prices and times as specified in the indentures governing the Senior Notes.
The Senior Notes each have a change of control provision that would require the Partnership to offer to repurchase the notes at
101 % of the principal amount repurchased, if a change of control, as defined in the indentures governing the terms of the Senior Notes, occurs and is followed by a rating decline (a decrease in the rating of the notes by either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard and Poor’s Rating Group by one or more gradations) within
90
days of the consummation of the change of control. Credit Agreement.
The Operating Partnership has an amended and restated credit agreement dated March 5, 2020 (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $ 500,000
revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), of which $ 123,500
and $ 89,600
was outstanding as of December 24, 2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively.
The Revolving Credit Facility matures on
March 5, 2025 .
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
The Operating Partnership has the right to prepay any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, in whole or in part, without penalty at any time prior to maturity. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries and the Partnership, as well as certain financial covenants, including (a) requiring the Partnership’s Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to be not less than
2.5
to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, (b) prohibiting the Total Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of the Partnership from being greater than
5.75
to 1.0, and (c) prohibiting the Senior Secured Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of the Operating Partnership from being greater than
3.25
to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter.
The Partnership and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership act as guarantors with respect to the obligations of the Operating Partnership under the Credit Agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth therein.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of the personal property of the Partnership, the Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries, as well as mortgages on certain real property. As of December 24, 2022, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon, at the Operating Partnership’s option, LIBOR plus the Applicable Rate, or the base rate, defined as the higher of the
Federal Funds Rate
plus
½ of 1% , the administrative agent bank’s prime rate, or
LIBOR
plus
1 %, plus in each case the Applicable Rate.
The Applicable Rate is dependent upon the Partnership’s Total Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
As of
December 24, 2022 , the interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately
6.50 %.
The interest rate and the Applicable Rate will be reset following the end of each calendar quarter.
On December 28, 2022, the Operating Partnership amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, replace the LIBOR component of the borrowing rate with a term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).
See Note 19, “Subsequent Events” for more information. As of December 24, 2022, the Partnership had standby letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility of $ 50,862
which expire periodically through
November 21, 2023 . The Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes both contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries and the Partnership, respectively, including (i) restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and (ii) restrictions on certain liens, investments, guarantees, loans, advances, payments, mergers, consolidations, distributions, sales of assets and other transactions.
Under the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Senior Notes, the Operating Partnership and the Partnership are generally permitted to make cash distributions equal to available cash, as defined, as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter, if no event of default exists or would exist upon making such distributions, and with respect to the indentures governing the Senior Notes, the Partnership’s Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined, is greater than
1.75
to
1.
The

Table of Contents Partnership
and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with all covenants and terms of the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement as of December 24, 2022. The aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturities subsequent to December 24, 2022
are as follows: fiscal 2023: $- 0 -; fiscal 2024: $- 0 -; fiscal 2025: $ 123,500 ; fiscal 2026: $- 0 -; fiscal 2027: $ 350,000 ; and thereafter: $ 650,000 .
11. Distributions of Available Cash The Partnership makes distributions to its partners no later than
45
days after the end of each fiscal quarter in an aggregate amount equal to its Available Cash for such quarter.
Available Cash, as defined in the Partnership Agreement, generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements.
These reserves are retained for the proper conduct of the Partnership’s business, the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters. On
January 19, 2023 , the Partnership announced a quarterly distribution
of $ 0.325

12. Unit-Based Compensation Arrangements The Partnership recognizes compensation cost over the respective service period for employee services received in exchange for an award of equity, or equity-based compensation, based on the grant date fair value of the award.
The Partnership measures liability awards under an equity-based payment arrangement based on remeasurement of the award’s fair value at the conclusion of each interim and annual reporting period until the date of settlement, taking into consideration the probability that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Restricted Unit Plan.
At the Partnership’s Tri-Annual Meeting held on May 15, 2018, the Unitholders approved and the Partnership adopted the Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. 2018 Restricted Unit Plan (the “Restricted Unit Plan”) authorizing the issuance of up to
1,800,000
Common Units to executives, managers and other employees and members of the Board of Supervisors of the Partnership.
The Restricted Unit Plan was amended and restated to authorize the issuance of an additional
1,725,000
Common Units for a total of
3,525,000
Common Units by approval of the Unitholders at the Partnership’s Tri-Annual Meeting held on May 18, 2021.
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee of the Partnership’s Board of Supervisors (the “Compensation Committee”) on or before the grant date,
33.33 % of all outstanding awards under the Restricted Unit Plan will vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the award grant date.
Participants in the Restricted Unit Plan are not eligible to receive quarterly distributions on, or vote, their respective restricted units until vested.
Restricted units cannot be sold or transferred prior to vesting. The value of each restricted unit is established by the market price of the Common Unit on the date of grant, net of estimated future distributions during the vesting period.
Restricted units are subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances as defined in the Restricted Unit Plan. Compensation expense for the unvested awards is recognized ratably over the vesting periods and is net of estimated forfeitures. During the three months ended December 24, 2022 , the Partnership awarded
506,061
restricted units under the Restricted Unit Plan at an aggregate grant date fair value of $ 6,859 .

Table of Contents   (1) During fiscal 2023, the Partnership withheld
171,840
Common Units from participants for income tax withholding purposes for those executive officers of the Partnership whose shares of restricted units vested during the period. As of December 24, 2022 , unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted units awarded under the Restricted Unit Plan amounted to $ 8,138 .
Compensation cost associated with unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.1
years.
Compensation expense for the Restricted Unit Plan, net of forfeitures, for the three months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was $ 2,471
and $ 2,709 , respectively. Phantom Equity Plan.
At its November 8, 2022 meeting, the Compensation Committee adopted the Phantom Equity Plan (the “PEP”) to incentivize behaviors that will lead to the creation of long-term value for the Partnership’s Unitholders by functioning as a cash-settled corollary plan to the Partnership’s Restricted Unit Plan.
The executive officers of the Partnership, the members of the Board, and other employees of the Partnership are eligible for awards of phantom units under the PEP.
Unless otherwise stipulated by the Compensation Committee, the standard vesting schedule for awards under the PEP will be one third of each award on each of the first three anniversaries of the award grant date, subject to continuous employment or service from the grant date through the applicable payment date.
Unvested awards are subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances, as defined in the PEP document and the applicable award agreements.
Upon vesting, phantom units are automatically converted into cash equal to the average of the highest and lowest trading prices of the Partnership’s Common Units on the vesting date. Compensation expense, which includes adjustments to previously recognized compensation expense for current period changes in the fair value of unvested awards, for the three months ended December 24, 2022 was $ 652 .
As of December 24, 2022, the Partnership had a liability included within accrued employment and benefit costs (or other liabilities, as applicable) of $ 652 . Distribution Equivalent Rights Plan.
On January 17, 2017, the Partnership adopted the Distribution Equivalent Rights Plan (the “DER Plan”), as amended on November 8, 2022, which gives the Compensation Committee discretion to award distribution equivalent rights (“DERs”) to executive officers of the Partnership.
Once awarded, DERs entitle the grantee to a cash payment each time the Board of Supervisors declares a cash distribution on the Partnership’s Common Units, which cash payment will be equal to an amount calculated by multiplying the number of unvested restricted units and unvested phantom units which are held by the grantee on the record date of the distribution, by the amount of the declared distribution per Common Unit.
Compensation expense recognized under the DER Plan for the three months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was $ 335
and $ 299 , respectively. Long-Term Incentive Plan.
On August 6, 2013, the Partnership adopted the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2014 LTIP”) and on November 10, 2020, the Partnership adopted the 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2021 LTIP” and together with the 2014 LTIP, “the LTIPs”).
The LTIPs are non-qualified, unfunded, long-term incentive plans for executive officers and key employees that provide for payment, in the form of cash, of an award of equity-based compensation at the end of a three-year performance period .
The 2014 LTIP document governs the terms and conditions of the fiscal 2020 award and the 2021 LTIP document governs the terms and conditions of the outstanding fiscal 2021 award and any awards granted in fiscal years thereafter.
The level of compensation earned under the 2014 LTIP was based on the Partnership’s average distribution coverage ratio over the three-year measurement period.
The Partnership’s average distribution coverage ratio was calculated as the Partnership’s average distributable cash flow, as defined by the 2014 LTIP document, for the
three years
in the measurement period, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the 2014 LTIP document, divided by the amount of annualized cash distributions to be paid by the Partnership.
The level of compensation earned under the fiscal 2021 award is evaluated using two separate measurement components: (i) 75% weight based on the level of average distributable cash flow of the Partnership over the three-year measurement period; and (ii) 25% weight based on the achievement of certain operating and strategic objectives, set by the Compensation Committee, over that award’s three-year measurement period.
The level of compensation earned under the fiscal 2022 award, and measurement periods thereafter, is also evaluated using two separate measurement components: (i) 50% weight based on the level of average distributable cash flow of the Partnership over the three-year measurement period; and (ii) 50% weight based on the achievement of certain operating and strategic objectives, set by the Compensation Committee for that award’s three-year measurement period. As a result of the quarterly remeasurement of the liability for awards under the LTIPs, compensation expense recognized for the three months ended December 24, 2022
and December 25, 2021 was $ 1,896
and $ 2,067 , respectively.
As of
December 24, 2022 , and September 24, 2022, the Partnership had a liability included within accrued employment and benefit costs (or other liabilities, as applicable) of $ 10,078
and $ 11,311 , respectively, related to estimated future payments under the LTIPs.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, cash payouts totaling $ 3,129
and $ 3,985
were made relating to the fiscal 2020 and 2019 awards, respectively.

13. Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Insurance.
The Partnership is self-insured for general and product, workers’ compensation and automobile liabilities up to predetermined amounts above which third party insurance applies.
As of December 24, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Partnership had accrued liabilities of $ 64,375
and $ 64,065 , respectively, representing the total estimated losses for known and anticipated or unasserted general and product, workers’ compensation and automobile claims.
For the portion of the estimated liability that exceeds insurance deductibles, the Partnership records an asset within other assets (or prepaid expenses and other current assets, as applicable) related to the amount of the liability expected to be covered by insurance which amounted to $ 15,710
as of December 24, 2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Legal Matters.
The Partnership’s operations are subject to operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing and delivering combustible liquids such as propane.
The Partnership has been, and will continue to be, a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation as a result of these operating hazards and risks, and as a result of other aspects of its business.
In this regard, the Partnership’s natural gas and electricity business was sued in a putative class action suit in the Northern District of New York.
The complaint alleged a number of claims under various consumer statutes and common law in New York and Pennsylvania regarding pricing offered to electricity customers in those states.
The case was dismissed in part by the district court, but causes of action based on the New York consumer statute and breach of contract were allowed to proceed.
On April 12, 2022, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the Partnership on the remaining counts and the complaint was dismissed in full.
The plaintiff has filed an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Partnership believes that the appeal is without merit.
Accordingly, it was determined that no reserve for a loss contingency is required.
Although any litigation is inherently uncertain, based on past experience, the information currently available to the Partnership, and the amount of its accrued insurance liabilities, the Partnership does not believe that currently pending or threatened litigation matters, or known claims or known contingent claims, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.
14. Guarantees The Partnership has residual value guarantees associated with certain of its operating leases, related primarily to transportation equipment, with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal
2032 .
Upon completion of the lease period, the Partnership guarantees that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount, or the Partnership will pay the lessor the difference.
Although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts, the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments the Partnership could be required to make under these leasing arrangements, assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term, was $ 34,565
as of December 24, 2022.
The fair value of residual value guarantees for outstanding operating leases was de minimis as of December 24, 2022
and September 24, 2022.

The Partnership expects to voluntarily contribute approximately $ 4,000
to the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal 2023, of which $ 1,000
was contributed during the three months ended December 24, 2022.
The projected annual contribution requirements related to the Partnership’s postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan for fiscal 2023 is $ 627 , of which $ 125
was contributed during
17
Table of Contents the three months ended December 24, 2022.
The components of net periodic benefit cost are included in the line item “Other, net” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Partnership contributes to multi-employer pension plans (“MEPPs”) in accordance with various collective bargaining agreements covering union employees.
As one of the many participating employers in these MEPPs, the Partnership is responsible with the other participating employers for any plan underfunding.
As of December 24, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Partnership’s estimated obligation to these MEPPs was $ 22,224
and $ 22,496 , respectively, as a result of its voluntary full withdrawal from certain MEPPs.

17. Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, as well as for state income tax purposes in the majority of the states in which the Partnership operates, the earnings attributable to the Partnership and the Operating Partnership are not subject to income tax at the partnership level.
With the exception of those states that impose an entity-level income tax on partnerships, the taxable income or loss attributable to the Partnership and to the Operating Partnership, which may vary substantially from the income (loss) before income taxes reported by the Partnership in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, are includable in the federal and state income tax returns of the Common Unitholders.
The aggregate difference in the basis of the Partnership’s net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined as the Partnership does not have access to each Common Unitholder’s basis in the Partnership. As described in Note 1, “Partnership Organization and Formation,” the earnings of the Corporate Entities are subject to U.S. corporate level income tax.
However, based upon past performance, the Corporate Entities are currently reporting an income tax provision composed primarily of minimum state income taxes.
A full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets (with the exception of certain net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) that arose after 2017) based upon an analysis of all available evidence, both negative and positive at the balance sheet date, which, taken as a whole, indicates that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will not be available to utilize the assets.
Management’s periodic reviews include, among other things, the nature and amount of the taxable income and expense items, the expected timing of when assets will be used or liabilities will be required to be reported and the reliability of historical profitability of businesses that are expected to provide future earnings.
Furthermore, management considered tax-planning strategies it could use to increase the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, NOLs generated by the Corporate Entities beginning in 2018 may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Corporate Entities generated a taxable loss during the 2022 and 2021 tax years, which resulted in a $ 295
and
$ 638
deferred tax benefit recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.
18. Segment Information The Partnership manages and evaluates its operations in
four
operating segments,
three
of which are reportable segments: Propane, Fuel Oil and Refined Fuels, and Natural Gas and Electricity. The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the operating segments using a number of performance measures, including gross margins and income before interest expense and provision for income taxes (operating profit). Costs excluded from these profit measures are captured in Corporate and include corporate overhead expenses not allocated to the operating segments.
Unallocated corporate overhead expenses include all costs of back office support functions that are reported as general and administrative expenses within the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In addition, certain costs associated with field operations support that are reported in operating expenses within the condensed consolidated statements of operations, including purchasing, training and safety, are not allocated to the individual operating segments.
Thus, operating profit for each operating segment includes only the costs that are directly attributable to the operations of the individual segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are otherwise the same as those described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. The propane segment is primarily engaged in the retail distribution of propane to residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and government customers and, to a lesser extent, wholesale distribution to large industrial end users.
In the residential, commercial and government markets, propane is used primarily for space heating, water heating, cooking and clothes drying.
Industrial customers use propane generally as a motor fuel burned in internal combustion engines that power over-the-road vehicles, forklifts and stationary engines, to fire furnaces and as a cutting gas.
In the agricultural markets, propane is primarily used for tobacco curing, crop drying, poultry brooding and weed control.
In addition, the Partnership’s equity investment in Oberon is included within the propane segment. The fuel oil and refined fuels segment is primarily engaged in the retail distribution of fuel oil, diesel, kerosene and gasoline to residential and commercial customers for use primarily as a source of heat in homes and buildings. The natural gas and electricity segment is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers in the deregulated energy markets of New York and Pennsylvania.
Under this operating segment, the Partnership owns the relationship with the end consumer and has agreements with the local distribution companies to deliver the natural gas or electricity from the Partnership’s suppliers to the customer. Activities in the “all other” category include the Partnership’s service business, which is primarily engaged in the sale, installation and servicing of a wide variety of home comfort equipment, particularly in the areas of heating and ventilation.
In addition, the Partnership’s equity investment in IH, as well as its biodigester systems for the production of RNG, are included within “all other”.   19

Subsequent Events Acquisition of RNG Production Assets and Formation of Joint Venture.
On December 28, 2022, the Partnership announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Suburban Renewable Energy, acquired a platform of RNG production assets from Equilibrium Capital Group (“Equilibrium”), a leading sustainability-driven asset management firm.
In addition, the parties formed a partnership to serve as a long-term growth platform for the identification, development and operation of additional RNG projects, including an existing pipeline of identified RNG projects that are in various stages of development. The purchase price of $ 190,000
for the
two
operating facilities, along with transaction fees and expenses, was funded with borrowings of approximately $ 112,000
under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the assumption of approximately $ 80,000
of
outstanding green bonds, as well as potential contingent consideration primarily based upon the future economic performance of the acquired RNG
20
Table of Contents facilities.
The RNG platform will include the following: (1) a large-scale RNG production facility in Stanfield, Arizona that is currently operating and includes
seven
anaerobic digesters, manure rights from approximately
55,000
dairy cattle and an interconnect with an interstate pipeline; (2) an operating facility in Columbus, Ohio that is currently receiving tipping fees from several large food and beverage providers for processing food waste into fertilizer and biogas, and has an active development project to upgrade the biogas into RNG for use in the transportation sector; (3) rights of first offer for a third RNG facility in the Midwest that is currently being developed by Equilibrium; and (4) the creation of a joint venture to invest in and develop approximately $ 155,000
of future RNG projects, of which Suburban Renewable Energy will own approximately
70 % and Equilibrium will own approximately
30 % once such projects are fully funded. Amendment to the Credit Agreement.
On December 28, 2022, the Operating Partnership amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, modify certain restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, and replaced the LIBOR component of the borrowing rate based on SOFR, provide for additional investment capacity to allow for future investments by Suburban Renewable Energy and to permit the assumption of debt in connection with the acquisition of the RNG platform from Equilibrium.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership as of and for the three months ended December 24, 2022, seen from our perspective.
The discussion should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.
Executive Overview
The following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition.
Our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 and in this Quarterly Report.
Management currently considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be most important to understanding our financial condition and operating performance:
Product Costs and Supply
The level of profitability in the retail propane, fuel oil, natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and our costs to acquire and transport products.
The unit cost of our products, particularly propane, fuel oil and natural gas, is subject to volatility as a result of supply and demand dynamics or other market conditions, including, but not limited to, economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing.
We enter into product supply contracts that are generally one-year agreements subject to annual renewal, and also purchase product on the open market.
We attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short-term basis.
Our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Conway, Kansas (plus transportation costs) at the time of delivery.
To supplement our annual purchase requirements, we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers, which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply.
The percentage of contract purchases, and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices, will vary from year to year based on market conditions.
Changes in our costs to acquire and transport products can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability.
There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product acquisition and transportation cost increases fully or immediately, particularly when such costs increase rapidly.
Therefore, average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as our costs fluctuate with the propane, fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas commodity markets and infrastructure conditions.
In addition, periods of sustained higher commodity and/or transportation prices can lead to customer conservation, resulting in reduced demand for our product.
According to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. propane inventory levels at the end of December 2022 were 80.7 million barrels, which was 22.7% higher than December 2021 levels and 7% higher than the five-year average for December.
These higher inventory levels led to declines in average posted propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) of 35.9% compared to the prior year first quarter.
Seasonality
The retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses, as well as the retail natural gas marketing business, are seasonal because these fuels are primarily used for heating in residential and commercial buildings.
Historically, approximately two‑thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six-month peak heating season from October through March. The fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three-fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between October and March.
Consequently, sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters.
Cash flows from operations, therefore, are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season.
We expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from April through September (our third and fourth fiscal quarters).
To the extent necessary, we will reserve cash from the second and first quarters for distribution to holders of our Common Units in the fourth quarter and the following fiscal year first quarter.
22
Table of Contents
Weather
Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products, in particular propane, fuel oil and natural gas, for both heating and agricultural purposes.
Many of our customers rely heavily on propane, fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source.
Accordingly, the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas, which can vary substantially from year to year.
In any given area, sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane, fuel oil and natural gas consumption, while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption.
Hedging and Risk Management Activities
We engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply.
We enter into propane forward, options and swap agreements with third parties, and use futures and options contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) to purchase and sell propane, fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas at fixed prices in the future.
The majority of the futures, forward and options agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory, as well as, in certain instances, forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil.
In addition, we sell propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices, and enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts. Forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract whereas futures, options and swap contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract through a net settlement mechanism.
Although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. Risk management activities are monitored by an internal Commodity Risk Management Committee, made up of six members of management and reporting to our Audit Committee, through enforcement of our Hedging and Risk Management Policy.
Inflation and Other Cost Increases
We are experiencing increased inflation in the costs of various goods and services we use to operate our business, including volatile wholesale costs for the products we distribute.
Although we have not experienced significant disruptions with securing the products we sell, inflationary factors and competition for resources across the supply chain has resulted in increased costs in a wide variety of areas, including labor, transportation costs and the cost of tanks and other equipment.
These and other factors may continue to impact our product costs, expenses, and capital expenditures, and could continue to have an impact on consumer demand as consumers manage the impact of inflation on their resources.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” included within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.
Certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results. Estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, employee benefit plans, self-insurance and litigation reserves, environmental reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us.
Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Supervisors.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 improved to $45.4 million, or $0.71 per Common Unit, compared to a net income of $21.3 million, or $0.34 per Common Unit, in the fiscal 2022 first quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA, as defined and reconciled below) increased $3.5 million, or 4.1%, to $90.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $86.5 million in the prior year first quarter.

Table of Contents
Retail propane gallons sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 of 108.8 million gallons increased 3.3% compared to the prior year, primarily due to cooler weather and favorable customer base trends. Average temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) across all of our service territories during the first quarter were 3% warmer than normal and 13% cooler than the prior year first quarter, with the majority of the heating degree days coming in the latter half of December 2022.
Average propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 35.9% compared to the prior year first quarter.
Total gross margin of $214.8 million in the fiscal 2023 first quarter increased $35.7 million, or 20.0%, compared to the prior year first quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 included a $13.7 million unrealized loss attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment for derivative instruments used in risk management activities, compared to a $33.5 million unrealized loss in the prior year first quarter.
These non-cash adjustments, which were reported in cost of products sold, were excluded from Adjusted EBITDA for both periods. Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market adjustments, total gross margin increased $15.9 million, or 7.5%, compared to the prior year first quarter, primarily due to higher volumes sold and higher unit margins.
Excluding the impact of the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, propane unit margins for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $0.06, or 3.2%, per gallon compared to the prior year.
Combined operating and general and administrative expenses of $138.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 10.5% compared to the prior year first quarter, primarily due to higher payroll and benefit-related expenses, higher vehicle lease and fuel costs, as well as other inflationary effects on our operating costs. Included in general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were fees and expenses of $0.9 million associated with the acquisition of the renewable natural gas (“RNG”) production facilities from Equilibrium Capital Group (“Equilibrium”) which closed at the beginning of our fiscal 2023 second quarter.
These acquisition-related costs were excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.
Total debt outstanding as of December 2022 was $52.9 million lower than at the end of the prior year first quarter, and our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, for the twelve-month period ending December 24, 2022 was 3.68x.
As previously announced on January 19, 2023, the Partnership’s Board of Supervisors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.325 per Common Unit effective for the distribution payable in respect of the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
This distribution is payable on February 7, 2023 to Common Unitholders of record as of January 31, 2023.
Our anticipated cash requirements for the remainder of fiscal 2023 include: (i) acquisition of a platform of RNG assets from Equilibrium for $190.0 million that was funded at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with borrowings of approximately $112.0 million under our revolving credit facility and the assumption of approximately $80.0 million of outstanding green bonds; (ii) maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately $14.3 million and $42.6 million, respectively; (iii) interest and income tax payments of approximately $55.1 million; and (iv) cash distributions of approximately $61.9 million to our Common Unitholders based on the quarterly distribution rate of $0.325 per Common Unit.
Based on our liquidity position, which includes cash on hand, availability of funds under our revolving credit facility and expected cash flow from operating activities, we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations.
Recent Developments
As referenced above and in Item 1, Note 19 of this Quarterly Report, we made meaningful progress in the expansion of our renewable energy platform subsequent to the first quarter of 2023.
On December 28, 2022, we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, Suburban Renewable Energy, LLC (“Suburban Renewable Energy”), acquired a platform of two operating RNG production assets from Equilibrium, a leading sustainability-driven asset management firm.
In addition, the parties formed a partnership to serve as a long-term growth platform for the identification, development and operation of additional RNG projects, including an existing pipeline of identified RNG projects that are in various stages of development.
The RNG platform will include the following: (1) a large-scale RNG facility in Stanfield, Arizona, one of the largest agricultural waste RNG production facilities currently operating in the United States, which includes seven anaerobic digesters, manure rights from approximately 55,000 dairy cattle and an interconnect with an interstate pipeline; (2) an operating facility in Columbus, Ohio that is currently receiving tipping fees from several large food and beverage providers for processing food waste into fertilizer and biogas, and has an active development project to upgrade the biogas into RNG for use in the transportation sector; (3) rights of first offer for a third RNG facility in the Midwest that is currently being developed by Equilibrium; and (4) the creation of a joint venture, called Suburban EQ RNG, LLC, to invest in and develop approximately $155.0 million of future RNG projects, of which Suburban Renewable Energy will own approximately 70% and Equilibrium will own approximately 30% once such projects are fully funded.
The RNG platform acquired is diversified across feedstocks, geographies and revenue streams, and complements Suburban Renewable Energy’s ongoing activity to construct, own and operate an RNG facility at Adirondack Farms in Clinton County, New York.
While the acquisition will immediately enhance and increase Suburban Renewable Energy’s presence in RNG production and distribution, the partnership with Equilibrium through the joint venture arrangement will provide visible growth and experienced management in the rapidly developing waste-to-energy economy.
RNG can be produced from multiple organic waste streams, including agricultural and food waste, helping to reduce methane emissions, while offering a lower

carbon solution as a drop-in replacement for traditional natural gas.
The scalable platform complements our existing portfolio of renewable energy assets, either as a stand-alone RNG distributor, or as a pathway to hydrogen or rDME production.
Suburban Propane has a proud 95-year legacy of being a trusted provider of energy to local communities.
Leveraging the strength and stability of our core propane business, we are investing in the clean energy economy of the future as society transitions to lower carbon alternatives, and positioning us for long-term growth.

As discussed above, average temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) across all of our service territories during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were 3% warmer than normal and 13% cooler than the prior year first quarter.
While there was an overall increase in heating degree days compared to the prior year, seven of the nine weeks in the November and December period were negatively impacted by milder temperatures, particularly in our East and Midwest operating territories.
Revenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of $342.4 million increased $11.2 million, or 3.4%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher volumes sold, which were nominally offset by lower average retail selling prices compared to the prior year.
Retail propane gallons sold increased 3.5 million gallons, or 3.3%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to cooler weather, resulting in a $10.9 million increase in revenues.
Included within the propane segment are revenues from other propane activities, which increased $0.3 million primarily due to a higher notional amount of hedging contracts used in risk management activities that were settled physically.
Revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of $30.1 million were $9.2 million, or 43.8%, higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher average retail selling prices associated with higher wholesale costs, offset to an extent by a decrease in volumes sold. Average fuel oil and refined fuels selling prices increased 58.0% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher average wholesale costs, resulting in a $10.9 million increase in revenues.
Fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold decreased 0.6 million gallons, or 9.3%, primarily due to customer conservation, resulting in a $1.7 million decrease in revenues.
Revenues in our natural gas and electricity segment of $8.7 million were $0.5 million, or 5.8%, lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower usage resulting from a lower customer base, nominally offset by higher average selling prices.

The cost of products sold reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane, fuel oil and refined fuels, and natural gas and electricity sold, including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers.
Cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products.
Given the retail nature of our operations, we maintain a certain level of priced physical inventory to help ensure that our field operations have adequate supply commensurate with the time of year.
Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to keep our physical inventory priced relatively close to market for our field operations.
Consistent with past practices, we principally utilize futures and/or options contracts traded on the NYMEX to mitigate the price risk associated with our priced physical inventory, as well as, in certain instances, forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil.
In addition, we sell propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices, and enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts.
At expiration, the derivative contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment to the respective party of a net amount equal to the difference between the then market price and the fixed contract price or option exercise price.
Under this risk management strategy, realized gains or losses on futures or options contracts, which are reported in cost of products sold, will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold or delivered as it pertains to fixed price contracts (which may or may not occur in the same accounting period).
We do not use futures or options contracts, or other derivative instruments, for speculative trading purposes.
Unrealized non-cash gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded within cost of products sold.
Cost of products sold excludes depreciation and amortization; these amounts are reported separately within the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
In the commodities markets, average posted propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) and fuel oil prices were 35.9% lower and 49.2% higher than the prior year first quarter, respectively.
The net change in the fair value of derivative instruments resulted in a $13.7 million unrealized non-cash loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to a $33.5 million unrealized non-cash loss in the prior year first quarter, resulting in a net decrease of $19.8 million in cost of products sold year-over-year, all of which was reported within the propane segment.
These unrealized mark-to-market adjustments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA for both periods.
Cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of $149.8 million decreased $21.4 million, or 12.5%, compared to the prior year first quarter.
Lower average wholesale costs, net of realized gains on commodity hedges, contributed to a decrease in cost of products sold of $10.3 million, while higher volumes sold contributed to an increase of $5.3 million.
Included within the propane segment are costs from other propane activities, which increased $3.4 million compared to the prior year due to a higher notional amount of hedging contracts that were settled physically, as well as the net decrease in cost of products sold of $19.8 million resulting from the mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments in both periods discussed above.
Cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of $22.4 million increased $7.7 million, or 52.8%, compared to the prior year first quarter.
Higher average wholesale costs led to an increase of $9.1 million, which was offset to an extent by a $1.4 million decrease associated with lower volumes sold.
Cost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of $5.9 million decreased $0.2 million, or 4.0%, compared to the prior year primarily due to lower usage, partially offset by higher natural gas and electricity wholesale costs.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA represents net income before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the unrealized net gain or loss on mark-to-market activity for derivative instruments and other items, as applicable, as provided in the table below. Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of operating performance and we are including them because we believe that they provide our investors and industry analysts with additional information that we determined is useful to evaluate our operating results.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under US GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with US GAAP.
Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as determined by us excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income, they may not be comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table sets forth our calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

Our management uses gross margin as a supplemental measure of operating performance and we are including it as we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information that we determined is useful to evaluate our operating results.
As cost of products sold does not include depreciation and amortization expense, the gross margin we reference is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Analysis of Cash Flows
Operating Activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 of $6.3 million increased $19.6 million compared to the corresponding prior year period.
The increase was primarily due to higher earnings and lower working capital needs compared to the prior year, given the general decline in commodity prices.
Investing Activities.
Net cash used in investing activities of $14.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 consisted of capital expenditures of $10.8 million (including approximately $5.1 million to support the growth of operations and $5.7 million for maintenance expenditures), a $3.0 million investment in a privately held start-up entity (plus direct transactions costs) and an additional investment in Oberon, partially offset by approximately $0.7 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities of $10.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 consisted of capital expenditures of $10.7 million (including approximately $6.3 million to support the growth of operations and $4.4 million for maintenance expenditures), $0.9 million used to fund the acquisition of certain assets of a retail propane business and an additional investment in Oberon, partially offset by approximately $1.2 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
Financing Activities.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $10.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 reflected $33.9 million in net borrowings under our credit agreement’s revolving credit facility which were used to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and the investments noted above, offset to an extent by $20.5 million paid for the quarterly distributions to Common Unitholders at a rate of $0.325 per Common Unit paid in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and other financing activities of $3.3 million.

Summary of Long-Term Debt Obligations and Revolving Credit Facility
As of December 24, 2022, our long-term debt consisted of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due March 1, 2027, $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due June 1, 2031 and $123.5 million outstanding under our $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) provided by our credit agreement.
On December 28, 2022, we amended the credit agreement to modify certain restrictive and affirmative covenants set forth in the credit agreement and replace the LIBOR component of the borrowing rate based on SOFR.
Total long-term borrowings as of December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was $1,123.5 million and $1,176.4 million, respectively.
See Item 1, Note 10 of this Quarterly Report.
Based upon our Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 24, 2022, and outstanding borrowings and letters of credits issued under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 24, 2022, our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility was $325.6 million.
The aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturities subsequent to December 24, 2022 are as follows: fiscal 2023: $-0-; fiscal 2024: $-0-; fiscal 2025: $123.5 million; fiscal 2026: $-0-; fiscal 2027: $350.0 million; and thereafter: $650.0 million.
Partnership Distributions
We are required to make distributions in an amount equal to all of our Available Cash, as defined in our Third Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, as amended (the “Partnership Agreement”), no more than 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates.
Available Cash, as defined in the Partnership Agreement, generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements.
These reserves are retained for the proper conduct of our business, the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters.
The Board of Supervisors reviews the level of Available Cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management.
On January 19, 2023, we announced a quarterly distribution of $0.325 per Common Unit, or $1.30 on an annualized basis, in respect of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, payable on February 7, 2023 to holders of record on January 31, 2023.
Other Commitments
We have a noncontributory, cash balance format, defined benefit pension plan which was frozen to new participants effective January 1, 2000.
Effective January 1, 2003, the defined benefit pension plan was amended such that future service credits ceased and eligible employees would receive interest credits only toward their ultimate retirement benefit.
We also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees under a plan that was frozen to new participants effective March 31, 1998.
At December 24, 2022, we had a liability for the defined benefit pension plan and accrued retiree health and life benefits of $20.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively.
We are self-insured for general and product, workers’ compensation and automobile liabilities up to predetermined thresholds above which third party insurance applies.
At December 24, 2022, we had accrued insurance liabilities of $64.4 million, and a receivable of $15.7 million related to the amount of the liability expected to be covered by insurance.

ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Commodity Price Risk
We enter into product supply contracts that are generally one-year agreements subject to annual renewal, and also purchase product on the open market.
Our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Conway, Kansas (plus transportation costs) at the time of delivery. In addition, to supplement our annual purchase requirements, we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers, which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to ensure adequate physical supply.
The percentage of contract purchases, and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices, will vary from year to year based on market conditions.
In certain instances, and when market conditions are favorable, we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the market.
Product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability. We attempt to reduce commodity price risk by pricing product on a short-term basis.
The level of priced, physical product maintained in storage facilities and at our customer service centers for immediate sale to our customers will vary depending on several factors, including, but not limited to, price, supply and demand dynamics for a given time of the year.
Typically, our on hand priced position does not exceed more than four to eight weeks of our supply needs, depending on the time of the year.
In the course of normal operations, we routinely enter into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase or sale of propane and fuel oil that, under accounting rules for derivative instruments and hedging activities, qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts.
Such contracts are exempted from fair value accounting and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract.
Under our hedging and risk management strategies, we enter into a combination of exchange-traded futures and options contracts and, in certain instances, over-the-counter options and swap contracts (collectively, “derivative instruments”) to manage the price risk associated with physical product and with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations, principally propane and fuel oil, as well as to help ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand.
In addition, we sell propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices, and enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts.
We do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Futures and swap contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price for delivery at fixed future dates.
An option contract allows, but does not require, its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period.
However, the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract, should the holder choose to exercise the option.
At expiration, the contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then market price and the fixed contract price or option exercise price.
To the extent that we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risk and commodity prices move adversely in relation to the contracts, we could suffer losses on those derivative instruments when settled.
Conversely, if prices move favorably, we could realize gains.
Under our hedging and risk management strategy, realized gains or losses on derivative instruments will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold to customers at market prices, or delivered to customers as it pertains to fixed price contracts.
Futures are traded with brokers of the NYMEX and require daily cash settlements in margin accounts.
Forward contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term by physical delivery, and swap and options contracts are generally settled at expiration through a net settlement mechanism.
Market risks associated with our derivative instruments are monitored daily for compliance with our Hedging and Risk Management Policy which includes volume limits for open positions. Open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices.

Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are guaranteed by the NYMEX and, as a result, have minimal credit risk.
We are subject to credit risk with over-the-counter forward, swap and options contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform.
We evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of non-performance by our counterparties.
Interest Rate Risk
A portion of our borrowings bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon, at the Operating Partnership’s option, LIBOR, plus an applicable margin or the base rate, defined as the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus ½ of 1% or the agent bank’s prime rate, or LIBOR plus 1%, plus the applicable margin.
The applicable margin is dependent on the level of our total consolidated leverage (the total ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA).
Therefore, we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate.
From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage a part of our variable interest rate risk.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
At December 24, 2022, we were not party to an interest rate swap agreement.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
All of our derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at their fair values.
On the date that derivative instruments are entered into, we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or OCI, depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, we formally assess, both at the hedge contract’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in OCI to the extent effective and reclassified into earnings during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings.
The mark-to-market gains or losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges, and that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sale exemption, are recorded in earnings as they occur.
Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are reported as operating activities within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.
Sensitivity Analysis
In an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in commodities related to our open positions under derivative instruments, we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions:
A. The fair value of open positions as of December 24, 2022.
B. The market prices for the underlying commodities used to determine A. above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical 10% change and compared to the fair value amounts in A. above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario.
Based on the sensitivity analysis described above, the hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices for open derivative instruments as of December 24, 2022 indicates a decrease in potential future net gains of $5.1 million.
See also Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.
The above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario. Actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio.
To date, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have not materially adversely affected our product supply agreements or our hedging strategies, and we currently believe that we will continue to have access to sufficient supply to meet customer demand.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Partnership maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Partnership’s filings and submissions under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Partnership’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Partnership completed an evaluation under the supervision and with participation of the Partnership’s management, including the Partnership’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 24, 2022.
Based on this evaluation, the Partnership’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December 24, 2022, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide the reasonable assurance described above.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 24, 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting.
