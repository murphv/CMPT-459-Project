Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
Note
1.
Organization and Description of Business
Organization
Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Denver, Colorado. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries including Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping, Inc. (“Brundage-Bone”), Capital Pumping (“Capital”), Camfaud Group Limited (“Camfaud”), and Eco-Pan, Inc. (“Eco-Pan”).
Nature of business
Brundage-Bone and Capital are concrete pumping service providers in the United States ("U.S.") and Camfaud is a concrete pumping service provider in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). Their core business is the provision of concrete pumping services to general contractors and concrete finishing companies in the commercial, infrastructure and residential sectors. Most often equipment returns to a “home base” nightly and these service providers do
not
contract to purchase, mix, or deliver concrete. Brundage-Bone and Capital collectively have approximately  100
branch locations across approximately
20
states, with its corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. Camfaud has approximately  30
branch locations throughout the U.K., with its corporate headquarters in Epping (near London), England.
Eco-Pan provides industrial cleanup and containment services, primarily to customers in the construction industry. Eco-Pan uses containment pans specifically designed to hold waste products from concrete and other industrial cleanup operations. Eco-Pan has  18
operating locations across the U.S. with its corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. In addition, we have concrete waste management operations under our Eco-Pan brand name in the U.K. and currently operate from a shared Camfaud location.
Seasonality
The Company’s sales are historically seasonal, with lower revenue in the
first
quarter and higher revenue in the
fourth
quarter of each year. Such seasonality also causes the Company’s working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter and primarily depends on the variability of weather patterns with the Company generally having lower sales volume during the winter and spring months.
Note
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
We describe our significant accounting policies in Note
2
of the notes to consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the year ended
October 31, 2022.
During the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023 , there were
no
significant changes to those accounting policies.
Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared, without audit, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do
not
include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The enclosed statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company at
January 31, 2023
and for all periods presented.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Table of Contents
Revenue recognition
The Company generates revenues primarily from ( 1 ) concrete pumping services in both the U.S. and U.K and ( 2 ) the Company’s concrete waste services business, both of which are discussed below. In addition, the Company generates an immaterial amount of revenue from the sales of replacement parts to customers. The Company’s delivery terms for replacement part sales are FOB shipping point. Revenue is disaggregated between
two
accounting standards: ( 1 ) ASC
606,
Revenue Recognition
("ASC
606" ) and ( 2 ) ASC
842,
Leases
("ASC
842" ).
Leases as Lessor
Our Eco-Pan pan business involves contracts with customers whereby we are a lessor for the rental component of the contract and therefore, such rental components of the contract are recorded as lease revenue. We account for such rental contracts as operating leases. We recognize revenue from pan rentals in the period earned, regardless of the timing of billing to customers. The lease component of the revenue is disaggregated by a base price that is based on the number of contractual days and a variable component that is based on days in excess of the number of contractual days.
The table below summarizes our revenues as presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022
by revenue type and by applicable accounting standard:

Newly adopted accounting pronouncements
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")
2020 - 04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic
848 ): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU
2020 - 04” ) - In
March 2020,
the FASB issued ASU
2020 - 04,
which provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Specifically, to the extent the Company's debt agreements are modified to replace LIBOR with another interest rate index, ASU
2020 - 04
will permit the Company to account for the modification as a continuation of the existing contract without additional analysis. Companies
may
generally elect to apply the guidance for periods that include
March 12, 2020
through
December 31, 2022.
Effective
October 1, 2021,  the Company transitioned all of its GBP borrowings from LIBOR to the Sterling Overnight Index Average ("SONIA") rate. Effective
June 29, 2022,
the Company transitioned all of its U.S. Dollar borrowings from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). See Note
8
for further discussion.
ASU
2016 - 02,
Leases ("ASU
2016 - 02" ) - In
February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU
2016 - 02,
which is codified in ASC
842,
Leases (“ASC
842” ) and supersedes current lease guidance in ASC
840,
Leases. ASC
842
requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset ("ROU") and a corresponding lease liability for substantially all leases. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments while the right-of-use asset will be similarly calculated and then adjusted for initial direct costs. In addition, ASC
842
expands the disclosure requirements to increase the transparency and comparability of the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In
July 2018,
the FASB issued ASU
2018 - 11,
Leases ASC
842:
Targeted Improvements, which allows entities to initially apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.
The new standard is effective for emerging growth companies that have elected to use private company adoption dates for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2021,
and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022.
The Company adopted the guidance for the year ended
October 31, 2022,
with an effective date of adoption of
November 1, 2021.

ASU
2016 - 13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic
326 ) (“ASU
2016 - 13” ) - In
June 2016,
the FASB issued ASU
No.
2016 - 13,
which, along with subsequently issued related ASUs, requires financial assets (or groups of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, among other provisions. This ASU is effective for smaller reporting companies with fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022,
with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt the guidance during the
first
quarter of the fiscal year ending
October 31, 2024.
The amendments of this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.
Note

Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions
The Company completed
no
acquisitions during the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023
and
five
acquisitions during fiscal
2022.
All acquisitions either added complementary assets in markets in which the Company already operates or expanded the Company's footprint into adjacent markets. With the exception of the acquisition during the
fourth
quarter of fiscal
2022,
all other transactions qualified as asset acquisitions. Except for the acquisition of Pioneer in the
first
quarter of fiscal
2022
and Coastal in the
fourth
quarter of fiscal
2022,
these acquisitions were
not
individually significant to our results of operations. The consideration for the acquisitions in fiscal
2022
consisted of cash and was allocated to the acquired long-lived tangible and intangible assets.
August 2022 ( Fiscal
2022 ) Coastal Acquisition
In
August 2022,
the Company acquired the property, equipment and intangible assets of Coastal Carolina Pumping, Inc. (“Coastal”) for total purchase consideration of $ 30.8
million, which was paid for using cash and the ABL Facility (defined below). This transaction expanded our operations in the Carolinas and Florida and qualified as a business combination under ASC
805.
Accordingly, the Company recorded all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. There was
no
goodwill recognized in this transaction.
The following table represents the final allocation of consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition-date fair values with any measurement-period adjustments included:
(in thousands)
Consideration paid:
$ 30,762
Net assets acquired:
Intangible assets
$ 2,500
Property and equipment
28,500
Liabilities assumed
( 238
)
Total net assets acquired
$ 30,762
All assets were valued using level
3
inputs. The equipment was valued using a market approach while the intangible assets were valued using an income approach based on management’s projections.
Identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of customer relationships of $ 1.7
million and non-compete agreements valued at $ 0.8
million. The customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. The non-competes were valued using a direct valuation of economic damages approach. The Company determined the useful life of both the customer relationships and non-compete agreements to be
5
years.
Concurrent with closing of the asset purchase agreement, the Company signed
five
leases directly with the seller. The leases were entered into at market rates and the Company recognized an ROU asset and liability of $ 6.5
million related to these leases.

million, of which, $ 1.0
million was held back (the “Holdback”) to allow for a post-closing joint inspection of Pioneer’s fleet vehicles. The Holdback had
not
been paid out as of
January 31, 2023 . This transaction was treated as an asset acquisition. The Company allocated $ 19.1
million to the purchase of Pioneer's equipment. The remaining $ 1.1
million was allocated to a definite-lived assembled workforce intangible asset and a definite-lived customer relationships intangible asset. All assets were valued using level
3
inputs. The equipment was valued using a market approach while the intangible assets were valued using an income approach based on management’s projections. The intangible assets will be amortized over
3
to
5
years.

Fair Value Measurement
The carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and current accrued liabilities approximate their fair value as recorded due to the short-term maturity of these instruments, which approximates fair value. The Company’s outstanding obligations on its asset-backed loan ("ABL") credit facility are deemed to be at fair value as the interest rates on these debt obligations are variable and consistent with prevailing rates. The fair value of the ABL credit facility is derived from Level
2
inputs. The carrying values of the Company's finance lease obligations represent fair value. There were
no
changes since
October 31, 2022
in the Company's valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
Long-term debt instruments
The Company's long-term debt instruments are recorded at their carrying values in the consolidated balance sheet, which
may
differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the long-term debt instruments are derived from Level
2
inputs.  The fair value amount of the long-term debt instruments at
January 31, 2023
and at
October 31, 2022
is presented in the table below based on the prevailing interest rates and trading activity of the Senior Notes.

Warrants
At
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , there were
13,017,677
public warrants and
no
private warrants outstanding. Each warrant entitles its holder to purchase
one
share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50
per share. The warrants expire on
December 6, 2023,
or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company
may
call the outstanding public warrants for redemption at a price of $ 0.01
per warrant, if the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $ 18.00
per share for any
20
trading days within a
30 -trading day period ending on the
third
business day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
The Company accounts for the public warrants issued in connection with its IPO in accordance with ASC
815,
under which certain provisions in the public warrant agreements do
not
meet the criteria for equity classification and therefore these warrants must be recorded as liabilities. The fair value of each public warrant is based on the public trading price of the warrant (Level
2
fair value measurement). Gains and losses related to the warrants are reflected in the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations.
All other non-financial assets
The Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, are
not
required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value
may
not
be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles), non-financial instruments are assessed for impairment and, if applicable, written down to and recorded at fair value.

Table of Contents
Conditionally redeemable preferred shares (including preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events
not
solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. The preferred stock contains a redemption feature contingent upon a change in control, which is
not
solely within the control of the Company. As such, the preferred stock is presented outside of permanent equity.
Warrant Exchange

0.2105
shares of common stock in exchange for each outstanding public warrant tendered and
0.1538
shares of common stock in exchange for each private warrant tendered pursuant to the offer (the “Offer” or “Warrant Exchange”).
On
April 26, 2019,
a total of
9,982,123
public warrants and
11,100,000
private warrants were tendered for exchange pursuant to the Offer.  On

shares of common stock were issued in exchange for the tendered public warrants and
1,707,175
shares of common stock were issued in exchange for the tendered private warrants. A negligible amount of cash was paid for fractional shares. The fair value of common stock issued in exchange for the warrants, totaling $ 26.3
million, was recognized in additional paid in capital.
Share Repurchase Program
In
January 2023,
the board of directors of the Company approved a $ 10.0
million increase to the Company’s share repurchase program. This authorization will expire on
March 31, 2024
and is in addition to the repurchase authorization of up to $ 10.0
million through
June 15, 2023
that was previously approved in
June 2022.
The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in the open market, by block purchase, in privately negotiated transactions, in
one
or more transactions from time to time, or pursuant to any trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule
10b5 - 1
of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934
(the “Exchange Act”). Open market purchases will be conducted in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule
10b - 18
of the Exchange Act and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The repurchase program
may
be suspended, terminated, extended or otherwise modified by the Board without notice at any time for any reason, including, without limitation, market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, capital and liquidity objectives, and other factors deemed appropriate by CPH’s management.

Earnings Per Share
The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC
260,
Earnings Per Share . For purposes of calculating earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”), a company that has participating security holders (for example, holders of unvested restricted stock that have non-forfeitable dividend rights and the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock) is required to utilize the
two -class method for calculating EPS unless the treasury stock method results in lower EPS. The
two -class method is an allocation of earnings/(loss) between the holders of common stock and a company’s participating security holders. Under the
two -class method, earnings/(loss) for the reporting period is calculated by taking the net income (loss) for the period, less both the dividends declared in the period on participating securities (whether or
not
paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or
not
earned) for the period. Our common shares outstanding are comprised of shareholder owned common stock and shares of unvested restricted stock held by participating security holders. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, excluding participating shares. To calculate diluted EPS, basic EPS is further adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive stock options outstanding and Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of the beginning of the period.
At
January 31, 2023,
the Company had outstanding ( 1 )  13.0
million warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 , ( 2 )
2.0
million outstanding unvested restricted stock awards, ( 3 )
1.1
million outstanding unexercised incentive stock options, ( 4 )
0.4
million outstanding unexercised non-qualified stock options, and ( 5 )  2.5
million shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all of which could potentially be dilutive. The dilutive effects of the
2.5
million shares of preferred stock and
13.0
million warrants were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share for the
three -month periods ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022,
as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.

Three Months Ended January 31, 2023
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, our net income was $6.5 million, as compared to net income of $1.2 million in the same period a year ago. The primary drivers impacting comparability between the two periods were (1) a $2.3 million improvement in gross profit, driven by an $8.1 million increase in revenue that was partially offset by a 90 basis point decline in gross margin, (2) a $4.6 million gain from the revaluation of warrant liabilities during fiscal 2022 compared to no revaluation in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and (3) $0.7 million in higher income tax expense in fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022.

U.S. Concrete Pumping
Revenue for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment increased by 7%, or $4.1 million, from $63.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to $67.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue attributable to our acquisition of Coastal was $4.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
U.K. Operations
Revenue for our U.K. Operations segment increased by 6%, or $0.7 million, from $12.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to $12.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact from foreign currency translation, revenue was up 17.9% year-over-year. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to improved pricing across the U.K. region.
U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services
Revenue for the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment improved by 32%, or $3.3 million, from $10.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to $13.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily due to organic volume growth and pricing improvements.
Corporate
There was no change in revenue for our Corporate segment for the periods presented. Any year-over-year changes for our Corporate segment were primarily related to the intercompany leasing of real estate to certain of our U.S Concrete Pumping branches. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation through the Intersegment line item.

Table of Contents
Gross Margin
Our industry has experienced significant inflation in our input costs, particularly in diesel fuel in both the U.S. and the U.K. in the last five fiscal quarters. To help maintain profitability in the face of these challenges, we have increased pricing in line with the rise in our actual costs. However, given the speed of recent input cost increases, there has been a slight lag between the time of our selling price increases and any resulting revenue. In addition, there is a mathematical dilution effect in margin percentage as we only seek to pass on the actual cost increases to our customers. As a result of these factors, our gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 39.0% compared to 39.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
General and Administrative Expenses ("G&A")
G&A expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $27.0 million, an increase of $0.3 million from $26.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to (1) higher labor costs of approximately $1.2 million primarily due to additional headcount that joined the Company as a result of recent acquisitions and (2) higher legal and accounting expenses of $0.7 million. These increases were offset by (1) lower amortization of intangible assets expense of $0.9 million and (2) $1.0 million related to fluctuations in the GBP. G&A expenses as a percent of revenue were 28.9% for fiscal 2023 compared to 31.3% for the same period a year ago.
Excluding amortization of intangible assets of $4.8 million, depreciation expense of $0.6 million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million, G&A expenses were $20.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (21.9% of revenue), up $1.6 million from $18.9 million for first quarter of fiscal 2022 (22.2% of revenue). The increase was primarily due to the additional headcount and higher labor costs from recent acquisitions, legal and accounting costs, that was partially offset by fluctuations in the GBP, as discussed above.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $6.9 million, up $0.6 million from $6.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the ABL revolver draw in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities
During the three-month period ended January 31, 2023 the Company recognized a $4.6 million gain on the fair value remeasurement of our liability-classified warrants. There was no change in the fair value remeasurement of our liability-classified warrants during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The changes seen in the fair value remeasurement of the public warrants for all periods presented is due to changes in the Company's share price during the respective periods.
Income Tax (Benefit)
For the first fiscal quarter ended
January 31, 2023 the Company recorded income tax expense of $
0.6 million on pretax income of $
7.1 million. For the same quarter a year ago, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $
0.0 million on a pretax income of $
1.2 million. The effective tax rate for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily impacted by the respective change in fair value of warrant liabilities, all of which is not recognized for tax purposes.

As of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we have modified the method in which adjusted EBITDA is calculated by no longer including an add-back for director costs and public company expenses. The Company recast adjusted EBITDA for U.S. Concrete Pumping in the first quarter of 2022 by $0.7 million for these expenses to reflect this change. See
“ Non-GAAP Measures (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) ”  below for more information.
U.S. Concrete Pumping
Net loss for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment was $1.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, versus a net loss of $0.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment was $14.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, up 1.3% from $14.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the year-over-year increase in revenue that was partially offset by slightly higher costs due to inflation that drove a marginal decline in our gross margins as discussed previously.
U.K. Operations
Net loss for U.K. Operations segment was $0.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, versus a net loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.K. Operations segment was $3.2 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, versus $3.3 million from the same period in fiscal 2022. These results reflect a year-over-year improvement in revenue, which was offset by inflationary cost pressures on gross margins.
U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services
Net income for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $2.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, up from net income of $1.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $6.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, up 33.3% from $4.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the year-over-year organic growth in revenue as discussed above.
Corporate
There was no change in Adjusted EBITDA for our Corporate segment for the periods presented.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our capital structure is primarily a combination of (1) permanent financing, represented by stockholders’ equity; (2) zero-dividend convertible perpetual preferred stock; (3) long-term financing represented by our Senior Notes and (4) short-term financing under our ABL Facility. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and access to our revolving credit facility under our ABL Facility, which provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $160.0 million, subject to a borrowing base limitation. We use our liquidity and capital resources to: (1) finance working capital requirements; (2) service our indebtedness; (3) purchase property, plant and equipment; and (4) finance strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Pioneer, Coastal and others. As of January 31, 2023, we had $4.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $106.2 million of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility, providing total available liquidity of $110.2 million.
We may from time to time seek to retire or pay down borrowings on the outstanding balance of our ABL Facility or Senior Notes using cash on hand. Such repayments, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, potential acquisitions and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.
Material Cash Requirements
Our principal uses of cash historically have been to fund operating activities and working capital, purchases of property and equipment, strategic acquisitions, fund payments due under facility operating and finance leases, share repurchases and to meet debt service requirements.
The amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects. In response to changing economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either up or down) to match our actual performance. Our capital expenditures for the three-months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $17.1 million and $35.4 million, respectively.
To service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of borrowings under the ABL Facility and/or other debt and equity financing alternatives available to us, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and conditions in the global credit and capital markets, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and given the current state of the capital markets, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the ABL Facility will be adequate to service our debt and meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. See “Senior Notes and ABL Facility” discussion below for more information.
Future Contractual Obligations
For information regarding our future contractual obligations, see the MD&A discussion included in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report.

Cash Flows
Cash generated from operating activities typically reflects net income, as adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Generally, we believe our business requires a relatively low level of working capital investment due to low inventory requirements and timely customer payments due to daily billings for most of our services.
Cash flow provided by operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities generally reflects the cash effects of transactions and other events used in the determination of net income or loss.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the three-month period ended January 31, 2023 was $17.9 million. The Company had net income of $6.5 million, which included non-cash expense items of $11.4 million. In addition, we had cash outflows related to a decrease to our working capital of $0.1 million. Working capital changes primarily include an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.3 million and a decrease of $4.0 million to accounts payable, offset by a decrease in trade receivables of $10.4 million, an increase in accrued payroll, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1.9 million, and an increase in inventory of $1.0 million. The increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to timing of prepaid insurance, which is generally prepaid during first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The decrease in accounts payable is driven by timing. The decrease in trade receivables is due to seasonal collection of trade receivables during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, while the increase in accrued payroll, accrued expenses and other current liabilities is primarily related to an increase in accrued interest. The Company makes semi-annual interest payments in February and August each year.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the three-month period ended January 31, 2022 was $13.2 million. The Company had net income of $1.2 million, which included non-cash expense items of $16.3 million. In addition, we had cash outflows related to a decrease to our working capital of $4.3 million. Working capital changes primarily include an increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.3 million and a decrease of $3.5 million to accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in accrued payroll, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $5.0 million. The increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to timing of prepaid insurance, which is generally prepaid during first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The decrease to accounts payable is driven by timing. The increase in accrued payroll, accrued expenses and other current liabilities is primarily related to an increase in accrued interest. The Company makes semi-annual interest payments in February and August each year.
Cash flow used in investing activities.
Net cash used in operating activities generally reflects the cash outflows for property, plant and equipment.
We used $14.8 million to fund investing activities during the three-months ended January 31, 2023. The Company used $17.1 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, which was partially offset by $2.3 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
We used $34.5 million to fund investing activities during the three-month period ended January 31, 2022. The Company used $35.4 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and $1.1 million for the purchase of intangible assets, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $2.0 million.
Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities .
Net cash used in financing activities was $6.7 million for the three-months ended January 31, 2023. Financing activities during this period included $5.5 million in purchase of treasury stock, which included $4.9 million purchased under the share repurchase program and $0.6 million in outflows from the purchase of shares into treasury stock in order to fund the employee tax obligations for certain vested stock awards. In addition, cash used in financing activities included $1.2 million in net proceeds under the Company's ABL Facility.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $14.7 million for the three-month period ended January 31, 2022. Financing activities during this period primarily included $15.2 million in net borrowings under the Company’s ABL Facility that were partially offset by $0.5 million in outflows from the purchase of shares into treasury stock in order to fund the employee tax obligations for certain vested stock awards.

Non-GAAP Measures (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA)
We calculate EBITDA by taking GAAP net income and adding back interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and adding back transaction expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation, other income, net, goodwill and intangibles impairment and other adjustments. Transaction expenses represent expenses for legal, accounting, and other professionals that were engaged in the completion of various acquisitions. Transaction expenses can be volatile as they are primarily driven by the size of a specific acquisition. As such, we exclude these amounts from Adjusted EBITDA for comparability across periods. Other adjustments include the adjustments for warrant liabilities revaluation, restructuring costs, extraordinary expenses and gain/loss on currency transactions. As of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we have modified the method in which adjusted EBITDA is calculated by no longer including an add-back for director costs and public company expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 is restated by $0.7 million for these expenses to reflect this change.
We believe these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends related to our financial condition and results of operations, and as a tool for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with competitors who also present similar non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, these measures (1) are used in quarterly and annual financial reports prepared for management and our board of directors and (2) help management to determine incentive compensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as comparative measures.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses described below. As further described below, the Company believes that it has implemented measures that remediate its material weaknesses previously disclosed in its Annual Report; however, due to the nature of the remediation process, the newly implemented controls have not operated effectively for a sufficient period of time for a definitive conclusion.
Remediation of Prior Material Weakness
Management identified and disclosed two material weaknesses in the Company’s Annual Report. Specifically, material weaknesses were identified related to (1) the review of manual journal entries within the financial statement close process, which was identified in connection with the restatement of the Company’s interim unaudited financial statements as of July 31, 2022 ("MW #1"); and (2) the areas of user access and segregation of duties related to information technology systems that support the financial reporting process specifically related to accounts payable and expenditures ("MW #2").
As of January 31, 2023, management implemented measures that it believes remediate the identified material weaknesses. Specifically, for MW #1, controls were implemented and evidenced to ensure that journal entries are adequately reviewed and approved, and for MW #2, the Company has implemented a review of user activity reports and steps to ensure appropriate segregation of duties. Notwithstanding these measures, due to the nature of the remediation process, newly implemented controls must operate effectively for a sufficient period of time for a definitive conclusion, validated through testing, that the deficiencies have been fully remediated and, as such, management can give no assurance that the measures it has undertaken have fully remediated the material weaknesses that it has identified or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Management will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these controls through ongoing tests and will make any further changes that management determines to be appropriate.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Except as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
