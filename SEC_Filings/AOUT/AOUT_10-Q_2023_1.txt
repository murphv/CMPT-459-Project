Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained or incorporated herein by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future operating results, future financial position, business strategy, objectives, goals, plans, prospects, markets, and plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “suggests,” “targets,” “contemplates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “can,” “potential,” “continue,” “objective,” or the negative of those terms, or similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Specific forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements regarding:
• the impact of recently adopted accounting standards on our financial statements and related disclosures;
• our future lease payments;
• our future expected amortization expense;
• our expectation that the unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs and PSUs will be recognized over a weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.2 years;
• our estimate of annual expense under our lease after the assignement of such lease to us, which increase in expense we expect will be entirely offset by savings from recent facility consolidations and efficencies gained in our distribution processes;
• our expectation for increase of right-of-use asset on our consolidated balance sheet when the lease assignment to us is effective and our expectation to receive tax and other incentives from federal, state, and local governmental authorities previously received by our former parent following the assignment of the lease to us;
• the results reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year;
• our belief that Adjusted EBITDAS is useful to understanding our operating results and the ongoing performance of our underlying business, as Adjusted EBITDAS provides information on our ability to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and isalso an indicator of profitability;
• our belief that reporting Adjusted EBITDAS provides additional transparency and comparability to our operating results;
• our belief that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAS is useful to investors because it is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry;
• the availability of equity or debt financing to us on acceptable terms or at all;
• our expectation of spending approximately $6.0 million to $6.5 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2023;
• our expectation for new product introductions that will launch later in the year;
• our future capital requirements' dependency on many factors, including net sales, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the capital needed to operate as an independent publicly traded company, including the establishment of our enterprise resource planning systems, any acquisitions or strategic investments that we may determine to make, our ability to navigate through the business impacts from the coronavirus, or COVID-19 pandemic, and related aftermath, and changes in consumer spending, which is sensitive to economic conditions and other factors;
• the possibility that our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms;
• our expectation to continue to utilize our cash flows to invest in our business, including research and development for new product initiatives; hire additional employees; fund growth strategies, including any potential acquisitions; to make payments on our $10.0 million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit and any indebtedness we may incur over time; implement our enterprise resource planning systems; and to repurchase shares of our common stock where we have authorization to do so;
• our estimation that our information technology infrastructure will cost a total of approximately $8.8 million over a period that spans fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023;
• our expectation for capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 million and one-time operating expenses of approximately $1.7 million in fiscal 2023;
• our expectation to spend approximately $500,000 of duplicative expenses in fiscal 2023 related to our information technology infrastructure and enterprise resource planning platforms in parallel during the system changeover period; and
• our expectation for inventory levels to decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as we reduce our planned inventory pruchases, other than purchases for new product introductions, and a return to typical seasonality trends for our business.
A number of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following:
• potential disruptions in our suppliers’ ability to source the raw materials necessary for the production of our products, disruptions and delays in the manufacture of our products, and difficulties encountered by retailers and other components of the distribution channel for our products including delivery of product stemming from port congestion and related transportation challenges, which may continue to be adversely impacted by the multitude of the effects of COVID-19 and the hostilities in the Ukraine;
• lower levels of consumer spending in general and specific to our products or product categories;
• our ability to introduce new products that are successful in the marketplace;
• interruptions of our arrangements with third-party contract manufacturers and freight carriers that disrupt our ability to fill our customers’ orders;
• increases in costs or decreases in availability of finished products, product components, and raw materials;
• our ability to maintain or strengthen our brand recognition and reputation;
• the ability to forecast demand for our products accurately;
• our ability to continue to expand our e-commerce business;
• our ability to compete in a highly competitive market;
• our dependence on large customers;
• our ability to attract and retain talent;
• an increase of emphasis on private label products by our customers;
• pricing pressures by our customers;
• our ability to collect our accounts receivable;
• the potential for product recalls, product liability, and other claims or lawsuits against us;
• our ability to protect our intellectual property;
• inventory levels, both internally and in the distribution channel, in excess of demand;
• our ability to identify acquisition candidates, to complete acquisitions of potential acquisition candidates, to integrate acquired businesses with our business, to achieve success with acquired companies, and to realize the benefits of acquisitions in a manner consistent with our expectations;
• the performance and security of our information systems;
• our ability to comply with any applicable foreign laws or regulations and the effect of increased protective tariffs;
• economic, social, political, legislative, and regulatory factors;
• the potential for increased regulation of firearms and firearms- related products;
• the effect of political pressures on firearm laws and regulations;
• the potential impact on our business and operations from the results of federal, state, and local elections and the policies that may be implemented as a result thereof;
• our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of being a separate, public company;
• future investments for capital expenditures, liquidity and anticipated cash needs and availability;
• the potential for impairment charges;
• estimated amortization expense of intangible assets for future periods;
• actions of social or economic activists that could, directly or indirectly, have an adverse effect on our business;
• disruptions caused by social unrest, including related protests or disturbances;
• our assessment of factors relating to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, the timing for such evaluations, and the potential adjustment in such evaluations; and
• other factors detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including information contained herein.
All forward-looking statements included herein, or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, are based on information available to us as of their respective dates and speak only as of such dates. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. The forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, reflect our views as of the date of these reports about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and changes in circumstances that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ significantly from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future events, results, performance, or achievements.
We are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act, and we file or furnish reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. Such reports and other information we file with the SEC are available free of charge at https://ir.aob.com/financial-information/sec-filings as soon as practicable after such reports are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

For the Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022
(1) Organization:
We (our “company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are a leading provider of outdoor lifestyle products and shooting sports accessories encompassing hunting, fishing, outdoor cooking, camping, shooting, and personal security and defense products for rugged outdoor enthusiasts. We conceive, design, source, and sell our outdoor lifestyle products, including premium sportsman knives and tools for fishing and hunting; land management tools for hunting preparedness; harvesting products for post-hunt or post-fishing activities; outdoor cooking products; and camping, survival, and emergency preparedness products. We conceive, design, produce or source, and sell our shooting sports accessories, such as rests, vaults, and other related accessories; electro-optical devices, including hunting optics, firearm aiming devices, flashlights, and laser grips; and reloading, gunsmithing, and firearm cleaning supplies.
We develop and market our products at our facility in Columbia, Missouri and contract for the manufacture and assembly of most of our products with third parties located in Asia. We also manufacture our electro-optics products at our facility in Columbia, Missouri. We focus on our brands and the establishment of product categories in which we believe our brands will resonate strongly with the activities and passions of consumers and enable us to capture an increasing share of our overall addressable markets. Our owned brands include BOG, BUBBA, Caldwell, Crimson Trace, Frankford Arsenal, Grilla Grills, Hooyman, Imperial, LaserLyte, Lockdown, MEAT! Your Maker, Old Timer, Schrade, Tipton, Uncle Henry, ust, and Wheeler, and we license for use in association with certain products we sell additional brands, including M&P, Smith & Wesson, Performance Center by Smith & Wesson, and T/C.
In focusing on the growth of our brands, we organize our creative, product development, sourcing, and e-commerce teams into
four
brand lanes, each of which focuses on one of four distinct consumer verticals – Adventurer, Harvester, Marksman, and Defender – with each of our brands included in one of the brand lanes.
• Our Adventurer brands include products that help enhance consumers’ fishing, camping, and outdoor cooking experiences. • Our Harvester brands focus on the activities hunters typically engage in, including the activities to prepare for the hunt, the hunt itself, and the activities that follow a hunt, such as meat processing.
• Our Marksman brands address product needs arising from consumer activities that take place primarily at the shooting range and where firearms are cleaned, maintained, and worked on.
• Our Defender brands include products that help consumers aim their firearms more accurately, including situations that require self-defense, and products that help safely secure and store, as well as maintain connectivity to those possessions that many consumers consider to be high value or high consequence.
(2) Basis of Presentation:
Interim Financial Information Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain disclosures and other financial information that normally are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted. Our accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. We are responsible for the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, which are unaudited but, in our opinion, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2023, our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, and our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.
The consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2022 was derived from audited financial statements.
The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not necessarily be taken as indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year.
Reclassification
Certain immaterial reclassifications were made to the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended January 31, 2022 to reclassify payments to acquire property and equipment, to payments to acquire patents and software; however, the total amount of net cash used in investing activities remained unchanged.
This reclassification had
no
impact on the previously reported net income. 9

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
For the Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022   Insurance Reserves
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, we transitioned to self-insured group health insurance programs. Prior to this transition, we had fully guaranteed cost group health insurance programs. We are now self-insured through retentions or deductibles with stop-loss insurance for medical claims that reach a certain limit per claim. We record our liability for estimated incurred losses based on historical claim data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue for the sale of our products at the point in time when the control of ownership has transferred to the customer. The transfer of control typically occurs at a point in time based on consideration of when the customer has (i) a payment obligation, (ii) physical possession of goods has been received, (iii) legal title to goods has passed, (iv) risks and rewards of ownership of goods has passed to the customer, and (v) the customer has accepted the goods. The timing of revenue recognition occurs either on shipment or delivery of goods based on contractual terms with the customer. The duration of contractual arrangements with customers in our wholesale channels is typically less than one year. Payment terms with customers are typically between
20
and
90 days , with a discount available in certain cases for early payment. For contracts with discounted terms, we determine the transaction price upon establishment of the contract that contains the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product purchased. We estimate variable consideration relative to the amount of cash discounts to which customers are likely to be entitled. In some instances, we provide longer payment terms, particularly as it relates to our hunting dating programs, which represent payment terms due in the fall for certain orders of hunting products received in the spring and summer. We do not consider these extended terms to be a significant financing component of the contract because the payment terms are less than one year. We have elected to treat all shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs and recognize the costs as distribution expenses at the time we recognize the related revenue. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales. The amount of revenue we recognize reflects the expected consideration to be received for providing the goods or services to customers, which includes estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration includes allowances for trade term discounts, chargebacks, and product returns. Estimates of variable consideration are determined at contract inception and reassessed at each reporting date, at a minimum, to reflect any changes in facts and circumstances. We apply the portfolio approach as a practical expedient and utilize the expected value method in determining estimates of variable consideration, based on evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, historical and anticipated trends, and current economic conditions. We have co-op advertising program expense, which we record within advertising expense, in recognition of a distinct service that we receive from our customers at the retail level.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards   In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, or ASU 2020-04, to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the contract modifications, hedge relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04, which was effective upon issuance and may be applied through December 31, 2022, is applicable to all contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or any other reference rate expected to be discontinued. As a result of the amendment to the revolving line of credit agreement in fiscal year 2022, which uses SOFR as an interest rate option instead of LIBOR to calculate the applicable interest rate, see
Note 8 - Debt,
the new guidance will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   In December 2019, FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, or ASU 2019-12, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
ASU 2019-12
simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions for intraperiod tax allocations and deferred tax liabilities for equity method investments and adds guidance regarding whether a step-up in tax basis of goodwill relates to a business combination or a separate transaction. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We
adopted
ASU 2019-12 on
May 1, 2021 , and the cumulative effect of the adoption was
no t material to our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
(3) Acquisitions:
Grilla Grills Acquisition In fiscal 2022, we acquired substantially all of the assets of the Grilla Grills business of Fahrenheit Technologies, Inc., or FTI, for $ 27
million, financed using a combination of existing cash balances and cash from a $ 25
million draw on our revolving line of credit. Based in Michigan, Grilla Grills is a provider of high-quality, barbecue grills; Wi-Fi-enabled wood pellet grills; smokers; accessories; and modular outdoor kitchens.
We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the net assets received was recorded as goodwill. The factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill primarily relate to acquisition-driven anticipated cost savings and synergies. Assembled workforce is not recognized separate and apart from goodwill as it is neither separable nor contractual in nature.
During the year ended April 30, 2022, we increased goodwill by $ 3.5
million as a result of valuations related to the Grilla Grills acquisition, which was subsequently written off as we recorded a full impairment of our goodwill on April 30, 2022.
The goodwill related to the Grilla Grills acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
The valuation of the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in the Grilla Grills acquisition is complete. 11

m illion and $ 11.4
million of net sales during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, respectively. We determined the fair market value of the intangible assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805 -
Business Combinations
and ASC 820 -
Fair Value Measurement
and assigned a fair market value of $ 18.5
million to tradenames at the acquisition date.
We amortize assets in proportion to expected yearly revenue generated from the intangibles that we acquire.
The weighted average life of tradenames acquired is
6.5
years.
Additionally, the following table reflects the unaudited pro forma results of operations assuming that the Grilla Grills acquisition had occurred on May 1, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data):

The unaudited pro forma income from operations for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022 has been adjusted to reflect increased cost of goods sold from the fair value step-up in inventory, which is expensed over the first inventory cycle, and the amortization of intangibles as if the Grilla Grills acquisition had occurred on May 1, 2021.
The unaudited pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved had the Grilla Grills acquisition occurred as of May 1, 2021 or the results that may be achieved in future periods.
(4) Leases:
We lease real estate, as well as other equipment, under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. We recognize expenses under our operating lease assets and liabilities at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease terms. Our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease agreements do not require material variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, or restrictive covenants. For operating leases, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We record tenant improvement allowances as an offsetting adjustment included in our calculation of the respective right-of-use asset.
Many of our leases include renewal options that can extend the lease term. These renewal options are at our sole discretion and are reflected in the lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. 12

For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, we recorded $ 1.1
million and $ 3.1
million, respectively, of operating lease costs, of which $ 43,000
and $ 131,000 , respectively, were short-term operating lease costs. For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, we recorded $ 934,000
and $ 2.8
million, respectively, of operating lease costs, of which $ 57,000
and $ 158,000 , respectively, were short-term operating lease costs.
As of January 31, 2023, our weighted average lease term and weighted average discount rate for our operating leases were
15.7
years and
5.4 %, respectively. The operating lease costs, weighted average lease term, and weighted average discount rate are primarily driven by the sublease of our corporate office and warehouse facility in Columbia, Missouri through fiscal 2039. The depreciable lives of right-of-use assets are limited by the lease term and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, we amended the existing operating lease for our corporate office and warehouse facility in Columbia, Missouri to expand our usable square footage in our warehouse.
The term of the lease remains unchanged, through fiscal 2039.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, we recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability of $ 1.9
million.   During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, we terminated an operating lease for warehouse and office space in Wilsonville, Oregon.
We recorded a reduction of right-of-use asset and lease liability of approximately $ 837,000
for terminating this lease.   On January 31, 2023, we entered into an Assignment and Assumption of Lease Agreement (the "Assignment Agreement") with our former parent company and RCS - S&W Facility, LLC to obtain the rights of lease to the entire facility in Columbia, Missouri, subject to certain conditions.

(6) Fair Value Measurement: We follow the provisions of ASC 820-10,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic , or ASC 820-10, for our financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1
— Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access at the measurement date (examples include active exchange-traded equity securities, listed derivatives, and most U.S. Government and agency securities). 14
AMERICAN OUTDOORS BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
For the Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022   Our cash and cash equivalents, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, totaled $ 21.7
million as of January 31, 2023 and $ 19.5
million as of April 30, 2022.
Cash and cash equivalents are reported at fair value based on market prices for identical assets in active markets, and therefore classified as Level 1 of the value hierarchy. Level 2
— Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets in which trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices of instruments with similar attributes in active markets. Level 2 inputs include the following: • quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (such as corporate and municipal bonds which trade infrequently); • inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (such as interest rate and currency swaps); and • inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (such as certain securities and derivatives). The carrying value of our revolving line of credit approximated the fair value, as of January 31, 2023, in considering Level 2 inputs within the hierarchy.
Level 3
— Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
We currently do
no t have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of January 31, 2023.

(8) Debt:
On August 24, 2020, we entered into a financing arrangement consisting of a $ 50.0
million revolving line of credit secured by substantially all our assets, maturing
five years
from the closing date, with available borrowings determined by a borrowing base calculation. The revolving line included an option to increase the credit commitment by an additional $ 15
million.
The revolving line bore interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the Base Rate or LIBOR, as applicable, plus the applicable margin.
On March 25, 2022, we amended our secured loan and security agreement, or the Amended Loan and Security Agreement, increasing the revolving line of credit to $ 75
million, secured by substantially all our assets, maturing in
March 2027 , with available borrowings determined by a borrowing base calculation.
The amendment also includes an option to increase the credit commitment by an additional $ 15
million.
The amended revolving line bears interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the Base Rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as applicable, plus the applicable margin.
The applicable margin can range from a minimum of
0.25 % to a maximum of
1.75 % based on certain conditions as defined in the Amended Loan and Security Agreement. The financing arrangement contains covenants relating to minimum debt service coverage.
As of January 31, 2023, we had $ 10.0
million of borrowings outstanding on the amended revolving line of credit, which bore interest at
5.58 %, equal to SOFR plus the applicable margin.
Outstanding borrowings on the revolving line of credit are classified as non-current in the consolidated financial statements, maturing in
March 2027 .
The proceeds from the borrowings on our revolving line of credit were used to purchase the Grilla Grills branded products from FTI in fiscal year 2022.

(9) Equity:
Treasury Stock
On September 30, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 10.0
million of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, in the open market, in block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions, executable through
September 29, 2023 .
During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, under this authorization, we repurchased
191,632
shares and
275,661
shares, respectively, of our common stock for $ 1.8
million and $ 2.6
million, respectively, utilizing cash on hand. Earnings per Share
We compute diluted earnings per share by giving effect to all potentially dilutive stock awards that are outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock-based awards when the effect of the potential exercise would be anti-dilutive. There were
no
shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, respectively.
Due to the loss from operations for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, there are
no
common shares added to calculate dilutive earnings per share because the effect would be antidilutive. The following table provides a reconciliation of the net income amounts and weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares used to determine basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except per share data):

Incentive Stock and Employee Stock Purchase Plans
We have a stock incentive plan, or 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan, under which we can grant new awards to our employees and directors. Our 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan authorizes the issuance of awards covering up to
1,397,510
shares of our common stock. The plan permits the grant of options to acquire common stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, or RSUs, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock and awards in lieu of obligations, performance awards, and dividend equivalents. Our Board of Directors, or a committee established by our Board of Directors, administers the plan, selects recipients to whom awards are granted, and determines the grants to be awarded. Stock options granted under the plan are exercisable at a price determined by our Board of Directors or a committee thereof at the time of grant, but in no event, less than fair market value of our common stock on the date granted. Grants of options may be made to employees and directors without regard to any performance measures. All options issued pursuant to the plan are generally nontransferable and subject to forfeiture.
Unless terminated earlier by our Board of Directors, our 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan will terminate at the earliest of (1) the tenth anniversary of the effective date of our 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan, or (2) such time as
no
shares of common stock remain available for issuance under the plan and we have no further rights or obligations with respect to outstanding awards under the plan. The date of grant of an award is deemed to be the date upon which our Board of Directors or a committee thereof authorizes the granting of such award. Except in specific circumstances, grants generally vest over a period of
three
or
four years
and grants of stock options are exercisable for a period of
10 years . Our 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan also permits the grant of awards to non-employees.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
For the Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022   We recognized $ 1.1
million and $ 2.9
million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, respectively.
We recognized $ 918,000
and $ 2.3
million of stock-based compensation expenses for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, respectively. We include stock-based compensation expense in the cost of sales, sales marketing and distribution, research and development, and general and administrative expenses.
We grant RSUs to employees and directors. The awards are made at no cost to the recipient. An RSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock and does not carry voting or dividend rights.
Except in specific circumstances,
RSU grants to employees generally vest over a period of
four years
with one-fourth of the units vesting on each anniversary of the grant date.
We amortize the aggregate fair value of our RSU grants to compensation expense over the vesting period. Awards that do not vest are forfeited. We grant performance stock units, or PSUs, to our executive officers and certain other employees from time to time. At the time of grant, we calculate the fair value of our PSUs using the Monte-Carlo simulation.
We incorporate the following variables into the valuation model:

three-year
performance period. (d) We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
The PSUs vest, and the fair value of such PSUs will be recognized, over the corresponding
three-year
performance period. Our PSUs have a maximum aggregate award equal to
200 % of the target unit amount granted. Generally, the number of PSUs that may be earned depends upon the total stockholder return, or TSR, of our common stock compared with the TSR of the Russell 2000 Index, or the RUT, over the three-year performance period. For PSUs, our stock must outperform the RUT by
5 % in order for the target award to vest. In addition, there is a cap on the number of shares that can be earned under our PSUs, which is equal to six times the grant-date value of each award. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, we granted an aggregate of
52,277
PSUs to our executive officers. We also granted
264,898
RSUs during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, including
52,277
RSUs to executive officers and
212,621
RSUs to non-executive officer employees and directors under our 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan. In addition, in connection with a 2019 grant, we vested
7,200
PSUs (i.e., the target amount granted), which achieved
200 % of the maximum aggregate award possible, resulting in awards totaling
14,400
shares to certain of our executive officers and employees of our former parent. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, we cancelled
7,094
RSUs as a result of the service condition not being met. In connection with the vesting of RSUs, during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, we delivered common stock to our employees, including our executive officers, and directors with a total market value of $ 1.3
million.

For the Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022   During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, we granted an aggregate of
26,809
market-condition PSUs to our executive officers. We also granted
75,387
service-based RSUs during the nine months ended January 31, 2022, including
28,948
RSUs to executive officers and
46,439
to non-executive officer employees under our 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan. In addition, in connection with a 2018 grant, we vested

market-condition PSUs (i.e., the target amount granted), which achieved
200 % of the maximum aggregate award possible, resulting in awards totaling
21,600
shares to certain of our executive officers and employees of our former parent. During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, we cancelled

As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 2.6

1.2
years.
We have an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, which authorizes the sale of up to
419,253
shares of our common stock to employees. All options and rights to participate in our ESPP are nontransferable and subject to forfeiture in accordance with our ESPP guidelines. Our current ESPP will be implemented in a series of successive offering periods, each with a maximum duration of
12 months . If the fair market value per share of our common stock on any purchase date is less than the fair market value per share on the start date of a 12-month offering period, then that offering period will automatically terminate and a new 12-month offering period will begin on the next business day. Each offering period will begin on April 1 or October 1, as applicable, immediately following the end of the previous offering period. Payroll deductions will be on an after-tax basis, in an amount of not less than
1 % and not more than
20 % (or such greater percentage as the committee appointed to administer our ESPP may establish from time to time before the first day of an offering period) of a participant’s compensation on each payroll date. The option exercise price per share will equal
85 % of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or the fair market value on the exercise date. The maximum number of shares that a participant may purchase during any purchase period is the greater of
2,500
shares, or a total of $ 25,000
in shares, based on the fair market value on the first day of the offering period. Our ESPP will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) the exercise date that participants become entitled to purchase a number of shares greater than the number of reserved shares available for purchase under our ESPP, (b) such date as is determined by our Board of Directors in its discretion, or (c) the tenth anniversary of the effective date. In the event of certain corporate transactions, each option outstanding under our ESPP will be assumed or an equivalent option will be substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023,
38,560
shares were purchased by our employees under our ESPP.
We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
We amortize the fair value of the award over the vesting period of the option.
Under ESPP, fair value is determined at the beginning of the purchase period and amortized over the term of each exercise period. The following assumptions were used in valuing ESPP purchases under our ESPP during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022:

Income Taxes:
The income tax (benefit)/expense included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations is based upon the estimated effective tax rate for the year, adjusted for the impact of discrete items which are accounted for in the period in which they occur. We recorded income tax benefit of $ 125,000
and income tax expense of $ 1.1
million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022
was
4.2 % and
23.4 %, respectively.
Income tax benefit for the three months ended January 31, 2023 included a discrete tax benefit of $ 127,000
associated with
return to provision adjustments relating to the Federal tax return filed for the prior fiscal year.
We recorded income tax benefit of $ 98,000
and income tax expense of $ 3.3
million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was
1.2 % and
21.8 %, respectively.
Income tax benefit for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 included a discrete tax benefit of $ 127,000
associated with return to provision adjustments relating to the Federal tax return filed for the prior fiscal year.
Income tax expense for the nine months ended January 31, 2022 included a discrete tax benefit of $ 363,000
associated with stock-based compensation.
(12) Commitments and Contingencies: Litigation From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including those relating to product liability, intellectual property, commercial relationships, employment issues, and governmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we did not incur any material expenses in defense and administrative costs relative to product liability litigation. In addition, we did not incur any settlement fees related to product liability cases in those fiscal years.
Gain Contingency   In 2018, the United States imposed additional section 301 tariffs of up to
25 %, on certain goods imported from China. These additional section 301 tariffs apply to our sourced products from China and have added additional cost to us. We are utilizing the duty drawback mechanism to offset some of the direct impact of these tariffs, specifically on goods that we sold internationally. We are accounting for duty drawbacks as a gain contingency and may record any such gain from a reimbursement in future periods if and when the contingency is resolved.   19

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
For the Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022   Assignment and Assumption Agreement
On January 31, 2023, we entered an Assignment Agreement with our former parent company and RCS – S&W Facility, LLC to assign to us the rights of the tenant under the Lease Agreement, dated October 26, 2017, as amended by the First Amendment of Lease Agreement, dated October 25, 2018, and as further amended by the Second Amendment to Lease Agreement, dated January 31, 2019 (collectively, the “Lease”), which assignment will be effective on January 1, 2024, subject to certain conditions.
The Lease covers approximately
632,000
square feet of building and surrounding property located at 1800 North Route Z, Columbia, Boone County, Missouri (the “Building”) where we currently sublease approximately
361,000
square feet from our former parent company (the “Sublease”). If the conditions precedent set forth in the Assignment Agreement are satisfied, then effective on January 1, 2024, we will no longer be subject to the provisions and terms of the Sublease, but instead we will have use of the entire Building under the Lease. The Lease provides the tenant with an option to expand the Building by up to
491,000
additional square feet. The Lease term ends on
November 26, 2038
and, pursuant to the Assignment Agreement,
does not provide for an extension of the term of the Lease .
Upon the effectiveness of the Lease assignment, the total annual expense under the Lease, including base rent, is estimated at $ 3.7
million, which represents an incremental $ 1.3
million above our annual expense under the Sublease, which we expect will be entirely offset by savings from recent facility consolidations and efficiencies gained in our distribution processes. We expect an increase of $ 12.8
million will be recorded as a right-of-use asset on our consolidated balance sheet, when effective.
We also expect to receive tax and other incentives from federal, state, and local governmental authorities previously received by our former parent. Our former parent will guarantee the Lease through the end of the term.
(13) Segment Reporting:
We have evaluated our operations under ASC 280-10-50-1 – Segment Reporting and have concluded that we are operating as
one
segment based on several key factors, including the reporting and review process used by the chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews only consolidated financial information and makes decisions to allocate resources based on those financial statements. We analyze revenue streams in various ways, including customer group, brands, product categories, and customer channels. However, this information does not include a full set of discrete financial information. In addition, although we currently sell our products under
21
distinct brands that are organized into
four
brand lanes and include specific product sales that have identified revenue streams, these brand lanes are focused almost entirely on product development and marketing activities and do not qualify as separate reporting units under ASC 280-10-50-1. Other sales and customer focused activities, operating activities, and administrative activities are not divided by brand lane and, therefore, expenses related to each brand lane are not accumulated or reviewed individually. Our business is evaluated based upon a number of financial and operating measures, including sales, gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, and operating margin. Our business includes our outdoor products and accessories products as well as our electro-optics products, which we develop, source, market, assemble, and distribute from our facility in Columbia, Missouri facility. We report operating costs based on the activities performed.

For the three months ended January 31, 2023, total net sales decreased $19.2 million, or 27.4%, from the comparable quarter last year.
Net sales in our e-commerce channel decreased $10.9 million, or 30.8%, from the comparable quarter last year, primarily as a result of lower net sales to the world’s largest e-commerce retailer because of reduced demand primarily in our shooting sports category as well as their efforts to reduce their overall inventory. The lower net sales to our online retailers were partially offset by a 37.5% increase in our direct-to-consumer net sales over the comparable quarter last year, primarily in our outdoor lifestyle products, and which also include sales resulting from the acquisition of Grilla Grills. We believe the increase in our direct-to-consumer net sales represents the demand for our products in the market that are not typically hindered by retailer inventory management. Our brands that are only sold on our direct-to-consumer websites represented $7.2 million, or 29.3%, of total e-commerce channel net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023, which includes net sales from a business acquisition completed in the prior fiscal year.
Net sales in our traditional channels decreased $8.3 million, or 23.9%, from the comparable quarter last year, primarily because of lower net sales for most of our products as a result of decreased orders from retailers, which we believe was caused by a combination of lower foot traffic because of less discretionary consumer spending and retailers’ efforts to reduce their overall inventory levels. In addition, lower net sales of our shooting sports products to our OEM customers resulted in lower traditional channel net sales from the comparable quarter last year.
Our international net sales declined primarily because of reduced demand for our shooting sports products and timing of customer shipments.
New products, which we define as any SKU introduced over the prior two fiscal years, represented 23.9% of net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023.
Gross margin for the three months ended January 31, 2023 increased 130 basis points over the comparable quarter last year, primarily because of lower freight and tariff expenses from the planned reduction in inventory purchases, new product introductions that typically have higher gross margins, and favorable valuation provisions on inventory, partially offset by product and customer mix and promotional product discounts that are consistent with pre-pandemic promotional discount levels.

For the nine months ended January 31, 2023, total net sales decreased $52.6 million, or 26.1%, from the prior year comparable period.
Net sales in our e-commerce channel decreased $11.8 million, or 14.8%, from the prior year comparable period, primarily as a result of lower net sales in our shooting sports category, almost entirely offset by increased net sales in our outdoor lifestyle category that included a 99.4% increase in direct-to-consumer net sales over the prior year comparable period, which also include sales resulting from the acquisition of Grilla Grills. Our brands that are only sold on our direct-to-consumer websites represented $18.9 million, or 27.8%, of total e-commerce channel net sales for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, which included net sales from a business acquisition completed in the prior fiscal year.
Net sales in our traditional channels decreased $40.8 million, or 33.4%, from the prior year comparable period, primarily because of lower net sales for most of our products as a result of decreased orders from retailers, which we believe was caused by a combination of lower foot traffic in stores mentioned above and retailers’ efforts to reduce their overall inventory levels. In addition, traditional channel net sales were impacted by lower net sales of our shooting sports products to our OEM customers. We believe the decrease in traditional channel net sales was a result of a build in traditional channel inventories of our products during the first fiscal quarter last year as certain customers accelerated their purchases to offset the possibility of delays caused by global supply chain disruptions. Our international net sales declined primarily becuase of reduced demand for our shooting sports products and timing of customer shipments.
New products, which we define as any SKU introduced over the prior two fiscal years, represented 27.7% of net sales for the nine months ended January 31, 2023.
Gross margin for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 decreased 40 basis points from the prior year comparable period primarily because of lower sales volumes, product and customer mix, and increased promotional product discounts that are consistent with pre-pandemic promotional discount levels, partially offset by favorable impacts of price increases and tariff drawbacks.

Research and development expenses increased $533,000 primarily related to increased compensation-related expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $1.6 million over the prior year comparable period, primarily as a result of $1.2 million of legal and advisory fees associated with the completed cooperation agreement with a stockholder and $374,000 of increased standalone expenses, such as our information technology infrastructure costs and subscription and software costs, partially offset by lower compensation-related expenses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
We use GAAP net income as our primary financial measure. We use Adjusted EBITDAS, which is a non-GAAP financial metric, as a supplemental measure of our performance in order to provide investors with an improved understanding of underlying performance trends, and it should be considered in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAS is defined as GAAP net income/(loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense. Our Adjusted EBITDAS calculation also excludes certain items we consider non-routine. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAS is useful to understanding our operating results and the ongoing performance of our underlying business, as Adjusted EBITDAS provides information on our ability to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and is also an indicator of profitability. We believe this reporting provides additional transparency and comparability to our operating results. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAS is useful to investors because it is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We use Adjusted EBITDAS to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to neutralize our capitalization structure to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures, especially companies that are private. We also use Adjusted EBITDAS to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate our performance in connection with compensation decisions. We believe it is useful to investors and analysts to evaluate this non-GAAP measure on the same basis as we use to evaluate our operating results.
Adjusted EBITDAS is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We address the limitations of non-GAAP measures through the use of various GAAP measures. In the future, we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDAS. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAS should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items.
The following table sets forth our calculation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDAS for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (dollars in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We expect to continue to utilize our cash flows to invest in our business, including research and development for new product initiatives; hire additional employees; fund growth strategies, including any potential acquisitions; to make payments on our borrowings under our revolving line of credit, and any additional indebtedness we may incur over time; implement our enterprise resource planning systems; and to repurchase shares of our common stock if we are authorized to do so. We estimate that our information technology infrastructure will cost a total of approximately $8.8 million over a period that spans fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, we recorded capital expenditures of $3.9 million and one-time operating expenses of $1.0 million. In fiscal 2023, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 million and one-time operating expenses of approximately $1.7 million. In addition, we recorded $948,000 of duplicative expenses in fiscal 2022 and we expect to spend approximately $500,000 of duplicative expenses in fiscal 2023, as we operated both our existing and our new information technology and enterprise resource planning platforms in parallel during the system changeover period. The one-time operating expenses and duplicative expenses will be recorded in general and administrative expenses on our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Operating Activities
On an annual basis, operating activities generally represent the principal source of our cash flow.
Cash generated by operating activities was $24.3 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared with cash used in operating activities of $26.2 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2022. Cash generated by operating activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily impacted by $16.2 million of reduced inventory as a result of a planned reduction in purchases during the period, offset by additional purchases for new product introductions that will launch later in the year. In addition, accounts receivable decreased by $3.7 million due to timing of payments from our customers and $2.2 million of increased accrued expenses which was primarily because of timing of payments for sales volume accruals. The cash generated during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was partially offset by $2.8 million of reduced accounts payable because of the planned reduction in purchases mentioned above.
We expect our inventory levels to decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as we reduce our planned inventory purchases, other than purchases for new product introductions, and a return to typical seasonality trends for our business.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $480,000 lower during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 as compared with the prior year comparable period primarily from lower spending on tooling fixtures. We expect to spend approximately $6.0 million to $6.5 million of capital expenditures in fiscal 2023, a decrease of $600,000 to $100,000 from fiscal 2022, which includes the capital expenditures for the development and implementation of our independent information technology infrastructure noted above. We recorded spending of $1.8 million of capital expenditures during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 related to our development and implementation of our independent information technology infrastructure.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities was $17.8 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, primarily from $15.2 million of payments on our revolving line of credit and $2.6 million of payments to repurchase our common stock under an authorized stock repurchase program.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including net sales, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the capital needed to operate as an independent publicly traded company, including the establishment of our enterprise resource planning systems, any acquisitions or strategic investments that we may determine to make, our ability to navigate through the many negative business impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and related aftermath, and changes in consumer spending, which is sensitive to economic conditions and other factors. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained.
We had $21.7 million of cash equivalents on hand as of January 31, 2023 and had $19.5 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as of April 30, 2022.
