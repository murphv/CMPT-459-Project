Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Medtronic plc and its subsidiaries (Medtronic plc, Medtronic, or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements include all the adjustments necessary for a fair statement in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the fiscal year as a whole. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
The COVID-19 pandemic ("COVID-19" or the "pandemic") has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and its future impacts remain uncertain and unpredictable. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, changes in the Company’s assessment about the length and severity of the pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in actual results differing from estimates.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medtronic plc, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Amounts reported in millions within this quarterly report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022.
The Company’s fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 will end or ended on April 28, 2023, April 29, 2022, and April 30, 2021, respectively. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year. 2 .
New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted For the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, there were no newly adopted accounting pronouncements that had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. As of January 27, 2023, there are no recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements that are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements . 3.

Acquisitions and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale During the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022, the Company had acquisitions that were accounted for as business combinations. The assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were recorded and consolidated on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to future, yet to be defined technologies, new customer relationships, existing workforce of the acquired businesses, and synergies expected to arise after the Company's acquisition of these businesses. The pro forma impact of these acquisitions was not significant, either individually or in the aggregate, to the consolidated results of the Company for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of income since the date each business was acquired. For the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, purchase price allocation adjustments were not significant.

research and development expense
in the consolidated statements of income. Contingent Consideration Certain of the Company’s business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. A liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is recognized within
other operating (income) expense, net
in the consolidated statements of income. The fair value of contingent consideration at January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022 was $ 308
million and $ 119
million,
respectively. At January 27, 2023, $ 137

Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liability. For projected fiscal year of payment, the amount represents the median of the inputs and is not a weighted average. Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale On May 25, 2022, the Company and DaVita Inc. (“DaVita”) entered into a definitive agreement for the Company to sell half of its Renal Care Solutions (RCS) business. This sale is part of an agreement between Medtronic and DaVita to form a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company (“NewCo”) with equal equity ownership. As a result of entering into the definitive agreement and as of that date, the RCS business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth fiscal quarter, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. RCS is part of the Company’s Medical Surgical portfolio. The Company recorded non-cash pre-tax charges $ 81  million, primarily related to impairment of goodwill and changes in the carrying amount of the disposal group, in the nine months ended January 27, 2023, recognized in

The Company holds investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, investments accounted for under the equity method, and other investments. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are measured using quoted market prices. Equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair values are included within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. To determine the fair value of these investments, the Company uses all pertinent financial information available related to the investees, including financial statements, market participant valuations from recent and proposed equity offerings, and other third-party data.

days. Borrowings under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement bear interest at the TIBOR Rate (as defined in the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement) plus a margin of
0.40 % per annum. Medtronic plc and Medtronic, Inc. have guaranteed the obligations of Medtronic Luxco under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement. In May and June 2022, Medtronic Luxco borrowed an aggregate of ¥ 297  billion, or approximately $ 2.3  billion, of the term loan, under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement. The Company used the net proceeds of the borrowings to fund the early redemption of $ 1.9  billion of Medtronic Inc.'s
3.500 % Senior Notes due 2025 for $ 1.9  billion of total consideration, and $ 368  million of Medtronic Luxco's
3.350 % Senior Notes due 2027 for $ 376  million of total consideration. The Company recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $ 53  million in the three months ended July 29, 2022, which primarily includes cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss was recognized in
interest expense, net
in the consolidated statements of income during the nine months ended January 27, 2023. Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value At January 27, 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes was $ 22.7
billion compared to a principal value of $ 25.3
billion. At April 29, 2022, the estimated fair value was $ 22.9
billion compared to a principal value of $ 24.2
billion. The fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the publicly registered Senior Notes, which are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values and principal values consider the terms of the related debt and exclude the impacts of debt discounts and hedging activity. 8 .
Derivatives and Currency Exchange Risk Management
The Company uses operational and economic hedges, including currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk related to certain debt. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, the Company enters into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The Company also uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on net investments in foreign currency-denominated operations. Currencies of our derivative instruments include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, and others. The Company does not enter into currency exchange rate derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding was $ 19.6
billion and $ 13.8
billion at January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022, respectively.
The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by the Company, reasons the Company uses such instruments, and the impact such instruments have on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. Freestanding Derivative Contracts Freestanding derivative contracts are primarily used to offset the Company’s exposure to the change in value of specific foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, and to offset variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The gross notional amount of the Company's freestanding currency exchange rate contracts outstanding at January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022 was $ 5.4
billion and $ 4.9
billion, respectively. The Company's freestanding currency exchange rate contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign-currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows.
The Company also uses total return swaps to hedge the liability of a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The gross notional amount of the Company's total return swaps outstanding at January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022 was $ 222
million and $ 226
million, respectively. The Company's total return swaps are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these instruments are recognized in
18 Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) earnings. The cash flows related to the Company's freestanding derivative contracts are reported as operating or financing activities, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged item, in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash Flow Hedges Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. The gross notional amount of these contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, outstanding at January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022 was $ 9.3
billion and $ 8.8
billion, respectively, and will mature within the subsequent
three-year
period. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss . The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings and is included in
other operating (income) expense, net
or
cost of products sold
in the consolidated statements of income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts excluded from the measurement of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. The cash flows related to all of the Company's derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. At January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022, the Company had $ 92
million and $ 474
million in after-tax net unrealized gains, respectively, associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss . The Company expects that $ 179
million of after-tax net unrealized gains at January 27, 2023 will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the next 12 months. Net Investment Hedges The Company has designated Euro-denominated and Yen-denominated debt as net investment hedges of certain of its European and Japanese operations to manage the exposure to currency and exchange rate movements for foreign currency-denominated net investments in foreign operations. At January 27, 2023, the Company had € 16.0
billion, or $ 17.4
billion, of outstanding Euro-denominated debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its European operations, and ¥ 297
billion, or $ 2.3
billion, of outstanding Yen-denominated debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its Japanese operations. The Euro-denominated debt will mature in fiscal year s 2023 through 2051, and the Yen-denominated debt will mature in fiscal year 2024.
The Company may also use derivative instruments to hedge the currency risk associated with its net investment in foreign operations. Foreign currency forward contracts may be used on a standalone basis or in combination with option collars. At January 27, 2023, the Company had foreign currency contracts with a notional value of € 4.5
billion, or $ 4.9
billion, hedging a portion of its net investment in certain of its European operations. The foreign exchange contracts mature in fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
For instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the gains or losses are reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss . The gains or losses are reclassified into earnings upon a liquidation event or deconsolidation of the foreign subsidiary. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in
interest expense, net
on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. During the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, the Company recognized $ 26
million and $ 74
million in after-tax unrealized gains representing excluded components in
interest expense, net . The cash flows related to the Company's derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows attributable to amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment:
(in millions) Cardiovascular Medical Surgical Neuroscience Diabetes Total April 29, 2022 $ 7,160   $ 19,957   $ 11,132   $ 2,254   $ 40,502   Goodwill as a result of acquisitions 726   —   615   —   1,340   Purchase accounting adjustments ( 10 ) —   ( 3 ) —   ( 13 ) Transfer to held for sale —   ( 208 ) —   —   ( 208 ) Currency translation and other ( 1 ) ( 44 ) ( 12 ) 1   ( 56 ) January 27, 2023 $ 7,874   $ 19,705   $ 11,732   $ 2,255   $ 41,565   The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The test for impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make several estimates related to projected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the goodwill reporting units. The Company calculates the excess of each reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount, including goodwill, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. Internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans are used as a basis for the cash flow analysis. The Company also utilizes assumptions for working capital, capital expenditures, and terminal growth rates. The discount rate applied to the cash flow analysis is based on the weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") for each reporting unit. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The Company did
no t recognize any goodwill impairments during the three months ended January 27, 2023 and the three and nine months ended January 28, 2022. As a result of the agreement with DaVita, as disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company allocated $ 208  million of goodwill to the RCS business that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Upon allocation, a goodwill impairment test was performed for the RCS business, and the Company recognized $ 61
million of goodwill impairment during the nine months ended January 27, 2023. The goodwill impairment charges are recognized in
other operating (income) expense, net
in the consolidated statements of income.
Intangible Assets
The following table presents the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets:

no t recognize any definite-lived intangible asset charges during the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 and the three months ended January 28, 2022. During the nine months ended January 28, 2022, the Company recognized $ 409  million of definite-lived intangible asset charges in connection with MCS within the Cardiovascular Portfolio. Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on what led to the impairment. Intangible asset impairment charges are recognized in
other operating (income) expense, net
in the consolidated statements of income. 23 Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments were
not
significant for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022. Due to the nature of IPR&D projects, the Company may experience future delays or failures to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, failures of clinical trials, delays or failures to obtain required market clearances, other failures to achieve a commercially viable product, or the discontinuation of certain projects, and as a result, may recognize impairment losses in the future. Amortization Expense Intangible asset amortization expense for the three months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022 was $ 431  million and $ 432  million, respectively. Intangible asset amortization expense for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022 was $ 1.3
billion.
Estimated aggregate amortization expense by fiscal year based on the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets at January 27, 2023, excluding any possible future amortization associated with acquired IPR&D which has not yet met technological feasibility, is as follows: (in millions) Amortization Expense Remaining 2023 $ 421   2024 1,653   2025 1,631   2026 1,617   2027 1,593   2028 1,542   11 .
Income Taxes
On August 18, 2022, the U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) issued its opinion on the previously disclosed litigation regarding the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 (Opinion). While the Opinion rejected the IRS’s position and the Tax Court determined the methodology advanced by Medtronic was appropriate for purposes of determining the intercompany royalty rate between Puerto Rico and the U.S., it determined that the royalty rate should be higher, thereby increasing income allocated to the U.S. and consequently subject to U.S. tax. This case relates only to fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Opinion remains subject to finalization by the Tax Court and to appeal by either or both parties. The Company has assumed the Tax Court findings will be applied for all years following fiscal year 2006. As a result, the Company recorded a $ 764  million net tax charge during the three months ended October 28, 2022 to recognize the estimated tax impact of the Tax Court Opinion.
The Company's effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 was
10.6 % and
31.9 %, respectively, as compared to
6.7 % and
8.8 % for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2022, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended January 27, 2023, as compared to the three months ended January 28, 2022, primarily relates to the deferred tax impact associated with a step up in basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes recorded during the three months ended January 28, 2022. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended January 27, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended January 28, 2022 primarily relates to the $ 764  million net tax charge referenced above, and the deferred tax impact associated with a step up in basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes recorded during the prior fiscal year.
At January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 2.6  billion and $ 1.7  billion, respectively. In addition, the Company had accrued gross interest and penalties of $ 56  million at January 27, 2023. If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, approximately $ 2.4  billion would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. At January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022, the amount of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits, net of cash advance, recorded as a noncurrent liability within
accrued income taxes
on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 1.7  billion and $ 802  million, respectively. The increase in the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits, net of cash advance, was primarily due to an increase in unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Tax Court Opinion. During the three months ended January 27, 2023, the Company made a $ 300  million cash deposit with the Internal Revenue Service. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income and records the liability within either current or noncurrent
accrued income taxes
on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the status of current tax audits and proceedings. 12 .
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding, increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive ordinary shares been issued, and reduced by the number of shares the Company could have
24 Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) repurchased with the proceeds from issuance of the potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares include stock-based awards granted under stock-based compensation plans and shares committed to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.
The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:   Three months ended Nine months ended (in millions, except per share data) January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 Numerator:     Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 1,222   $ 1,480   $ 2,579   $ 3,554   Denominator:     Basic – weighted average shares outstanding 1,330.2   1,343.7   1,329.6   1,344.4   Effect of dilutive securities:     Employee stock options 0.8   5.2   1.7   7.3   Employee restricted stock units 0.8   1.3   1.0   1.8   Employee performance share units 0.2   0.1   0.5   0.5   Diluted – weighted average shares outstanding 1,332.0   1,350.3   1,332.8   1,353.9   Basic earnings per share $ 0.92   $ 1.10   $ 1.94   $ 2.64   Diluted earnings per share $ 0.92   $ 1.10   $ 1.94   $ 2.63   The calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding excludes options to purchase approximately
28
million and
23
million ordinary shares for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, respectively, and
6
million and
4
million ordinary shares for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2022, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive on the Company’s earnings per share.

no
income tax on realized gains and losses on investment securities reclassified from AOCI. When realized, gains and losses on investment securities reclassified from AOCI are recognized within  other non-operating income, net . Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. For the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022, the income tax on cumulative translation adjustment was a benefit of $ 4
million. During the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022, there were
no
tax impacts on net investment hedges. Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
The net change in retirement obligations in other comprehensive income includes amortization of net actuarial losses included in net periodic benefit cost. During the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022, the net change in retirement obligations in other comprehensive income before reclassifications resulted in income tax benefit of $ 1
million and income tax expense of $ 3  million, respectively. During the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022, the gains and losses on defined benefit and pension items reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of $ 8

Refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The income tax on unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022 was an expense of $ 20
million and $ 51
million, respectively. During the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022, gains and losses on cash flow hedges reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of $ 98

Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions from time to time involving product liability, employment, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations, including those described below. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. As a result, interaction with governmental agencies is ongoing. The Company’s standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company’s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions. The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. The Company classifies certain specified litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as
certain litigation charges, net
in the consolidated statements of income. The Company recognized
no
certain litigation charges during the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, respectively, whereas the Company recognized $ 35
million and $ 95
million of certain litigation charges during the three and nine months ended January 28, 2022, respectively. At January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022, accrued litigation was approximately $ 0.3  billion. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in
other accrued expenses
and
other liabilities
on the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 27 Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Intellectual Property Matters At any given time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (IP) rights, and licenses, acquisitions or other agreements relating to such rights. This litigation includes, but is not limited to, alleged infringement or misappropriation of IP rights, or breach of obligations related to IP rights, or other claims asserted by competitors, individuals, or, consistent with a growing trend across technology-intensive industries, other entities created specifically to fund IP litigation. While the outcome of these litigation matters is inherently uncertain, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require the Company to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, and negatively impact the Company's ability to sell current or future products, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Colibri
The Company is a defendant in patent litigation brought by Colibri Heart Valve LLC (Colibri) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Colibri alleges infringement of one patent by the Company’s Evolut family of transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices. The patent asserted by Colibri has expired. On February 8, 2023, a jury returned a verdict against the Company for approximately $ 106  million. The Company has strong arguments to appeal the verdict and will file post-trial motions and, if necessary, appeals with the appropriate appellate courts. The Company has not recognized an expense in connection with this matter because it does not currently believe a loss is probable. Product Liability Matters Pelvic Mesh Litigation The Company is currently involved in litigation in various state and federal courts against manufacturers of pelvic mesh products alleging personal injuries resulting from the implantation of those products.
Two
subsidiaries of Covidien supplied pelvic mesh products to
one
of the manufacturers, C.R. Bard (Bard), named in the litigation. The litigation includes a federal multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia and cases in various state courts and jurisdictions outside the U.S. Generally, complaints allege design and manufacturing claims, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraud, violations of state consumer protection laws and loss of consortium claims. In fiscal year 2016, Bard paid the Company $ 121  million towards the settlement of
11,000
of these claims.
In May 2017, the agreement with Bard was amended to extend the terms to apply to up to an additional
5,000
claims. That agreement does not resolve the dispute between the Company and Bard with respect to claims that do not settle, if any. As part of the agreement, the Company and Bard agreed to dismiss without prejudice their pending litigation with respect to Bard’s obligation to defend and indemnify the Company. The Company estimates law firms representing approximately
16,200
claimants have asserted or may assert claims involving products manufactured by Covidien’s subsidiaries.
As of February 1, 2023, the Company had reached agreements to settle approximately
15,900
of these claims. The Company's accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.
Hernia Mesh Litigation Starting in fiscal year 2020, plaintiffs began filing lawsuits against certain subsidiaries of the Company in U.S. state and federal courts that allege personal injury from hernia mesh products sold by those subsidiaries. As of February 17, 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of approximately
6,070
individual plaintiffs, and certain plaintiffs’ law firms have advised the Company that they may file additional cases in the future. Approximately
5,950
plaintiffs have filed lawsuits in a coordinated proceeding in Massachusetts state court, where they have been consolidated before a single judge. Approximately
470
plaintiffs have filed lawsuits in a coordinated action in Minnesota state court, and there are approximately
280
actions coordinated in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The pending lawsuits relate almost entirely to hernia mesh products that have not been subject to recalls, withdrawals, or other adverse regulatory action.
The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. A dditionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters. Diabetes Pump Retainer Ring Litigation Starting in fiscal year 2021, plaintiffs began filing lawsuits against the Diabetes operating unit in U.S. state and federal courts alleging personal injury from Series 600 insulin pumps with allegedly defective clear retainer rings that were subject to field corrective actions in 2019 and 2021. As of February 17, 2023,
60
individual plaintiffs have filed lawsuits, and certain plaintiffs’ law firms have notified the Company that they may file additional lawsuits in the future on behalf of thousands of additional claimants. Most of the filed suits are coordinated in California state court. The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters. 28 Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Environmental Proceedings The Company is a successor to several investigation and cleanup actions at various stages related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites, including in Orrington, Maine. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.
The Company is also a successor to a party named in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine in the early 2000’s by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Maine People’s Alliance relating to mercury contamination of the Penobscot River and Bay and options for remediating such contamination. In March 2021, the parties notified the court that they had agreed on a settlement in principle of all issues in this matter, and in September 2022 the parties filed a joint motion for final approval by the court. The court has conditionally approved the settlement and the parties are awaiting issuance of the final court order approving the settlement. The conditional court approval did not result in a change to the Company's previous accrual for this matter. The Company's accrued expenses for these various environmental proceedings are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.
Income Taxes In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) reviewed this dispute, and in June 2016, issued an opinion with respect to the allocation of income between the parties for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 whereby it generally rejected the IRS’s position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. In April 2017, the IRS filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit regarding the Tax Court opinion. Oral argument for the Appeal occurred in March 2018. The U.S. Court of Appeals issued its opinion in August 2018 and remanded the case back to the Tax Court for additional factual findings, which it concluded in June 2021. The Tax Court issued its opinion on August 18, 2022, and it remains subject to appeal by either or both parties. At this time, the Company is evaluating whether to file an appeal. The IRS has issued its audit reports on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2007 through 2016. Medtronic, Inc. and the IRS have reached agreement on all significant issues except for the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court matter for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc.’s fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS. Covidien LP (a wholly owned subsidiary of Medtronic plc) has either reached agreement with the IRS or the statute of limitations has lapsed on its U.S. federal income tax returns through fiscal year 2019. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the income tax matters discussed above, the Company believes it is possible that charges associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. Refer to Note 11 for additional discussion of income taxes. Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Company and/or its affiliates periodically enter into agreements that require one or more of the Company and/or its affiliates to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of the Company or its affiliates’ products, the negligence of the Company's personnel, or claims alleging that the Company's products infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property. The Company also offers warranties on various products. The Company’s maximum exposure under these guarantees is unable to be estimated. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of guarantees. The Company believes the ultimate resolution of the above guarantees is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 29 Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 17 .
Segment and Geographic Information Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. Net sales of the Company's reportable segments include end-customer revenues from the sale of products the segment develops, manufactures, and distributes. The Company’s management evaluates performance of the segments and allocates resources based on net sales and segment operating profit. Segment operating profit represents income before income taxes, excluding interest income or expense, amortization of intangible assets, centralized distribution costs, non-operating income or expense items, certain corporate charges, and other items not allocated to the segments.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022. Certain depreciable assets may be recorded by one segment, while the depreciation expense is allocated to another segment. The allocation of depreciation expense is based on the proportion of the assets used by each segment.
There were no changes to the reportable segments during the quarter ended January 27, 2023. The Company's
four
principal operating and reportable segments are as follows: Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit.
The following tables present reconciliations of financial information from the segments to the applicable line items in the Company's consolidated financial statements: Segment Operating Profit   Three months ended Nine months ended (in millions) January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 Cardiovascular $ 1,034   $ 1,077   $ 3,037   $ 3,333   Medical Surgical 748   923   2,104   2,746   Neuroscience 897   903   2,587   2,753   Diabetes 106   161   279   450   Segment operating profit 2,784   3,064   8,008   9,282   Interest expense, net ( 167 ) ( 137 ) ( 449 ) ( 410 ) Other non-operating income, net 149   67   342   244   Amortization of intangible assets ( 431 ) ( 432 ) ( 1,275 ) ( 1,298 ) Corporate ( 523 ) ( 483 ) ( 1,339 ) ( 1,347 ) Centralized distribution costs ( 264 ) ( 401 ) ( 886 ) ( 1,382 ) Restructuring and associated costs ( 104 ) ( 78 ) ( 275 ) ( 237 ) Acquisition-related items ( 24 ) 60   ( 61 ) 54   Certain litigation charges, net —   ( 35 ) —   ( 95 ) RCS impairments / costs ( 10 ) —   ( 109 ) —   MCS impairments / costs —   —   —   ( 726 ) IPR&D charges —   ( 11 ) —   ( 101 ) Medical device regulations ( 37 ) ( 25 ) ( 107 ) ( 70 ) Exit of business —   —   ( 37 ) —   Income before income taxes $ 1,375   $ 1,589   $ 3,813   $ 3,915   30 Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Geographic Information Net sales are attributed to the country based on the location of the customer taking possession of the products or in which the services are rendered.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Medtronic plc and its subsidiaries (Medtronic plc, Medtronic, or the Company, or we, us, or our). For a full understanding of financial condition and results of operations, you should read this discussion along with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022. In addition, you should read this discussion along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at and for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023. Amounts reported in millions within this quarterly report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.
Financial Trends
Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" and are intended to supplement, and should not be considered as superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry.
As presented in the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations section below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments).
In the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported. Because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the income tax provision, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting property, plant, and equipment additions from operating cash flows.
Refer to the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations," "Income Taxes," and "Free Cash Flow" sections for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW Medtronic is the leading global healthcare technology company — alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. Our primary products include those for cardiac rhythm disorders, cardiovascular disease, advanced and general surgical care, respiratory and monitoring solutions, renal care, neurological disorders, spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma, urological and digestive disorders, and ear, nose, and throat, and diabetes conditions.
The global healthcare system is continuing to respond to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic ("COVID-19" or the "pandemic"), including the impact on China and Japan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Several of our businesses continued to be affected by the pandemic, including the impacts of healthcare system staffing shortages on procedural volumes, and, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the COVID-19 lockdowns in China, which continued through the end of May. In addition to the impacts of the pandemic, certain businesses continue to be impacted by supply chain disruptions that began during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. We cannot predict with confidence the duration and severity of the pandemic and its impact on global procedure volumes. We expect medical procedure rates may continue to vary by therapy and country and to be impacted by regional COVID-19 case volumes, vaccine and booster immunization rates, and new COVID-19 variants. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact further healthcare system staffing shortages will have on procedural volumes, and the impact certain supply chain disruptions will have on the business. 32 The following is a summary of revenue and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022, and operating cash flow for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022: 33 GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations
Starting with the quarter ended April 29, 2022, the Company no longer adjusts non-GAAP financial measures for certain license payments for, or acquisitions of, technology not approved by regulators due to recent industry guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical non-GAAP financial measures presented in this quarterly report have been recast for comparability.

The decline in net sales for three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year, was driven primarily by unfavorable currency impact, sales in China due to volume-based procurement tenders and the impact of COVID-19 resurgence, as well as supply chain challenges in certain businesses, particularly in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. For the three months ended January 27, 2023, currency had an unfavorable impact on emerging markets and non-U.S. developed markets of $89 million and $290 million, respectively. For the nine months ended January 27, 2023, currency had an unfavorable impact on emerging markets and non-U.S. developed markets of $190 million and $995 million, respectively. The decline in net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 was partially offset by growth in certain product lines and businesses, including Micra, Transcatheter Aortic Valve replacements (TAVR), Core Spine in the U.S., and Diabetes in international markets. Looking ahead, a number of macro-economic and geopolitical factors could negatively impact our business, including without limitation:
• Competitive product launches and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic risks including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, general price inflation, rising interest rates, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, delays in product registration approvals, and replacement cycle challenges;
• National and provincial tender pricing for certain products, particularly in China; • The uncertain and uneven impact of COVID-19 on future procedural volumes, supply constraints including certain electronic components and semiconductors, healthcare staffing in certain regions, and resulting impacts on demand for our products and therapies; and • The potential impact that sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict could have on revenue and supply chain. The financial impact of the conflict in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material, and for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, the business of the Company in these countries represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets. Although the implications of this conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the ongoing conflict may increase pressure on the global economy and supply chains, resulting in increased future volatility risk for our business operations and performance. 38 Cardiovascular Cardiovascular products include pacemakers, insertable cardiac monitors, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), leads and delivery systems, electrophysiology catheters, products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure devices, products designed to reduce surgical site infections, coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems, balloons and related delivery systems, endovascular stent graft systems, heart valve replacement technologies, cardiac tissue ablation systems, and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products. Cardiovascular also includes Care Management Services and Cath Lab Managed Services (CLMS) within the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division. Cardiovascular's net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 were $2.8 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively, an increase of 1 percent and decrease of 2 percent, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. Currency had an unfavorable impact of $152 million and $467 million on net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023. The net sales increase for the three months ended January 27, 2023 was primarily due to strong performance of Micra, TAVR and Diagnostics, partially offset by unfavorable currency impact. The net sales decrease for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 was primarily driven by unfavorable currency impact and supply chain challenges in certain businesses.
The graphs below illustrate the percent of Cardiovascular net sales by division for the three months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022: Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 increased 2 percent and decreased 2 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. For the three months ended January 27, 2023 the net sales increase was driven by continued adoption of Micra AV, TYRX antibacterial envelopes, LINQ II implants, and growth from Arctic Front cryoablation catheters in the U.S. The net sales declines for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 were driven by unfavorable currency partially offset by increases from continued adoption of Micra AV, TYRX antibacterial envelopes, and LINQ II implants. Additionally, Cardiac Ablation Solutions net sales for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 were negatively impacted by competitive pressures in Western Europe, as well as the pending volume-based procurement (VBP) in China.
Structural Heart & Aortic (SHA) net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 increased 3 percent and decreased 1 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 were driven by growth in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), including the U.S. launch of Evolut FX TAVR system. Net sales for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 were negatively impacted by a field corrective action with the Harmony Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve and Delivery Catheter System, currency impacts, staffing shortages, and supply shortages of contrast.
Coronary & Peripheral Vascular (CPV) net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 decreased 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The net sales declines were driven by unfavorable currency, partially offset by strong demand combined with improved product availability of the SpiderFX embolic protection device (EPD) and strong
39 performance of our superficial venous product portfolio, including the VenaSeal system. Net sales for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 were also impacted by market procedural volumes in Coronary remaining below pre-COVID levels in several major markets, headwinds related to U.S. hospital contrast shortages early in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, and declines in Peripheral Vascular Health due to competitors re-entering the market and supply chain challenges. In addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead, we expect Cardiovascular could be affected by the following: • Continued growth of our Micra transcatheter pacing system. Micra AV launched in Japan in November 2021 and China in August 2022. Micra AV expands the Micra target population from 15 percent to 45 percent of pacemaker patients. • Continued acceptance and growth from the Azure XT and S SureScan pacing systems and the 3830 lead. Azure pacemakers feature Medtronic-exclusive BlueSync technology, which enables automatic, secure wireless remote monitoring with increased device longevity. The 3830 lead, previously labeled for His-bundle pacing, has now been expanded to include left bundle branch area pacing.
• Growth of the Cobalt and Crome portfolio of ICDs and CRT-Ds.
• Growth of the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system. • Continued growth, adoption, and utilization of the TYRX Envelope for implantable devices.
• Continued acceptance and expansion of the LINQ II cardiac monitor. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we launched two AccuRhythm AI algorithms on the LINQ II platform to significantly reduce false positive alerts for Atrial Fibrillation and pause episodes while retaining sensitivity for true positive detection and reduce clinic workload and burden. AccuRhythm AI launched in Europe during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. • Continued growth of Arctic Front cryoablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation. • Continued acceptance and growth of the self-expanding CoreValve Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement platform. This includes Evolut PRO which provides enhanced hemodynamics, reliable delivery, enhanced durability, advanced sealing, and Evolut FX, a system designed to improve the overall procedural experience through enhancements in deliverability, implant visibility, and deployment stability. • Continued expansion and training of field support to increase coverage in the U.S. centers performing TAVR procedures. • Continued acceptance and growth of the Onyx Frontier DES platform. The platform launched in the U.S. in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and in select international countries in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Onyx Frontier is a drug-eluding stent (DES) that introduces an enhanced delivery system and is used for complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). • Continued acceptance and growth from the VenaSeal Closure System in the U.S. The VenaSeal Closure System is a unique non-thermal solution to address superficial venous disease that provides improved patient comfort, reduces the recovery time, and eliminates the risk of thermal nerve injury. • Acceptance and growth of IN.PACT 018 drug-coated balloons (DCB). The product was launched under limited market release in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 with full market release in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. IN.PACT 018 is used in endovascular therapies to treat femoropopliteal disease. • Pressure from competitors re-entering the market contributing to the decline in sales of the Abre venous self-expanding stent system. Abre is designed for the unique challenges of venous disease. It offers easy deployment and delivers demonstrated endurance, to give patients freedom of movement.
• Strengthening our position in the cardiac ablation technologies market as a result of the August 2022 acquisition of Affera, Inc. The acquisition expands the Cardiovascular segment portfolio of advanced cardiac ablation products and accessories to include its first cardiac mapping and navigation platform to meet physician needs within a growing patient population.
• Our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize the products within our pipeline, which include, but not limited to, the Symplicity Spyral Multi-Electrode Renal Denervation Catheter, Pulse Field Ablation, a novel energy source that is non-thermal and Aurora Extravascular ICD. 40 Medical Surgical
Medical Surgical’s products span the entire continuum of patient care from diagnosis to recovery, with a focus on diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, pelvic region, kidneys, obesity, and preventable complications. The products include those for advanced and general surgical products, surgical stapling devices, vessel sealing instruments, wound closure, electrosurgery products, hernia mechanical devices, mesh implants, advanced ablation, interventional lung, ventilators, airway products, renal care products, and sensors and monitors for pulse oximetry, capnography, level of consciousness and cerebral oximetry. Medical Surgical's net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 were $2.1 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, a decrease of 7 percent and 10 percent, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. Currency had an unfavorable impact of $117 million and $380 million on net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, respectively. The net sales decrease for both periods was primarily driven by unfavorable currency impact, provincial volume-based procurement (VBP) stapling tenders in China, and a decline in ventilator sales due to the high COVID-19 demand in the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. Supply chain disruptions, particularly in Surgical Innovations, also contributed to the net sales decrease for the nine months ended January 27, 2023. The graphs below illustrate the percent of Medical Surgical net sales by division for the three months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022: Surgical Innovations (SI) net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 decreased 6 percent and 9 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The decrease for the three months ended January 27, 2023 was predominantly attributable to declines in Advanced Stapling primarily driven by provincial VBP stapling tenders in China. The decrease for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 was led by Advanced Surgical Instruments, driven by global supply chain challenges, including resins, semiconductors, and packaging trays, which impacted energy and stapling products, and provincial VBP stapling tenders and COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Global product availability has improved during the most recent quarter. Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, & Renal (RGR) net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 decreased 8 percent and 13 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The decrease for three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 was largely due to declines in ventilator demand when compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year as demand dropped below pre-pandemic levels, as well as declines in RCS driven by product availability challenges. These declines were partially offset by growth in Gastrointestinal driven by strength in sales of GI Genius. In addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Medical Surgical could be affected by the following: • The pending separation of the combined Patient Monitoring and Respiratory Interventions businesses from the Medical Surgical Portfolio. The Company announced its intention to pursue a separation in October 2022 and expects to complete the separation 12 to 18 months from the announcement date. 41 • The pending contribution of our Renal Care Solutions business as a result of the May 25, 2022 definitive agreement with DaVita Inc. • Acceptance and continued growth of Open-to-MIS (minimally invasive surgery) techniques and tools through our efforts to transition open surgery to MIS. Open-to-MIS initiative focuses on capturing the market opportunity that exists in transitioning open procedures to MIS, whether through traditional MIS, advanced instrumentation, or robotics. Through our approach, in parallel, we also expand our presence and optimize open surgery in current open surgery markets. • Continued global acceptance and future growth of powered stapling and energy platform. • Our ability to execute ongoing strategies addressing the competitive pressure of reprocessing vessel sealing disposables and growth of our surgical soft tissue robotics procedures in the U.S. • Our ability to create markets and drive products and procedures into emerging markets with our high quality and cost-effective surgical products designed for customers in emerging markets. An example is our ValleyLab LS10 single channel vessel sealing generator, which is compatible with our line of LigaSure instruments and designed for simplified use and affordability. • Acceptance of less invasive standards of care in gastrointestinal and hepatology products, including products that span the care continuum from diagnostics to therapeutics. Recently launched products include GI Genius and PillCam capsule endoscopy. • Expanding the use of less invasive treatments and furthering our commitment to improving options for women with abnormal uterine bleeding. Our expanded and strengthened surgical offerings complement our global gynecology business. • Global adoption of robotic-assisted surgery and installations of Hugo robotic assisted surgery (RAS) system for urologic, bariatric, gynecologic, and general surgery procedures. This includes continued integration and adoption of Touch Surgery Enterprise with the first artificial intelligence powered surgical videos and analytics platform to make it easier to train and discover new techniques within the robotics platform. The Hugo RAS system, which received CE Mark in October 2021, as well as secured additional regulatory approvals outside the U.S., is designed to help reduce unwanted variability, improve patient outcomes, and, by extension, lower per procedure cost. • Our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize the products within our pipeline, which include, but are not limited to, our Hugo RAS system in the U.S., Signia power stapling devices, and our Ligasure and Sonicision vessel sealing devices. Neuroscience Neuroscience's products include various spinal implants, bone graft substitutes, biologic products, image-guided surgery and intra-operative imaging systems, robotic guidance systems used in robot-assisted spine procedures, and systems that incorporate advanced energy surgical instruments. Neuroscience's products also focus on the treatment of overactive bladder, urinary retention, fecal incontinence, as well as products to treat ear, nose, and throat (ENT), and therapies to treat the diseases of the vasculature in and around the brain, including coils, neurovascular stents and flow diversion products. Neuroscience also manufactures products related to implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders, and epilepsy. Neuroscience’s net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 were $2.2 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, an increase of 5 percent and 1 percent, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. Currency had an unfavorable impact of $78 million and $227 million on net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, respectively. The net sales increase for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, was primarily due to growth in U.S. Core Spine, Neurovascular, ENT, and continued supply risk mitigation, partially offset by unfavorable currency impact and supply chain challenges in certain businesses.
42 The graphs below illustrate the percent of Neuroscience net sales by division for the three months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022: Cranial and Spinal Technologies (CST) net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 increased 2 percent and decreased 1 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. For the three months ended January 27, 2023, the growth was driven by increased sales of Core Spine products in the U.S. including the Aible ecosystem of spine products, with a partial offset due to supply constraints within Biologics. The net sales increase was also attributable to strong sales of StealthStation Navigation and Midas Rex powered surgical instruments. For the nine months ended January 27, 2023, the net sales decrease was driven by unfavorable currency impact and Biologics, which experienced supply chain challenges. Specialty Therapies (Specialty) net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 increased 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase for both periods was driven by growth in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, flow diversion and access delivery products. The net sales increase was also driven by benefits from the recent May 2022 acquisition of Intersect ENT. For the nine months ended January 27, 2023, the growth in ENT was partially offset by supply chain disruption in disposables.
Neuromodulation (NM) net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 increased 3 percent and decreased 3 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. For the three months ended January 27, 2023, the net sales increase was driven by growth within Pain Stim and, to a lesser extent, Targeted Drug Delivery. For the nine months ended January 27, 2023, declines were largely due to declines of Brain Modulation replacement devices and supply chain challenges in Interventional which has recently seen improvements in product availability. In addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Neuroscience could be affected by the following: • Continued adoption and growth of our integrated solutions through the Aible offering, which integrates spinal implants with enabling technologies (StealthStation, O-arm Imaging Systems, and Midas), Mazor robotics, and AI-driven technology acquired from Medicrea for surgical planning and personalized spinal implants.
• Market acceptance and continued global adoption of innovative new spine products and procedural solutions within our CST operating unit, such as our Infinity OCT System and Prestige LP cervical disc system, as well as continued growth from spine titanium interbody implants. • Continued acceptance and growth of our ENT and Pelvic Health therapies, including our InterStim therapy with InterStim X, InterStim II, and InterStim Micro and neurostimulators for the treatment of the symptoms of overactive bladder, urinary retention, and bowel incontinence, and capital equipment sales of the Stealth Station ENT surgical navigation system and intraoperative NIM nerve monitoring system.
43 • Strengthening our position in the ENT market as a result of the May 2022 acquisition of Intersect ENT, a global ENT medical technology leader. The acquisition expands Neuroscience's portfolio of products used during ENT procedures and combined with the Company's navigation, powered instruments, and existing tissue health products, offers a broader suite of solutions to assist surgeons treating patients who suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). • Continued acceptance and growth of the Solitaire FR revascularization device for treatment of acute ischemic stroke and our React Catheter and Riptide aspiration system.
• Continued growth of Pipeline Embolization Devices, endovascular treatments for large or giant wide-necked brain aneurysms.
• Market acceptance and continued global adoption of our Intellis spinal cord stimulator and DTM proprietary waveform to treat chronic pain in major markets around the world. • Continued acceptance and growth of our Percept PC DBS device with BrainSense technology, including its treatment of Parkinson's Disease, epilepsy, and other movement disorders. • Market acceptance and growth from SCS therapy for treating Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) on Intellis rechargeable neurostimulator and Vanta recharge-free neurostimulator which received U.S. FDA approval in January 2022. • Ongoing obligations under the U.S. FDA consent decree entered in April 2015 relating to the SynchroMed drug infusion system and the Neuromodulation quality system. The U.S. FDA lifted its distribution requirements on our implantable drug pump in October 2017 and its warning letter in November 2017. • Our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize the products within our pipeline, which include our closed-loop Percept RC device with adaptive DBS (aDBS) and Inceptiv Neurostimulator, as well as our hemorrhagic stroke intravascular device, and our next-generation spine enabling technologies. Diabetes Diabetes' products include insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, consumables, and smart insulin pen systems. Diabetes' net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 were $570 million and $1.7 billion, a decrease of 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. Currency had an unfavorable impact of $33 million and $113 million on net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, respectively. The decrease in net sales for both periods was primarily driven by unfavorable currency impacts and declines in the U.S. The net sales declines were partially offset by strong international growth primarily driven by the continued international expansion of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump system and integrated CGM.
In addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Diabetes could be affected by the following: • Continued patient demand for the MiniMed 770G insulin pump system, which is powered by SmartGuard technology and features the added benefits of smartphone connectivity and an expanded age indication to children as young as age two. • Continued acceptance and growth internationally for the MiniMed 780G insulin pump system. The global adoption of sensor-augmented insulin pump systems has resulted in strong sensor attachment rates. • Continued acceptance and growth of the Guardian Connect CGM system, which displays glucose information directly to a smartphone to help ensure patients have access to their glucose levels seamlessly and discretely. The Guardian Connect CGM system is available on both Apple iOS and Android devices.
• Market acceptance and growth of our InPen smart pen system, which allows users to have their Medtronic CGM readings in real-time alongside insulin dose information, all in one view.
• Continued pump, CGM, and consumable competition in an expanding global market.
• Changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs, along with additional payor coverage on insulin pumps. • Resolution of findings contained in a December 2021 U.S. FDA warning letter relating to the MiniMed 600 series insulin pump and a remote controller device for MiniMed 508 and Paradigm pumps. We are currently working with the U.S. FDA to resolve the findings. The existence of the warning letter may limit our ability to launch certain new Diabetes products in the U.S. prior to resolution of the findings. 44 • Our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize the products within our pipeline, which include, but are not limited to, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, the Guardian 4 sensor, and our next-generation sensor Simplera, which have been submitted to the U.S. FDA.
COSTS AND EXPENSES The following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022: Cost of Products Sold
We continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management, manufacturing improvements, and optimizing our manufacturing network. Cost of products sold for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 was $2.7 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, as compared to $2.5 billion and $7.6 billion for the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased labor and direct material manufacturing costs, predominantly due to inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges as well as increased freight due to higher fuel costs and expedited shipments for backorders resulting from supply chain challenges. The nine months ended January 28, 2022 included $58 million of inventory write-downs associated with our June 2021 decision to stop the distribution and sale of Medtronic's HVAD System (MCS charges). Looking forward, our cost of products sold likely will be further negatively impacted by inflation, supply chain challenges, and higher labor and direct material costs. Research and Development Expense
We remain committed to deliver the best possible experiences for patients, physicians, and caregivers we serve; to create technologies that expand what’s possible across the entire human body to transform lives; to turn data and insights into real action to serve patient needs to improve care; and to expand healthcare access and deliver positive outcomes. Research and development expense for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 was $688 million and $2.1 billion, respectively, as compared to $668 million and $2.1 billion for the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The nine months ended January 28, 2022 included $101 million of acquisitions of, and license payments for, technology not yet approved by regulators, primarily in our Diabetes segment. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense
Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages, other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses, and certain acquisition and restructuring expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 was $2.6 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively as compared to $2.6 billion and $7.7 billion for the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by increased sales incentives, employee travel as compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year when travel was limited, and to a lesser extent by net sales declines. 45 The following is a summary of other costs and expenses (income): Three months ended Nine months ended (in millions) January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 Amortization of intangible assets $ 431  $ 432  $ 1,275  $ 1,298  Restructuring charges, net 38  12  81  32  Certain litigation charges, net —  35  —  95  Other operating (income) expense, net (125) (63) (187) 719  Other non-operating income, net (149) (67) (342) (244) Interest expense, net 167  137  449  410  Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense of our definite-lived intangible assets, consisting of purchased patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and other intangible assets.
Restructuring Charges, Net
For the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 and January 28, 2022, restructuring costs primarily related to Enterprise Excellence and Simplification restructuring programs, both of which the Company expects to be substantially completed by the end of this fiscal year. Further program details are described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022. In total, the Company expects it will recognize charges of approximately $1.8 billion for Enterprise Excellence and approximately $450 million for Simplification. Charges recognized within restructuring charges, net primarily comprise of employee termination benefits for the referenced programs. For additional information about our restructuring programs, refer to Note 5 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. Certain Litigation Charges, Net
We classify specified certain litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as
certain litigation charges, net
in the consolidated statements of income. For additional information, refer to Note 16 in the current period's consolidated financial statements.
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net
Other operating (income) expense, net primarily includes royalty income and expense, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, MCS charges, RCS charges, impairment charges, and income from funded research and development arrangements.
For the three months ended January 27, 2023, the change in other operating (income) expense, net was primarily driven by the net currency impact of remeasurement expense and our hedging programs, which resulted in a net gain of $134 million as compared to a net gain of $42 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. The three months ended January 28, 2022 also included $81 million of income related to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. For the nine months ended January 27, 2023, the change in other operating (income) expense, net was primarily driven by MCS charges recorded during nine months ended January 28, 2022. The charges of $668 million primarily included $409 million of intangible asset impairments and $211 million for commitments and obligations, including customer support obligations, restructuring, and other associated costs. Additionally, the change was driven by the net currency impact of remeasurement expense and our hedging programs, which resulted in a net gain of $353 million combined for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 as compared to a net gain of $6 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. During the nine months ended January 27, 2023, the Company also recorded non-cash pre-tax charges of $81 million, primarily related to impairment of goodwill, as a result of the anticipated sale of half of the Company's RCS business, related to the May 25, 2022 agreement with DaVita Inc. Other Non-Operating Income, Net
Other non-operating income, net includes the non-service component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income. For the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, the increase in other non-operating income, net is primarily attributable to an increase in interest income, partially offset by reduced gains on our equity method and minority investment portfolios. Interest income was $118 million and $246 million for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, respectively, and $45 million and $134 million for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2022, respectively. Gains on equity method and minority investments were $7 million and $22 million for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, respectively, compared to a loss of $3 million and gain of $36 million for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2022, respectively. 46 Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net includes interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts, amortization of amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of certain net investment hedges, and charges recognized in connection with the early redemption of senior notes. For the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023, the increase in interest expense, net was primarily due to the Company's outstanding commercial paper balance and the issuance of four tranches of Euro-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of €3.5 billion in September 2022. Additionally, for the nine months ended January 27, 2023, the increase is due to the $53 million charge incurred as a result of the early redemption of approximately $2.3 billion of senior notes, during the three months ended July 29, 2022. Partially offsetting the increase for the three and nine months was $26 million and $74 million, respectively, in after-tax unrealized gains representing amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of certain net investment hedges. INCOME TAXES Three months ended Nine months ended (in millions) January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 Income tax provision $ 146  $ 106  $ 1,218  $ 346  Income before income taxes 1,375  1,589  3,813  3,915  Effective tax rate 10.6  % 6.7  % 31.9  % 8.8  % Non-GAAP income tax provision $ 239  $ 260  $ 736  $ 782  Non-GAAP income before income taxes 1,973  2,101  5,706  6,264  Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate 12.1  % 12.4  % 12.9  % 12.5  % Difference between the effective tax rate and Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate 1.5  % 5.7  % (19.0) % 3.7  % On August 18, 2022, the U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) issued its opinion on the previously disclosed litigation regarding the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 (Opinion). While the Opinion rejected the IRS’s position and the Tax Court determined the methodology advanced by Medtronic was appropriate for purposes of determining the intercompany royalty rate between Puerto Rico and the U.S., it determined that the royalty rate should be higher, thereby increasing income allocated to the U.S. and consequently subject to U.S. tax. This case relates only to fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Opinion remains subject to finalization by the Tax Court and to appeal by either or both parties. We have assumed the Tax Court findings will be applied for all years following fiscal year 2006. As a result, the Company recorded a $764 million net tax charge during the three months ended October 28, 2022 to recognize the estimated tax impact of the Tax Court Opinion. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 was 10.6% and 31.9%, respectively, as compared to 6.7% and 8.8% for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2022, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended January 27, 2023, as compared to the three months ended January 28, 2022, primarily relates to the deferred tax impact associated with a step up in tax basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes recorded during the three months ended January 28, 2022. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended January 27, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended January 28, 2022, primarily relates to the $764 million net tax charge referenced above, and the deferred tax impact associated with a step up in tax basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes recorded during the prior fiscal year.
Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 was 12.1% and 12.9%, as compared to 12.4% and 12.5% for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2022, respectively. The change in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate was primarily due to year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction, and the year-over-year decrease in stock based compensation benefits, which were offset by the benefits from the finalization of certain income tax returns and statute of limitation lapses. An increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for the three and nine months ended January 27, 2023 of approximately $20 million and $57 million, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We are currently in a strong financial position, and we believe our balance sheet and liquidity as of January 27, 2023 provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, along with our credit facility and related commercial paper programs will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs. 47 Our liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning processes. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, property, plant, and equipment, and other operating costs. We also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, satisfying maturing debt, and acquiring businesses and technology. Summary of Cash Flows The following is a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, and the net change in cash and cash equivalents:   Nine months ended (in millions) January 27, 2023 January 28, 2022 Cash provided by (used in):     Operating activities $ 3,579  $ 5,289  Investing activities (3,018) (1,930) Financing activities (70) (3,387) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 317  (87) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 808  $ (114) Operating Activities
The $1.7 billion decrease in net cash provided was primarily driven by a decrease in cash collected from customers, an increase in cash paid for income taxes and an increase in spend on inventory. The decrease in net cash was partially offset by a decrease in cash paid to employees. The decrease in cash collected from customers was primarily related to timing of sales, slower collections and supply chain challenges, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cash paid for income taxes in the nine months ended January 27, 2023, was due to estimated income tax payments including a cash deposit associated with the Tax Court Opinion, and the increase in spend for inventory was due to inflationary impacts to direct labor and material costs. Cash paid to employees decreased due to lower annual incentive plan payouts for prior year performance compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. For more information about the tax cash deposit paid, refer to Note 11 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. Investing Activities
The $1.1 billion increase in cash used was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $1.8 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of investments of $704 million, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. For more information on the aforementioned acquisitions, refer to Note 4
to the current's period's consolidated financial statements.
Financing Activities
There was a $3.3 billion decrease in net cash used during the nine months ended January 27, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company issued four tranches of Euro-denominated Senior Notes of approximately $3.4 billion. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity €750 million of Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $772 million of total consideration in December 2022. Additionally, the Company had $625 million of commercial paper that was issued and outstanding at the end of the current period. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company issued short-term borrowings of approximately $2.3 billion under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement and used the proceeds to fund the early redemption of senior notes for total consideration of $2.3 billion. For more information on the issuance and payment of the senior notes, commercial paper, and Term Loan and redemption of senior notes, refer to the Debt and Capital section. Debt and Capital
Our capital structure consists of equity and interest-bearing debt. We primarily utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our financing needs and, to a lesser extent, bank borrowings. From time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Total debt at January 27, 2023 was $28.1 billion as compared to $24.1 billion at April 29, 2022. The increase in total debt was driven by issuance of Euro-denominated Senior Notes of $3.4 billion and commercial paper outstanding of $625 million, offset by fluctuations in exchange rates and repayment of Euro-denominated Senior Notes of $772 million. In May 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement (Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement) with Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for an aggregate principal amount of up to ¥300 billion with a term of 364 days. In May and June 2022, Medtronic Luxco borrowed an aggregate of ¥297 billion, or approximately $2.3 billion, of the term loan, under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement. The Company used the net proceeds of the borrowings to fund the early redemption of $1.9 billion of Medtronic Inc. Senior Notes for $1.9 billion of total consideration, and $368 million of Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $376 million of total consideration. The Company recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million in the quarter ended July 29, 2022, which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss was recognized in
interest expense, net
in the consolidated statements of income.
48 In September 2022, we issued four tranches of Euro-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of €3.5 billion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2026 to 2035, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately €3.5 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity €750 million of 0.000% Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $772 million of total consideration in December 2022. The Company intends to use the remaining proceeds to repay at maturity €1.5 billion of 0.375% Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes and €1.25 billion of 0.000% Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes in March 2023.
We repurchase our ordinary shares on occasion as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $6.0 billion of the Company's ordinary shares. There is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations. During the nine months ended January 27, 2023, the Company repurchased a total of 5 million shares under this program at an average price of $93.24. At January 27, 2023, we had approximately $2.5 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors.
For more information on credit arrangements, refer to Note 7 to the current period's consolidated financial statements and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022. Liquidity Our liquidity sources at January 27, 2023 included $4.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $6.6 billion of current investments. Additionally, we maintain commercial paper programs and a Credit Facility.
Our investments primarily include available-for-sale debt securities, including U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposits, and other asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 6 to the current period's consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. We maintain multicurrency commercial paper programs for short-term financing, which allow us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.5 billion. At January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022, we had $625 million and no commercial paper outstanding, respectively. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit, as explained below. We also have a $3.5 billion five-year syndicated credit facility (Credit Facility), which expires in December 2027. At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility we can request a one-year extension of the maturity date. The Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper programs and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional $1.0 billion at any time during the term of the agreement. At January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility. Interest rates on advances of our Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our long-term debt ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s). Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. We are in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Facility. The following table is a summary of our S&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings: Agency Rating (1) January 27, 2023 April 29, 2022 Standard & Poor's Ratings Services    Long-term debt A A    Short-term debt A-1 A-1 Moody's Investors Service    Long-term debt A3 A3    Short-term debt P-2 P-2 (1)
Agency ratings are subject to change, and there may be no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings and/or maintain its current ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. S&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at January 27, 2023 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at April 29, 2022. We do not expect the S&P and Moody's ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet, Credit Facility, and related commercial paper programs. 49 We have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business. We believe our off-balance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. Refer to the Debt and Capital section above for changes in debt obligations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023; there have been no other material changes to our long-term contractual obligations as reported in our most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022. ACQUISITIONS Information regarding acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. GOODWILL We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. There were no impairments of goodwill in the current period as a result of the annual impairment test. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. Refer to our Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net section for further details on impairment charges in the current fiscal year. Further adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions or significant changes to our current and future expected financial performance could lead to goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods, and such charges could be material to our results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
As of January 27, 2023, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates.

We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. One must carefully consider forward-looking statements and understand that such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, and involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed in the sections entitled “Government Regulation” within “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those related to: • competition in the medical device industry; • delays in regulatory approvals; • the global COVID-19 pandemic, including new COVID-19 variants that may emerge, as well as impacts of the pandemic on healthcare staffing levels;
• reduction or interruption in our supply; • failure to complete or achieve the intended benefits of acquisitions or divestitures; • adverse regulatory action; • laws and governmental regulations; • litigation results; • quality problems; • healthcare policy changes; • cybersecurity incidents; 52 • international operations, including the impact of armed conflicts; • self-insurance; • commercial insurance; • changes in applicable tax rates; • positions taken by taxing authorities; • decreasing selling prices and pricing pressure; • liquidity shortfalls; • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • inflation; or • disruption of our current plans and operations. Consequently, no forward-looking statement may be guaranteed, and actual results may vary materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We intend to take advantage of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding our forward-looking statements and are including this sentence for the express purpose of enabling us to use the protections of the safe harbor with respect to all forward-looking statements. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK Due to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes, which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at January 27, 2023 and April 29, 2022 was $19.6 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively. At January 27, 2023, these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of $58 million. Additional information regarding our currency exchange rate derivative instruments is included in Note 8 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at January 27, 2023 indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, it would have the following impact on the fair value of these contracts: Increase (decrease) (in millions) January 27, 2023 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar $ 1,384  10% depreciation in the U.S. dollar (1,384) Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.
INTEREST RATE RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our short-term investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at January 27, 2023 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and Yen, of which substantially all is fixed rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates, as compared to interest rates at January 27, 2023, would have the following impact on the fair value of these instruments: Increase (decrease) (in millions) January 27, 2023 10 basis point increase in interest rates $ 66  10 basis point decrease in interest rates (66) 53 For a discussion of current market conditions and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, please see the “Liquidity” section of the current period's Management's Discussion and Analysis. For additional discussion of market risk, refer to Notes 6 and 8 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. Item 4. Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In accordance with Item 103 of Regulation S-K, we have adopted a $1 million disclosure threshold for proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, as we believe matters under this threshold are not material to the Company. A discussion of the Company’s legal proceedings and other loss contingencies are described in Note 16 to the current period's consolidated financial statements. Item 2.

There is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations. Item 5. Other Information Medtronic has engaged in certain activities that it is required to disclose pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(ii) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In particular, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, Medtronic engaged in certain regulatory activities involving Russia’s Federal Security Service (“FSB”) related to its medical devices that were expressly authorized by the U.S. Government under applicable economic sanctions regulations. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 ending January 27, 2023, in the normal course of business and consistent with Office of Foreign Assets Control authorizations as in effect at the time, Medtronic Russia filed on e notification
with the FSB, as required under local Russian law for the import of medical devices that make use of encryption functionality. This activity did not directly result in any revenues or profits for Medtronic. To the extent that notifications with the FSB remain permissible under U.S. law, Medtronic may decide to continue engaging in such activities for the limited purposes of complying with local law requirements in Russia. 54 Item 6.
