DAYBREAK OIL AND GAS, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 —
ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION :
Organization
Originally incorporated as Daybreak Uranium, Inc.,
(“Daybreak Uranium”) on March 11, 1955, under the laws of the State of Washington, Daybreak Uranium was organized to explore
for, acquire, and develop mineral properties in the Western United States. In August 1955, the assets of Morning Sun Uranium, Inc. were
acquired by Daybreak Uranium. In May 1964, Daybreak Uranium changed its name to Daybreak Mines, Inc. During 2005, management of the Company
decided to enter the crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production industry. On October 25, 2005, the Company shareholders
approved a name change from Daybreak Mines, Inc. to Daybreak Oil and Gas, Inc. (referred to herein as “Daybreak” or the “Company”)
to better reflect the business of the Company.
All of the Company’s crude oil production is
sold under contracts which are market-sensitive. Accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and capital
resources are highly dependent upon prevailing market prices of, and demand for, crude oil. These commodity prices are subject to wide
fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the Company. These factors may include
the level of global demand for petroleum (hydrocarbon) products; foreign supply of crude oil and natural gas; the establishment of and
compliance with production quotas by crude oil-exporting countries; the relative strength of the U.S. dollar; weather conditions; the
price and availability of alternative fuels; overall economic conditions, both foreign and domestic; crude oil price disputes between
OPEC and non-OPEC members; and national and international pandemics like the coronavirus outbreak.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements
and notes for the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q for quarterly reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures
normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included and such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
Operating results for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
fiscal year ending February 28, 2023.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended February 28, 2022.
Use of Estimates
In preparing financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ materially from those estimates. The accounting policies most affected by management’s estimates and assumptions are
as follows:
· The reliance on estimates of
proved reserves to compute the provision for depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) and to determine the amount
of any impairment of proved properties;
· The valuation of unproved acreage
and proved crude oil properties to determine the amount of any impairment of crude oil properties;
· Judgment regarding the productive
status of in-progress exploratory wells to determine the amount of any provision for abandonment; and
· Estimates regarding abandonment
obligations; and
· Estimates regarding projected
cash flows used in determining the production payable discount.
7
Earnings per Share
The Company follows ASC Topic 260,
Earnings per
Share , to account for the earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common
share calculations are determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share
equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation.
NOTE 2 —
GOING CONCERN :
Financial Condition
The Company’s financial statements for the nine
months ended November 30, 2022 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net operating losses since entering the crude oil exploration
industry and as of November 30, 2022 has an accumulated deficit of $ 31.2
million and a working capital deficit of $ 1.85
million which
raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management Plans to Continue as a Going Concern
The Company continues to implement plans to enhance
its ability to continue as a going concern. Daybreak currently has a net revenue interest (“NRI”) in
20
producing crude oil
wells in its East Slopes Project located in Kern County, California (the “East Slopes Project”). The revenue from these wells
has created a steady and reliable source of income for the Company. The Company’s average working interest (“WI”) in
these wells is
36.6 % and the average net revenue interest (“NRI”) is
27.6 % for these same wells.
Revenue
In May 2022, the Company acquired Reabold California,
LLC (“Reabold”) from a third party. This property currently includes
four
producing wells,
five
shut-in wells, and
two
potential
disposal wells in the Monterey and Contra Costa counties of California. We have a
50 % working interest with a
40 % net revenue interest
in this project.
In conjunction with our acquisition of Reabold, the
Company was able to secure a capital raise of $ 2,500,000
through the issuances of the Company’s common stock.
The Company anticipates its revenue will continue
to increase as the Company participates in the drilling of more wells in the East Slopes and the Reabold Projects in California. Daybreak’s
sources of funds in the past have included the debt or equity markets and the sale of assets. It will be necessary for the Company to
obtain additional funding from the private or public debt or equity markets in the future. However, the Company cannot offer any assurance
that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.
Daybreak’s financial statements as of November
30, 2022 do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute the Company’s plans to improve
its ability to continue as a going concern.
NOTE
3
—
CONCENTRATION RISK :
Substantially all of the Company’s trade accounts
receivable consists of receivables from two sources: (1) the sale of crude oil and natural gas production from operations by the Company
and (2) from receivables from the Company’s working interest partners in the East Slopes project where we are the Operator or from
the Reabold project where we have one working interest partner. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact the
Company’s overall credit risk, as these entities could be affected by similar changes in economic conditions including lower crude
oil prices as well as other related factors. Trade accounts receivable are generally not collateralized.
Customer Concentration
At the Company’s East Slopes and Reabold projects
in California, there is only one buyer for the purchase of crude oil production and one buyer for the natural gas production in the Reabold
project. The Company has no natural gas production in the East Slopes project. At November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 these customers
represented
100.0 % of crude oil and natural gas sales receivable. If these buyers are unable to resell their products or if they lose
a significant sales contract, the Company may incur difficulties in selling its crude oil and natural gas production.
8
Crude oil and natural gas sales receivables balances
of $ 178,679
and $ 117,727
at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, represent crude oil and natural gas sales that occurred in November
and February 2022, respectively.
Joint interest participant receivables balances of
$ 404,085
and $ 85,339
at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively, represent amounts due from our working interest partners
in both the East Slopes and Reabold projects. There were no allowances for doubtful accounts for the Company’s trade accounts receivable
at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, as the joint interest owners have a history of paying their obligations.

On May 25, 2022, the Company finalized the acquisition
of Reabold California, LLC (“Reabold”). This property includes producing wells in both the Monterey and Contra Costa counties
of California. This project includes
four
producing wells,
five
shut-in wells and the potential for
two
disposal wells. The Company has
a
50 % working interest with a
40 % net revenue interest in this project. The balances above include the Reabold acquisition.
NOTE 5 –
ACQUISITION :
On May 25, 2022, the Company finalized the acquisition
of Reabold from a third party for
160,964,489
shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $ 6,599,544 . The transaction balance
of $ 6,863,163
reflects the common stock valuation of the acquisition transaction and $ 263,619
in reimbursements to the seller as a purchase
price adjustment relating to expenditures for workovers agreed to by the Company and the third party. The following table presents the
estimated allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisition.

Accounts payable
( 263,619 )

Purchase price, net of closing adjustments
$ 6,599,544
This preliminary allocation is based on
management’s estimated fair value of the Reabold assets and liabilities at May 25, 2022, and is subject to adjustment when a
third party valuation to determine the fair value of the assets for ASC 805, Business Combinations reporting purposes is received.
Adjustments made to the Reabold assets are derived from a total value of $ 6,599,544 ,
based on
160,964,489
shares of stock issued for the acquisition and the closing price that day of $ 0.041
per share. From the $ 6,599,544
amount, total assets acquired of $ 4,694,563
was deducted, and liabilities acquired of $ 263,619,
and liabilities paid of $ 292,336
were added back to arrive at the $ 1,876,264
amount of Goodwill recorded at November 30, 2022. The Company incurred approximately $ 445,529
in transaction costs directly related to the Acquisition.
NOTE 6 —
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE :
On March 1, 2009, the Company became the operator
for its East Slopes Project located in Kern County, California. Additionally, the Company then assumed certain original defaulting partners’
approximate $ 1.5
million liability
representing a 25% working interest in the drilling and completion costs associated with the East Slopes
Project four earning well program. The Company subsequently sold the same 25% working interest on June 11, 2009 .
9
Of
the $ 1.5
million liability, $ 244,849
remains unpaid and is included in both the November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 accounts payable
balances. Payment of this liability has been delayed until the Company’s cash flow situation improves. On October 17, 2018, a working
interest partner in California filed a UCC financing statement in regards to payables owed to the partner by the Company. At November
30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the balance owed this working interest partner was $ 65,381
and $ 76,268 , respectively, and is included
in the approximate $ 2.5
million and
1.65
million accounts payable balance at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively.
NOTE 7
—
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE-
RELATED PARTIES :
The November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 accounts
payable – related party balances of approximately $ 22,164
and $ 49,228
respectively, were comprised primarily of expense reimbursements
to employees.
In California at the East Slopes Project, two of the
vendors that the Company uses for services are partially owned by a related party, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. The Company’s
Chief Operating Officer is 50% owner in both Great Earth Power and ABPlus Net Holdings. Great Earth Power began providing a portion of
the solar power electrical service for production operations in July 2020. ABPlus Net Holdings began providing portable tank rentals to
the Company as a part of its water treatment and disposal operations in September 2020. The services provided by Great Earth Power and
ABPlus Net Holdings are competitive with other vendors and save the Company significant expense. For the nine months ended November 30,
2022 and 2021, Great Earth Power was paid $ 13,300
and $ 20,038 , respectively. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, ABPlus
Net holdings was paid $ 8,640
and $ 10,560 , respectively.
NOTE 8 —
SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS :
Note Payable
In December 2018, the Company was able to settle
an outstanding balance owed to one of its third-party vendors. This settlement resulted in a $ 120,000
note payable being issued to the vendor. Additionally, the Company agreed to issue
2,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock as a part of the settlement agreement. Based on the closing price of the Company’s
common stock on the date of the settlement agreement, the value of the common stock transaction was determined to be $ 6,000 .
The common stock shares were issued during the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. The note had a maturity date of
January
1, 2022
and bears an interest rate of
10 %
rate per annum. The note principal has not been paid and the Company is considered to be in default. There is no default interest
rate associated with the note. Interest is accrued monthly and is payable on January 1 st
of each anniversary date of the
note. At November 30, 2022, the principal and a portion of the accrued interest had not been paid and was outstanding. The accrued
interest on the Note was $ 23,000
and $ 38,000
at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively.
Note Payable – Related Party
Secured Debt
Chief Executive Officer
On December 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Secured
Promissory Note (the “ Note ”), as borrower, with James Forrest Westmoreland and Angela Marie Westmoreland, Co-Trustees
of the James and Angela Westmoreland Revocable Trust, or its assigns (the “ Noteholder ”), as the lender. James F. Westmoreland
is the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Note, the Noteholder loaned the Company an aggregate
principal amount of $ 155,548 . After the deduction of loan fees of $ 10,929
the net proceeds from the loan were $ 144,619 . The loan fees
are being amortized as original issue discount (OID) over the term of the loan. The interest rate of the loan is
2.25 %. The Note requires
monthly payments on the Note balance until repaid in full. The maturity date of the Note is
December 21, 2035 . For the nine months ended
November 30, 2022, the Company made principal payments of $ 6,598
and amortized debt discount of $ 546 . The obligations under the Note are
secured by a lien on and security interest in the Company’s crude oil assets located in Kern County, California, as described in
a Deed of Trust entered into by the Company in favor of the Noteholder to secure the obligations under the Note. Such lien shall be a
first priority lien, subject only to a pre-existing lien filed by a working interest partner of the Company.
The Company may prepay the Note at any time. Upon
the occurrence of any Event of Default and expiration of any applicable cure period, and at any time thereafter during the continuance
of such Event of Default, the Noteholder may at its option, by written notice to the Company: (a) declare the entire principal amount
of the Note, together with all accrued interest thereon and all other amounts payable hereunder, immediately due and payable; (b) exercise
any of its remedies with respect to the collateral set forth in the Deed of Trust; and/or (c) exercise any or all of its other rights,
powers or remedies under applicable law.

Short-term Convertible Note Payable
Convertible Debt
During the twelve months ended February 28, 2022,
the Company executed a convertible promissory note with a third party for $ 200,000 . The interest rate was
18 % per annum and is payable
in kind (PIK) solely by additional shares of the Company’s common stock. Regardless of when the conversion occurred, a full 12 months
of interest would be payable upon conversion. On May 5, 2022, the Company received notice of conversion of the promissory note. The face
amount of the note and $ 36,000
in interest were converted at a rate of $ 0.0085
per share into
27,764,706
shares of the Company’s
common stock during the nine months ended November 30, 2022.
12% Subordinated Notes
Private Placement
Subordinated Debt
The Company’s 12% Subordinated Notes (“the
Notes”) issued pursuant to a January 2010 private placement offering to accredited investors, resulted in $ 595,000
in gross proceeds
(of which $ 250,000
was from a related party) to the Company and accrue interest at
12 % per annum, payable semi-annually on January 29th
and July 29th.
On January 29, 2015, the Company and 12 of the 13 holders of the Notes agreed to extend the maturity date of the Notes
for an additional two years to January 29, 2017. Effective January 29, 2017, the maturity date of the Notes and the expiration date of
the warrants that were issued in conjunction with the Notes were extended for an additional two years to January 29, 2019.
As a result of the Company restructuring its balance
sheet through conversions of related party debt to common stock, the related party 12% Noteholder, James F. Westmoreland, the Company’s
President and Chief Executive Officer, chose to convert the principal and accrued interest of their Notes to the Company’s common
stock. The related party Note for $ 250,000
and accrued interest of $ 264,986
were converted to common stock at a rate of approximately
$ 0.45
for every dollar of principal and interest resulting in
1,144,415
shares of common stock being issued.
During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, one
12% Note holder chose to convert the principal balance and accrued interest in to the Company’s common stock. The $ 25,000
Note and
accrued interest of $ 10,520
were converted at a rate of approximately $ 0.45
for every dollar of principal and interest resulting in
78,934
shares of common stock being issued.
11
The Company has informed the Note holders that the
payment of principal and final interest will be late and is subject to future financing being completed and the Company’s cash flow.
The Notes principal of $ 290,000
has not been paid. The terms of the Notes, state that should the Board of Directors decide that the payment
of the principal and any unpaid interest would impair the financial condition or operations of the Company, the Company may then elect
a mandatory conversion of the unpaid principal and interest into the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate equal to 75% of
the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days preceding December 31, 2018. The accrued
interest on the 12% Notes at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 was $ 150,927
and $ 135,229 , respectively.

Line of Credit
The Company had an existing $ 890,000
line of credit
for working capital purposes with UBS Bank USA (“UBS”), established pursuant to a Credit Line Agreement dated October 24,
2011 that was secured by the personal guarantee of its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. On May 26, 2022, the Company paid
off the outstanding balance of $ 809,930
on the line of credit. The payoff of the line of credit was previously approved under terms of
the Equity Exchange Agreement in which the Company acquired the Reabold property in California. The payoff was a part of the use of proceeds
from the Company’s sale of common stock to a third party.
Production Revenue Payable
Beginning in December 2018, the Company conducted
a fundraising program to fund the drilling of future wells in California and Michigan and to settle some of its historical debt. The purchaser(s)
of a production revenue payment interest received a production revenue payment on future wells to be drilled in California and Michigan
in exchange for their purchase.
The production payment interest entitles the purchasers to receive production payments equal to twice
their original amount paid, payable from a percentage of the Company’s future net production payments from wells drilled after the
date of the purchase and until the Production Payment Target (as described below) is met.  The Company shall pay fifty percent of
its net production payments from the relevant wells to the purchasers until each purchaser has received two times the purchase price (the
“Production Payment Target”). Once the Company pays the purchasers amounts equal to the Production Payment Target, it shall
thereafter pay a pro-rated eight percent (8%) of $1.3 million on its net production payments from the relevant wells to each of the purchasers.
However, if the total raised is less than the target $1.3 million, then the payment will be a proportionate amount of the eight percent
(8%). Additionally, if the Production Payment Target is not met within the first three years, the Company shall pay seventy-five percent
of its production payments from the relevant wells to the purchasers until the Production Payment Target is met.
The Company accounted for the amounts received from
these sales in accordance with ASC 470-10-25 and 470-10-35 which require amounts recorded as debt to be amortized under the interest method
as described in ASC 835-30, Interest Method. Consequently, the net program balance of $ 865,480
has been recognized as a production revenue
payable. The Company determined an effective interest rate based on future expected cash flows to be paid to the holders of the production
payment interests. This rate represents the discount rate that equates estimated cash flows with the initial proceeds received from the
sales and is used to compute the amount of interest to be recognized each period. Estimating the future cash outflows under this agreement
requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions about future revenues and payments and such estimates are subject to significant
variability. Therefore, the estimates are likely to change which may result in future adjustments to the accretion of the interest expense
and the amortized cost based carrying value of the related payables.
Accordingly, the Company has estimated the cash flows
associated with the production revenue payments of $ 951,417
and determined a discount of $ 85,937
as of November 30, 2022, which is being
accounted as interest expense over the estimated period over which payments will be made based on expected future revenue streams. For
the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, amortization of the debt discount on these payables amounted to $ 50,063
and $ 87,008 ,
respectively, which has been included in interest expense in the statements of operations.

WARRANTS :
Share Based Payment Arrangement -
Non-Employee
During the twelve months ended February 29, 2020 there
were
2.1
million warrants issued to a third party for investor relations services. The fair value of the warrants was determined by the
Black-Scholes pricing model, was $ 17,689 , and is being amortized over the
3
year vesting period of the warrants. The Black-Scholes valuation
encompassed the following assumptions: a risk free interest rate of
1.68 %; volatility rate of
260.23 %; and a dividend yield of
0.0 %.
The warrants contains a vesting blocking provision
that prevents the vesting of any warrants that such vesting would cause the warrant holder’s beneficial ownership (as such term
is defined in Section 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) to exceed more than four and ninety-nine one-hundredths
percent (4.99%) of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock. The foregoing restriction may not be waived by either party. The warrants
vested in equal parts over a three year period beginning on January 2, 2020 and were fully vested at January 2, 2022. The warrants expire
on January 2, 2024.
As of November 30, 2022, there were
2,100,000
exercisable
warrants. At November 30, 2022, both the outstanding warrants and the exercisable warrants have a weighted average exercise price of $ 0.01 ,
a weighted average remaining life of
1.08

INCOME TAXES :
On December 22, 2017, the federal government enacted
a tax bill H.R.1, an act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to Titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal
year 2018, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation,
including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from
35 % to
21 % and modifying or limiting many business
deductions. The Company has re-measured its deferred tax liabilities based on rates at which they are expected to be utilized in the future,
which is generally 21%.

At November 30, 2022, the Company had estimated net
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of
approximately
$ 20,434,807
which
will begin to expire, if unused, beginning in 2024. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the NOL portion of the loss
incurred in the year ended
February 28, 2018 of $ 340,749 ; the loss incurred in the year ended February
29, 2020 of $ 339,299 ; the loss incurred in the year ended February 28, 2021 of $ 416,898 ; the loss incurred in the year ended February

will
not expire and will carry over indefinitely. The valuation allowance increased approximately $ 395,506
for the nine months ended November
30, 2022 and increased approximately $ 107,740
for the year ended February 28, 2022,

The above estimates are based on management’s
decisions concerning elections which could change the relationship between net income and taxable income. Management decisions are made
annually and could cause estimates to vary significantly. The Company files federal income tax returns with the United States Internal
Revenue Service and state income tax returns in various state tax jurisdictions. As a general rule the Company’s tax returns for
the fiscal years after 2016 currently remain subject to examinations by appropriate tax authorities. None of our tax returns are under
examination at this time.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES :
Various lawsuits, claims and other contingencies arise
in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities. While the ultimate outcome of any future contingency is not determinable
at this time, management believes that any liability or loss resulting therefrom will not materially affect the financial position, results
of operations or cash flows of the Company.
The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of
crude oil properties, is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and
protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under a crude oil lease
for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. In some instances,
the Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. The Company maintains insurance coverage that is customary
in the industry, although the Company is not fully insured against all environmental risks.
Sunflower Lawsuit
Sunflower Alliance v. California Department of Conservation,
Geologic Energy Management Division.  This case challenges the state agency’s compliance with the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) with respect to the PAL Reabold 072-00-0001 Project, for wastewater injection into an existing well.  The Petition
was filed on December 29, 2021 in the Alameda County Superior Court.  The Petitioner seeks an order setting aside the state agency’s
approval of a wastewater injection permit; damages are not sought in the lawsuit.  On February 22, 2022, Real Party in Interest Reabold
California, LLC filed a motion to transfer the case to the Contra Costa County Superior Court.  On March 22, 2022, the Alameda County
Superior Court ordered the case transferred to the Contra Costa County Superior Court.  On August 15, 2022, the Contra Costa County
Superior Court provided notice that the transfer had been completed and the case filed in that court.  If successful, the lawsuit
would prevent Reabold from injecting wastewater into an existing well until any CEQA deficiencies are addressed.  The California
Attorney General is defending the state agency, which disputes Petitioner’s claims.  On December 22, 2022, the Superior Court
issued an order finding CEQA deficiencies, and directing the state agency to rescind its approval of the project. Reabold will appeal
the Superior Court’s order. At this time, it is unclear when the litigation will be resolved.
The Company is not aware of any environmental claims
existing as of November 30, 2022. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or that past
non-compliance with environmental issues will not be discovered on the Company’s crude oil properties.

process and are subject to revision.
Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described
above or elsewhere in our Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2022 and in this Form 10-Q for the nine months ended November 30,
2022 occur, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed
in any forward-looking statements. We specifically undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any information contained in any
forward-looking statement or any forward-looking statement in its entirety, whether as a result of new information, future events, or
otherwise, except as required by law.

All forward-looking statements attributable to us
are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
Introduction and Overview
We are an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration,
development and production company. Our basic business model is to increase shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and
natural gas reserves through exploration and development activities, and selling the production from those reserves at a profit. To be
successful, we must, over time, be able to find crude oil and natural gas reserves and then sell the resulting production at a price that
is sufficient to cover our finding costs, operating expenses, administrative costs and interest expense, plus offer us a return on our
capital investment. A secondary means of generating returns can include the sale of either producing or non-producing lease properties.
Our longer-term success depends on, among many other
factors, the acquisition and drilling of commercial grade crude oil and natural gas properties and on the prevailing sales prices for
crude oil and natural gas along with associated operating expenses. The volatile nature of the energy markets makes it difficult to estimate
future prices of crude oil and natural gas; however, any prolonged period of depressed prices or market volatility, such as we have experienced
in the last 18 months, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our operations are focused on identifying and evaluating
prospective crude oil and natural gas properties and funding projects that we believe have the potential to produce crude oil and natural
gas in commercial quantities. We conduct all of our drilling, exploration and production activities in the United States, and all of our
revenues are derived from sales to customers within the United States. Currently, we are in the process of developing a multi-well oilfield
project in Kern County, California.
Our management cannot provide any assurances that
Daybreak will ever operate profitably. While, in the past, we have had positive cash flow from our crude oil operations in the East Slopes
project in California, we have not yet generated sustainable positive cash flow or earnings on a company-wide basis. As a small company,
we are more susceptible to the numerous business, investment and industry risks that have been described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and in Part III, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this 10-Q Report. Throughout
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, crude oil is shown in barrels (“Bbls”); natural gas is shown in thousands of cubic feet
(“Mcf”) unless otherwise specified, and hydrocarbon totals are expressed in barrels of crude oil equivalent (“BOE”).
Below is brief summary of our two crude oil and natural
gas projects in California. Refer to our discussion in Item 2. Properties, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February
28, 2022 for more information on our multi-well oilfield East Slopes project in California.
Kern County, California (East Slopes Project)
The East Slopes Project is located in the southeastern
part of the San Joaquin Basin near Bakersfield, California. Drilling targets are porous and permeable sandstone reservoirs that exist
at depths of 1,200 feet to 4,500 feet. Since January 2009, we have participated in the drilling of 25 wells in this project. We have been
the Operator at the East Slopes Project since March 2009.
The crude oil produced from our acreage in the Vedder
Sand is considered heavy oil. The gravity of the crude oil ranges from 14 °
to 16 °
API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity and must be heated to separate and remove water prior to sale. Our crude oil wells in the East
Slopes Project produce from five reservoirs at our Sunday, Bear, Black, Ball and Dyer Creek locations. The Sunday property has six producing
wells, while the Bear property has nine producing wells. The Black property is the smallest of all currently producing reservoirs, and
currently has two producing wells at this property. The Ball property also has two producing wells while the Dyer Creek property has one
producing well. During the nine months ended November 30, 2022 we normally had production from 20 crude oil wells, however during this
same nine month time period multiple wells had workovers done to replace the downhole pumps. Our average working interest (“WI”)
and net revenue interest (“NRI”) in these 20 wells is 36.6% and 27.6%, respectively.
We plan on acquiring additional acreage exhibiting
the same seismic characteristics and on trend with the Bear, Black and Dyer Creek reservoirs. Some of these prospects, if successful,
would utilize the Company’s existing production facilities. In addition to the current field development, there are several other
exploratory prospects that have been identified from the seismic data, which we plan to drill in the future.

East Slopes, Kern County, California Drilling Plans
We are currently in the planning and permitting process
to undertake a multi-well developmental drilling program commencing in the second quarter of 2023. These plans are also dependent on a
stabilization of crude oil prices. We plan to spend approximately $825,000 drilling three development wells and one water disposal well
in this drilling program.
Monterey and Contra Costa Counties, California
(Reabold California, LLC)
In May 2022, we acquired Reabold California, LLC (“Reabold”)
from a third party. This property includes producing wells in both Monterey and Contra Costa counties of California.
The Burnett Lease and the Doud Lease are located in
close proximity to each another in Monterey County. They are part of a geological feature named the Monroe Swell. The Burnett Lease presently
has two directional wells that are being produced from a depth of 2,900’ from the Beedy Sand zone. The oil being produced is approximately
17 °
API gravity. We have future plans of drilling one horizontal well on this lease and to
convert an old well bore into a salt water disposal well (“SWD”). The Doud Lease has four directional well bores with three
of those being produced from a depth of 3,300’ from the Doud A Sand zone. The oil being produced is approximately 23 °
API gravity. We have future plans of drilling one additional directional well on this lease. The SWD for the Burnett Lease will be utilized
for the Doud lease as well.
The Brentwood Lease is located in Contra-Costa County.
This lease is part of a geological feature named the Meganos Unconformity. There are presently two directional wells producing from this
lease. A work over was successfully completed on a third well to decrease water production and to increase oil production. This third
well will be put back on production once the Sunflower Alliance lawsuit is settled and a SWD permit has been approved. The wells are
producing from the Second Massive Sand from a depth of between 4,000’- 4,500’. The oil being produced is approximately 38 °
gravity.
Sunflower Lawsuit
Sunflower Alliance v. California Department of Conservation,
Geologic Energy Management Division.  This case challenges the state agency’s compliance with the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) with respect to the PAL Reabold 072-00-0001 Project, for wastewater injection into an existing well.  The Petition
was filed on December 29, 2021 in the Alameda County Superior Court.  The Petitioner seeks an order setting aside the state agency’s
approval of a wastewater injection permit; damages are not sought in the lawsuit.  On February 22, 2022, Real Party in Interest Reabold
California, LLC filed a motion to transfer the case to the Contra Costa County Superior Court.  On March 22, 2022, the Alameda County
Superior Court ordered the case transferred to the Contra Costa County Superior Court.  On August 15, 2022, the Contra Costa County
Superior Court provided notice that the transfer had been completed and the case filed in that court.  If successful, the lawsuit
would prevent Reabold from injecting wastewater into an existing well until any CEQA deficiencies are addressed.  The California
Attorney General is defending the state agency, which disputes Petitioner’s claims.  On December 22, 2022, the Superior Court
issued an order finding CEQA deficiencies, and directing the state agency to rescind its approval of the project. Reabold will appeal
the Superior Court’s order. At this time, it is unclear when the litigation will be resolved.
The Company is not aware of any environmental claims
existing as of November 30, 2022. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or that past
non-compliance with environmental issues will not be discovered on the Company’s crude oil properties.
Encumbrances
On October 17, 2018, a working interest partner in
the East Slopes Project in California filed a UCC financing statement in regards to payables owed to the partner by the Company.
Results of Operations – Nine months ended November
30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021
California Crude Oil Prices
The prices we receive for crude oil sales in California
from the East Slopes project and from Reabold California, LLC (“Reabold”) are based on prices posted for Midway-Sunset and
Buena Vista crude oil delivery contracts, respectively. All posted pricing is subject to adjustments that vary by grade of crude oil,
transportation costs, market differentials and other local conditions. Both the posted Midway-Sunset and Buena Vista prices generally
move in correlation to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX”) for spot West Texas intermediate (“WTI”)
crude oil, Cushing, Oklahoma delivery contracts.
18
California Natural Gas Prices
The price we receive for natural gas sales from Reabold
is based on ninety-five percent (95%) of the price published in Natural Gas Intelligence (“NGI”) Gas Price Index under the
column “Bidweek Averages” for “California”, “PG&E Citygate” less an amount per MMBtu equal to
the Silverado Path On System As-Available transport date, less the Silverado Path On System transmission shrinkage rate for Silverado.
The price we receive generally moves in correlation to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX”) for spot Henry
Hub natural gas prices.
There continues to be a significant amount of volatility
in hydrocarbon prices and a corresponding fluctuation in our realized sale price of crude oil does exist. An example of this volatility
is that in June of 2014 the monthly average price of WTI oil was $105.79 per barrel and our realized price per barrel of crude oil was
$98.78. For example, in April 2020, the monthly average price of WTI crude oil was $16.55 and our monthly realized price was $16.96 per
barrel. Then in May 2022, the monthly average price of WTI oil was $109.55 per barrel and our realized price per barrel of crude oil was
$106.56. Finally, in November 2022, our average realized price was $84.37 per barrel. This volatility in crude oil prices has continued
throughout most of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023. Any downward volatility in the price of crude oil will have a prolonged and
substantial negative impact on our profitability and cash flow from our producing California properties. It is beyond our ability to accurately
predict crude oil prices over any substantial length of time.
A comparison of the average WTI crude oil price and
the average realized crude oil sales price for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 is shown in the table below:

than the average WTI price. In comparison, for the nine months ended November 30, 2021, the average WTI price was $70.34 and our average
realized sale price was $67.97 representing a discount of $2.37 per barrel or 3.4% lower than the average WTI price.
California Crude Oil Revenue and Production
Crude oil revenue in California for the nine months
ended November 30, 2022 increased $733,653 or 145.2146.6% to $1,239,063 in comparison to revenue of $505,410 for the nine months ended
November 30, 2021. The reason for the increase was the acquisition of the Reabold California, LLC wells in central California. The average
sale price of a barrel of crude oil for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 was $95.69 in comparison to $67.97 for the nine months
ended November 30, 2021. The increase of $27.72 or 40.8% per barrel in the average realized price of a barrel of crude oil accounted for
27.8% of the increase in crude oil revenue for the nine months ended November 30, 2022.
Our net crude oil sales volume for the nine months
ended November 30, 2022 was 13,027 barrels of crude oil in comparison to 7,436 barrels sold for the nine months ended November 30, 2021.
This increase in crude oil sales volume of 5,591 barrels or 75.2% was primarily due to our acquisition of the Reabold property and its
producing wells in central California. The gravity of our produced crude oil in the East Slopes project ranges between 14° API and
16° API. Historically, the sale price we receive for East Slopes crude oil has been less than the quoted WTI price because of the
lower API gravity of our East Slopes crude oil in comparison to the API gravity of quoted WTI crude oil. The gravity of our produced crude
oil in the Reabold project ranges between 17° API and 38° API.

Production expenses include expenses associated with
the production of crude oil. These expenses include contract pumpers, electricity, road maintenance, control of well insurance, property
taxes and well workover expenses; and, relate directly to the number of wells that are in production. For the nine months ended November
30, 2022, these expenses increased by $577,093 or 349.0% to $742,450 in comparison to $165,357 for the nine months ended November 30,
2021. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we had 25 wells on production from the East Slopes and Reabold projects in comparison
to 20 wells on production in the East Slopes project for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The increase of four wells was from
the Reabold acquisition that occurred in late May 2022. The increase in production expenses for the nine months ended November 30, 2022,
was primarily due to the replacement and upgrading of pumps in seven wells of the East Slopes project for $56,549 and the expenses associated
with salt water disposal of $318,052 from the Reabold project. A salt water disposal well is currently being permitted which, when put
into operation is expected to significantly lower operating costs of the Reabold project. Production expense on a barrel of oil equivalent
(“BOE”) basis for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 were $55.81 and $22.24, respectively. Production expenses
represented 27.5% and 25.1% of total operating expenses for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Exploration and drilling expenses include geological
and geophysical (“G&G”) expenses as well as leasehold maintenance, plugging and abandonment (“P&A”) expenses
and dry hole expenses. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, these expenses were $1,170 and $235, respectively. Exploration
and drilling expenses represented 0.1% and 0.0% of total operating expenses for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”)
expenses relate to equipment, proven reserves and property costs, along with impairment, and is another component of operating expenses.
For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, DD&A expenses increased $170,042 or 386.4% to $214,046 in comparison to $44,004 for the
nine months ended November 30, 2021. On a BOE basis, DD&A expense was $16.09 and $5.92 for the nine months ended November 30, 2022
and 2021, respectively. DD&A expenses represented 7.6% and 6.7% of total operating expenses for the nine months ended November 30,
2022 and 2021, respectively.
For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we incurred
transaction expenses of $1,086,154 related to the acquisition of funding and to acquire the Reabold crude oil and natural gas properties
located in central California. For the nine months ended November 30, 2021, we did not incur any related expenses. Transaction expenses
represented 38.5% and 0.0% of total operating expenses for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
20
General and administrative (“G&A”)
expenses include the salaries of nine employees, including management. Other items included in our G&A expenses are legal and accounting
expenses, investor relations fees, travel expenses, insurance expenses and other administrative expenses necessary for an operation of
crude oil and natural gas properties as well as for the running a public company. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, G&A
expenses increased $327,497 or 73.1% to $775,449 in comparison to $447,952 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The primary reasons
for the increase in G&A expense are related to the expenses of both the special shareholders and the annual shareholders meetings,
in the amount of approximately $122,200 in aggregate, that were held during the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and professional legal
and accounting fees of approximately $70,000 related to the Reabold acquisition. We are continuing a program of controlling our G&A
costs wherever possible. G&A expenses represented 27.5% and 68.2% of total operating expenses for the nine months ended November 30,
2022 and 2021, respectively.
During the nine months ended
November 30, 2021, the Company recognized a gain on asset disposal of $9,614. The gain was the result of an insurance settlement on the
theft of a company vehicle that was fully depreciated. Additionally, during the nine months ended November 30, 2021, the Company recognized
a gain on debt forgiveness in the amount of $72,800 due to notification that the SBA had approved the company’s application for
loan forgiveness on a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 2 nd  Draw loan.
Interest expense, net for the nine months ended November
30, 2022 decreased $54,363 or 30.5% to $123,857 in comparison to $178,220 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021.

California Crude Oil Revenue and Production
Crude oil revenue in California for the three months
ended November 30, 2022, increased $271,373 or 143.7% to $460,165 in comparison to revenue of $188,792 for the three months ended November
30, 2021. The primary reason for the increase was the acquisition of the Reabold California, LLC wells in central California. The average
sale price of a barrel of crude oil for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $85.39 in comparison to $74.12 for the three months
ended November 30, 2021. The increase of $11.27 or 15.2% per barrel in the average realized price of a barrel of crude oil accounted for
120.6% of the increase in crude oil revenue for the three months ended November 30, 2022.
Our net sales volume for the three months ended November
30, 2022 was 5,389 barrels of crude oil in comparison to 2,547 barrels sold for the three months ended November 30, 2021. This increase
in crude oil sales volume of 2,842 barrels or 111.6% was due to our acquisition of the Reabold property and its producing wells in central
California. The gravity of our produced crude oil in the East Slopes project ranges between 14° API and 16° API. Historically,
the sale price we receive for East Slopes heavy crude oil has been less than the quoted WTI price because of the lower API gravity of
our California crude oil in comparison to the API gravity of quoted WTI crude oil. The gravity of our produced crude oil in the Reabold
project ranges between 17° API and 38° API.

Interest expense, net for the three months ended November
30, 2022 decreased $77,342 to $14,719 due to an adjustment from prior periods in comparison to ($62,623) for the three months ended November
30, 2021.
Due to the nature of our business, we expect that
revenues, as well as all categories of expenses, will continue to fluctuate substantially on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis.
Revenues are highly dependent on the volatility of hydrocarbon prices and production volumes. Production expenses will fluctuate according
to the number and percentage ownership of producing wells as well as the amount of revenues we receive based on the price of crude oil.
Exploration and drilling expenses will be dependent upon the amount of capital that we have to invest in future development projects,
as well as the success or failure of such projects. Likewise, the amount of DD&A expense will depend upon the factors cited above
including the size of our proven reserves base and the market price of energy products. G&A expenses will also fluctuate based on
our current requirements, but will generally tend to increase as we expand the business operations of the Company. An on-going goal of
the Company is to improve cash flow to cover the current level of G&A expenses and to fund our drilling programs in California and
Michigan.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Our primary financial resource is our proven crude
oil reserve base. Our ability to fund any future capital expenditure programs is dependent upon the prices we receive from crude oil sales,
the success of our drilling programs in California and the availability of capital resource financing. There continues to be a significant
amount of volatility in crude oil prices and dramatic fluctuation in our realized sale price of crude oil since June of 2014, when the
monthly average price of WTI crude oil was $105.79 per barrel, and our realized sale price per barrel of crude oil was $98.78. For example,
in the month of April 2020 the monthly average closing price of WTI crude oil was $16.55 and our monthly realized oil price was $16.96
per barrel. Then in in May, 2022, the monthly average price of WTI oil was $109.55 per barrel and our realized price per barrel of crude
oil was $106.56. In November, 2022, our average realized price was $84.37 per barrel. This volatility in crude oil prices continued into
the current fiscal year. Any downward volatility in the price of crude oil will have a prolonged and substantial negative impact on our
profitability and cash flow from our producing California properties. It is beyond our ability to accurately predict crude oil prices
over any substantial length of time.
East Slopes, Kern County, California Drilling Plans
We are currently in the planning and permitting process
to undertake a multi-well developmental drilling program commencing in the second quarter of 2023. These plans are also dependent on a
stabilization of crude oil prices. We plan to spend approximately $825,000 drilling three development wells and one water disposal well
in this drilling program.
Changes in our capital resources at November 30, 2022
in comparison to February 28, 2022 are set forth in the table below:

Our working capital deficit decreased approximately
$1.13 million or 37.9% to approximately $1.85 million at November 30, 2022 in comparison to approximately $2.99 million at February 28,
2022. The decrease in our working capital deficit was primarily due to the proceeds we received in connection with the sale of common
stock and the acquisition of the Reabold California, LLC current assets. We anticipate an increase in our cash flow will occur when we
are able to return to our planned drilling program that will result in an increase in the number of successful wells on production.
Our business is capital intensive. Our ability to
grow is dependent upon favorably obtaining outside capital and generating cash flows from operating activities necessary to fund our investment
activities. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability. Since our future operations will continue to be dependent
on successful exploration and development activities and our ability to seek and secure capital from external sources, should we be unable
to achieve sustainable profitability this could cause any equity investment in the Company to become worthless.
23
Major sources of funds in the past for us have included
the debt or equity markets and the sale of assets. We anticipate that we will have to rely on these capital markets to fund future operations
and growth. Our business model is focused on acquiring exploration or development properties as well as existing production. Our ability
to generate future revenues and operating cash flow will depend on successful exploration, and/or acquisition of crude oil producing properties,
which may very likely require us to continue to raise equity or debt capital from outside sources.
Daybreak has ongoing capital commitments to develop
certain leases pursuant to their underlying terms. Failure to meet such ongoing commitments may result in the loss of the right to participate
in future drilling on certain leases or the loss of the lease itself. These ongoing capital commitments will cause us to seek additional
forms of financing through various methods, including issuing debt securities, equity securities, bank debt, or combinations of these
instruments which could result in dilution to existing security holders and increased debt and leverage. The current uncertainty in the
credit and capital markets as well as the instability and volatility in crude oil prices since June of 2014, has restricted our ability
to obtain needed capital. The 2019 novel coronavirus (“COVID-19") and its subsequent variants that spread to countries throughout
the world including the United States continue to have an uncertain negative impact on the financial and energy markets. No assurance
can be given that we will be able to obtain funding under any loan commitments or any additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.
Sales of interests in our assets may be another source of cash flow available to us.
The Company’s financial statements for the nine
months ended November 30, 2022 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred net losses since entering the crude oil exploration industry in 2005,
and as of the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we have an accumulated deficit of $31.2 million and a working capital deficit of $1.85
million which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
In the current fiscal year, we will need to seek additional
financing for our planned exploration and development activities in California. We could obtain financing through one or more various
methods, including issuing debt securities, equity securities, or bank debt, or combinations of these instruments, which could result
in dilution to existing security holders and increased debt and leverage. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain funding
under any loan commitments or any additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. Sales of interests in our assets may be another
source of cash flow.
Changes in Financial Condition
During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we
received crude oil sales revenue from our 20 producing wells in the East slopes project as well as crude oil and natural gas sales revenue
from five producing wells in the recently acquired Reabold project. Both of these projects are located in California. Our commitment to
improving corporate profitability remains unchanged. We experienced an increase in revenues of $749,247 or 148.2% to $1,254,657 for the
nine months ended November 30, 2022 in comparison to revenues of $505,410 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The increase of
$26.90 or 39.5% in the average realized price BOE accounted for 26.4% of the increase in crude oil revenue for the nine months ended November
30, 2022. The increase in sales volume BOE accounted for the remaining 73.6% of the revenue increase. The increase in volume was primarily
due to the producing wells that we acquired in the recently completed acquisition of Reabold California, LLC. For the nine months ended
November 30, 2022, we had an operating loss of $1,564,612 in comparison to an operating loss of $152,138 for the nine months ended November
30, 2021. The increase in the operating loss was due to transaction expenses related to the acquisition of the Reabold property, fundraising,
and the expenses of holding both a special shareholders’ meeting to approve the acquisition and a regular annual shareholders meeting.
Our balance sheet at November 30, 2022 reflects total
assets of approximately $8.8 million in comparison to approximately $0.98 million at February 28, 2022. The increase of approximately
$7.8 million is directly related to the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas assets in California.
At November 30, 2022, total liabilities decreased
by approximately $21,600 to approximately $4.3 million in comparison to approximately $4.3 million at February 28, 2022.
At November 30, 2022, there were 384,735,402 issued
and outstanding shares of common stock in comparison to 67,802,273 shares at February 28, 2022. The increase in shares issued and outstanding
of 316,933,129 shares was directly related to the acquisition of producing crude oil and natural gas assets, associated fundraising and
the restructuring of our balance sheet eliminating debt in exchange for equity.
24
Additional paid in capital (APIC) increased approximately
$9.2 million at November 30, 2022 to $35,297,706 from $26,115,450 at February 28, 2022, as a result of the same acquisition of producing
crude oil and natural gas assets, associated fundraising and the restructuring of our balance sheet eliminating debt in exchange for equity.

Cash Flow Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities
Cash flow from operating activities is derived from
the production of our crude oil reserves and changes in the balances of non-cash accounts, receivables, payables or other non-energy property
asset account balances. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022, cash flow used in operating activities was $599,420 in comparison
to cash flow provided by operating activities of $31,984 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The increase in our cash flow used
in operating activities of $631,404 for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in our accounts receivable
crude oil and natural gas sales and receivables from our working interest partners. Both of these increases were directly related to our
acquisition of producing crude oil and natural gas assets in California from a third party. Changes in non-cash account balances primarily
relating to financing fees, DD&A and amortization of debt discount increased by approximately $644,000 in comparison to the nine month
ended November 30, 2021. Variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures.
Cash Flow Used In Investing Activities
Cash flow from investing activities is derived from
changes in crude oil property balances and any lending activities. Cash flow used in our investing activities for the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 was $-0- in comparison to cash flow used in our investing activities of $14,673 for the nine months ended November 30,
2021.
Cash Flow Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities
Cash flow from financing activities is derived from
changes in long-term liability account balances or in equity account balances, excluding retained earnings. Cash flow provided by our
financing activities was $1,138,345 for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 in comparison to cash flow used in our financing activities
of $33,447 for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. During the nine months ended November 30, 2022 we secured a capital raise of $1,987,500
net of transaction expenses from the sale of 128,125,000 shares of our common stock. Additionally, during the nine months ended November
30, 2022, we paid off the balance of $808,182 on the line of credit with UBS Bank.
The following discussion is a summary of cash flows
provided by, and used in, the Company’s financing activities at November 30, 2022.
SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM
BORROWINGS:
Note Payable
In December 2018, the Company was able to settle an
outstanding balance owed to one of its third-party vendors. This settlement resulted in a $120,000 note payable being issued to the vendor.
Additionally, the Company agreed to issue 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock as a part of the settlement agreement.
Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the settlement agreement, the value of the common stock
transaction was determined to be $6,000. The common stock shares were issued during the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. The note
had a maturity date of January 1, 2022, and bears an interest rate of 10% rate per annum. The note principal has not been paid and the
Company is considered to be in default. There is no default interest rate associated with the note. Interest is accrued monthly and is
payable on January 1 st
of each anniversary date of the note. At November 30, 2022, the note principal and a portion of the
accrued interest had not been paid and was outstanding. The accrued interest on the Note was $23,000 and $38,000 at November 30, 2022
and February 28, 2022, respectively.
25
Note Payable – Related Party
On December 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Secured
Promissory Note (the “ Note ”), as borrower, with James Forrest Westmoreland and Angela Marie Westmoreland, Co-Trustees
of the James and Angela Westmoreland Revocable Trust, or its assigns (the “ Noteholder ”), as the lender. James F. Westmoreland
is the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Note, the Noteholder loaned the Company an aggregate
principal amount of $155,548. After the deduction of loan fees of $10,929 the net proceeds from the loan were $144,619. The loan fees
are being amortized as original issue discount (OID) over the term of the loan. The interest rate of the loan is 2.25%. The Note requires
monthly payments on the Note balance until repaid in full. The maturity date of the Note is December 21, 2035. For the nine months ended
November 30, 2022, the Company made principal payments of $6,598 and amortized debt discount of $546. The obligations under the Note are
secured by a lien on and security interest in the Company’s crude oil assets located in Kern County, California, as described in
a Deed of Trust entered into by the Company in favor of the Noteholder to secure the obligations under the Note. Such lien shall be a
first priority lien, subject only to a pre-existing lien filed by a working interest partner of the Company.
The Company may prepay the Note at any time. Upon
the occurrence of any Event of Default and expiration of any applicable cure period, and at any time thereafter during the continuance
of such Event of Default, the Noteholder may at its option, by written notice to the Company: (a) declare the entire principal amount
of the Note, together with all accrued interest thereon and all other amounts payable hereunder, immediately due and payable; (b) exercise
any of its remedies with respect to the collateral set forth in the Deed of Trust; and/or (c) exercise any or all of its other rights,
powers or remedies under applicable law.

Short-term Convertible Note Payable
During the twelve months ended February 28, 2022,
the Company executed a convertible promissory note with a third party for $200,000. The interest rate was 18% per annum and is payable
in kind (PIK) solely by additional shares of the Company’s common stock. Regardless of when the conversion occurred, a full 12 months
of interest would be payable upon conversion. On May 5, 2022, the Company received notice of conversion of the promissory note. The face
amount of the note and $36,000 in interest were converted at a rate of $0.0085 per share into 27,764,706 share of the Company’s
common stock during the nine months ended November 30, 2022.
26
12% Subordinated Notes
The Company’s 12% Subordinated Notes (“the
Notes”) issued pursuant to a January 2010 private placement offering to accredited investors, resulted in $595,000 in gross proceeds
(of which $250,000 was from a related party) to the Company and accrue interest at 12% per annum, payable semi-annually on January 29th
and July 29th. On January 29, 2015, the Company and 12 of the 13 holders of the Notes agreed to extend the maturity date of the Notes
for an additional two years to January 29, 2017. Effective January 29, 2017, the maturity date of the Notes and the expiration date of
the warrants that were issued in conjunction with the Notes were extended for an additional two years to January 29, 2019.
As a result of the Company restructuring its balance
sheet through conversions of related party debt to common stock, the related party 12% Noteholder, James F. Westmoreland, the Company’s
President and Chief Executive Officer, chose to convert the principal and accrued interest of their Notes to the Company’s common
stock. The related party Note for $250,000 and accrued interest of $264,986 were converted to common stock at a rate of approximately
$0.45 for every dollar of principal and interest resulting in 1,144,415 shares of common stock being issued.
During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, one
12% Note holder chose to convert the principal balance and accrued interest in to the Company’s common stock. The $25,000 Note and
accrued interest of $10,520 were converted at a rate of approximately $0.45 for every dollar of principal and interest resulting in 78,934
shares of common stock being issued.
The Company has informed the Note holders that the
payment of principal and final interest will be late and is subject to future financing being completed and the Company’s cash flow.
The Notes principal of $290,000 has not been paid. The terms of the Notes, state that should the Board of Directors decide that the payment
of the principal and any unpaid interest would impair the financial condition or operations of the Company, the Company may then elect
a mandatory conversion of the unpaid principal and interest into the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate equal to 75% of
the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days preceding December 31, 2018. The accrued
interest on the 12% Notes at November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 was $150,927 and $135,229, respectively.

Line of Credit
The Company had an existing $890,000 line of credit
for working capital purposes with UBS Bank USA (“UBS”), established pursuant to a Credit Line Agreement dated October 24,
2011 that was secured by the personal guarantee of its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. On May 26, 2022, the Company paid
off the outstanding balance of $809,930 on the line of credit. The payoff of the line of credit was previously approved under terms of
the Equity Exchange Agreement in which the Company acquired the Reabold property in California. The payoff was a part of the use of proceeds
from the Company’s sale of common stock to a third party.
Production Revenue Payable
Beginning in December 2018, the Company conducted
a fundraising program to fund the drilling of future wells in California and Michigan and to settle some of its historical debt. The purchaser(s)
of a production revenue payment interest received a production revenue payment on future wells to be drilled in California and Michigan
in exchange for their purchase. The production payment interest entitles the purchasers to receive production payments equal to twice
their original amount paid, payable from a percentage of the Company’s future net production payments from wells drilled after the
date of the purchase and until the Production Payment Target (as described below) is met.  The Company shall pay fifty percent of
its net production payments from the relevant wells to the purchasers until each purchaser has received two times the purchase price (the
“Production Payment Target”). Once the Company pays the purchasers amounts equal to the Production Payment Target, it shall
thereafter pay a pro-rated eight percent (8%) of $1.3 million on its net production payments from the relevant wells to each of the purchasers.
However, if the total raised is less than the target $1.3 million, then the payment will be a proportionate amount of the eight percent
(8%). Additionally, if the Production Payment Target is not met within the first three years, the Company shall pay seventy-five percent
of its production payments from the relevant wells to the purchasers until the Production Payment Target is met.
27
The Company accounted for the amounts received from
these sales in accordance with ASC 470-10-25 and 470-10-35 which require amounts recorded as debt to be amortized under the interest method
as described in ASC 835-30, Interest Method. Consequently, the net program balance of $865,480 has been recognized as a production revenue
payable. The Company determined an effective interest rate based on future expected cash flows to be paid to the holders of the production
payment interests. This rate represents the discount rate that equates estimated cash flows with the initial proceeds received from the
sales and is used to compute the amount of interest to be recognized each period. Estimating the future cash outflows under this agreement
requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions about future revenues and payments and such estimates are subject to significant
variability. Therefore, the estimates are likely to change which may result in future adjustments to the accretion of the interest expense
and the amortized cost based carrying value of the related payables.
Accordingly, the Company has estimated the cash flows
associated with the production revenue payments of $951,417 and determined a discount of $85,937 as of November 30, 2022, which is being
accounted as interest expense over the estimated period over which payments will be made based on expected future revenue streams. For
the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, amortization of the debt discount on these payables amounted to $50,063 and $87,008,
respectively, which has been included in interest expense in the statements of operations.

Operating Leases
The Company leases approximately 988 rentable square
feet of office space from an unaffiliated third party for our former corporate office located in Spokane Valley, Washington. Additionally,
we lease approximately 416 and 695 rentable square feet from unaffiliated third parties for our regional operations office in Friendswood,
Texas and storage and auxiliary office space in Wallace, Idaho, respectively. The lease in Friendswood is a 12 month lease that expires
in October 2022. The Spokane Valley and Wallace leases are currently on a month-to-month basis. The Company’s lease agreements do
not contain any residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or variable lease payments. The Company has not entered into any financing
leases.
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease
at inception. Operating leases are recorded in operating lease right of use assets, net, operating lease liability – current, and
operating lease liability – long-term on its balance sheet.
Rent expense for the nine months ended November 30,
2022 and 2021 was $17,867 and $17,542, respectively.
Related Party Transactions
In California at the East Slopes Project, two of the
vendors that the Company uses for services are partially owned by a related party, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. The Company’s
Chief Operating Officer is a 50% owner in both Great Earth Power and ABPlus Net Holdings. Great Earth Power began providing a portion
of the solar power electrical service for production operations in July 2020. ABPlus Net Holdings began providing portable tank rentals
to the Company as a part of its water treatment and disposal operations in September 2020. The services provided by Great Earth Power
and ABPlus Net Holdings are competitive with other vendors and save the Company significant expense. For the nine months ended November
30, 2022 and 2021, Great Earth Power was paid $13,300 and $20,038, respectively. For the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021,
ABPlus Net holdings was paid $8,640 and $10,560, respectively.
28
Capital Commitments
Daybreak has ongoing capital commitments to develop
certain leases pursuant to their underlying terms. Failure to meet such ongoing commitments may result in the loss of the right to participate
in future drilling on certain leases or the loss of the lease itself. These ongoing capital commitments may also cause us to seek additional
capital from sources outside of the Company. The current uncertainty in the credit and capital markets, and the current economic downturn
in the energy sector, may restrict our ability to obtain needed capital.
Management Plans to Continue as a Going Concern
We continue to implement plans to enhance our ability
to continue as a going concern. Daybreak currently has a net revenue interest (“NRI”) in 20 producing crude oil wells in its
East Slopes Project located in Kern County, California (the “East Slopes Project”). The revenue from these wells has created
a steady and reliable source of income for the Company. The Company’s average working interest (“WI”) in these wells
is 36.6% and the average net revenue interest (“NRI”) is 27.6% for these same wells.
In May 2022, we acquired Reabold California, LLC (“Reabold”)
from a third party. This property currently includes four producing wells, five shut-in wells, and two potential disposal wells in the
Monterey and Contra Costa counties of California. We have a 50% working interest with a 40% net revenue interest in this project.
In conjunction with our acquisition of Reabold, we
were able to secure a capital raise of $2,500,000 through the issuances of the Company’s common stock.
We anticipate our revenue will continue to increase
as the Company participates in the drilling of more wells in the East Slopes and the Reabold Projects in California. Daybreak’s
sources of funds in the past have included the debt or equity markets and the sale of assets. It will be necessary for us to obtain additional
funding from the private or public debt or equity markets in the future. However, we cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful
in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.
Our financial statements as of November 30, 2022 do
not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute our plans to improve our ability to continue
as a going concern.

ABOUT MARKET RISK
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information otherwise required by this Item.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the reporting period, November 30,
2022, an evaluation was conducted by Daybreak management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is also serving as
our interim principal finance and accounting officer, as to the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within required time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. Additionally, it is vital that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, in a manner to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls were effective as of November 30, 2022.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the three months ended November 30, 2022, there
have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations
Our management does not expect that our disclosure
controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. A control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be
met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitation
of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
