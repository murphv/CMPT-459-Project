Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this report other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding COVID-19's anticipated impacts on our business, our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, our market growth and trends, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “potentially,” “preliminary,” “likely,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described under Part II, Item 1A. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the effect of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. We do not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Quantum Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“Quantum” or the “Company”), is a leader in storing and managing digital video and other forms of unstructured data, delivering top streaming performance for video and rich media applications, along with low-cost, long-term storage systems for data protection and archiving. The Company helps customers around the world capture, create and share digital data and preserve and protect it for decades. The Company’s software-defined, hyperconverged storage solutions span from non-violate memory express (“NVMe”), to solid state drives (“SSD”) hard disk drives (“HDD”) tape, the cloud, and video surveillance and are tied together leveraging a single namespace view of the entire data environment. The Company works closely with a broad network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), direct marketing resellers (“DMRs”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and other suppliers to meet customers’ evolving needs. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading. However, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included within the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring items, necessary to present fairly our financial position as of December 31, 2022, the results of operations and comprehensive loss, statements of cash flows, and changes in stockholder's deficit for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full year performance because of the impact of seasonal and short-term variations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the determination of standalone selling price for revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, stock-based compensation and provision for income taxes including related reserves. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which management believes to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Recently Issued but not Adopted Accounting Pronouncements None.

unamortized debt issuance costs
(1) ( 3,611 ) ( 4,899 ) Long-term debt, net $ 95,042   $ 107,183   (1)
The unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan is presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the corresponding debt balance on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the PNC Credit Facility are presented within other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. On December 27, 2018, the Company entered into a senior secured term loan (the "Senior Secured Term Loan”) and amended its existing PNC Bank Credit Facility Agreement (the "PNC Credit Facility"). On February 11, 2021, the Company prepaid $ 92.3  million of its outstanding Senior Secured Term Loan.
On August 5, 2021, the Company entered into a new senior secured term loan to borrow an aggregate of $ 100.0  million (the “Term Loan”). A portion of the proceeds were used to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan. Borrowings under the Term Loan mature on August 5, 2026. Principal is payable at a rate per annum equal to (a)
2.5 % of the original principal balance thereof during the first year following the closing date of the Term Loan and (b)
5 % of the original principal balance thereof thereafter. Principal and interest payments are payable on a quarterly basis.
On April 25, 2022, the Company entered into amendments to the Term Loan and the PNC Credit Facility. The Term Loan amendment, among other things, (a) amended the total net leverage ratio financial covenant and the minimum liquidity financial covenant commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022; and; (b) replaced the benchmark rate for LIBOR Rate Loans with a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). The amendment to the Term Loan was accounted for as a modification. The Company incurred $ 0.4  million in costs related to the modification which are reflected as a reduction to the carrying amount of the Term Loan and amortized to interest expense over the remaining loan term.
Loans under the Term Loan designated as ABR Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i)
1.75 %; (ii) the Federal funds rate plus
0.50 %; (iii) the SOFR Rate based upon an interest period of one month plus
1.0 %; and (iv) the “Prime Rate” last quoted by the Wall Street Journal, plus an applicable margin of
5.00 %. Loans designated as SOFR Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the SOFR Rate plus an applicable margin of
6.00 %. The SOFR Rate is subject to a floor of
0.75 %. The Company can designate a loan as an ABR Rate Loan or SOFR Rate Loan in its discretion. 10 Table of Contents The PNC Credit Facility amendment, among other things, (a) increased the principal amount of revolving commitments from $ 30.0  million to $ 40.0  million; (b) waived compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant until the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025; (c) amended the total net leverage ratio financial covenant and the minimum liquidity financial covenant commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022; and (d) replaced the benchmark rate for PNC LIBOR Rate Loans with a rate based on SOFR. The amendment to the PNC Credit Facility was accounted for as a modification. The Company incurred $ 0.4  million in costs which were recorded to other assets and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the agreement.
Loans designated as PNC SOFR Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the SOFR Rate plus
2.75 % until December 31, 2023 and thereafter between
2.25 % and
2.75 % determined based on the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio, (as defined in the PNC Credit Facility Agreement) for the most recently completed fiscal quarter (the "PNC SOFR Loan Interest Rate"). Loans under the PNC Credit Facility designated as PNC Domestic Rate Loans and Swing Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the base commercial lending rate of PNC Bank; (ii) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate plus
0.5 %; and (iii) the daily SOFR Rate plus
1.0 %, plus
1.75 % until December 31, 2023 and thereafter between
1.25 % and
1.75 % determined based on the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio (the “PNC Domestic Loan Interest Rate”).
With respect to any PNC SOFR Rate Loan, the Company has agreed to pay affiliates of certain Term Loan lenders a fee equal to a percentage per annum equal to the sum of (x)
6.50 %, minus (y) the PNC SOFR Loan Interest Rate, plus (z) if the SOFR Rate applicable to such interest payment is less than
0.75 %, (i)
0.75 % minus (ii) such SOFR Rate. With respect to any Domestic Rate Loan or Swing Loan, the Company has agreed to pay an affiliate of certain Term Loan lenders a fee equal to a percentage per annum equal to the sum of (x)
5.50 %, minus (y) the PNC Domestic Loan Interest Rate, plus (z) if the Alternative Base Rate applicable to such interest payment is less than
1.00 %, (i)
1.00 % minus (ii) such Alternative Base Rate.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $ 1.4  million related to a $ 20.0  million prepayment of the Term Loan which was comprised of a $ 0.4  million prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 1.0  million. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate on the Term Loan was
9.81 % and the interest rate on the PNC Credit Facility for Domestic Rate Loans and Swing Loans was
9.25 %.
As of December 31, 2022, the PNC Credit Facility had an available borrowing base of $ 33.4  million, of which $ 5.7  million was available to borrow at that date.

NOTE 6:
COMMON STOCK In the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved an increase in its authorized shares of common stock from
125  million to
225  million. On December 30, 2022 the Leadership and Compensation Committee of the Board approved an amendment to the 2021 Inducement Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock of the Company authorized for issuance thereunder from
770,000
to
1.5  million. Common Stock Rights Offering On April 22, 2022, the Company completed a rights offering of
30  million shares of its common stock for $ 2.25
per share (the “Rights Offering”). The proceeds net of offering expenses was $ 66.0  million. A portion of the proceeds from the Rights Offering was used to prepay $ 20.0  million of the Company’s Term Loan. Warrants As of the date of the Rights Offering, the Company had outstanding warrants to purchase
7,110,616
shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $ 1.33
per share and outstanding warrants to purchase
3,400,000
shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.00
per share (the “$ 3.00
Warrants"). The exercise price and the number of shares underlying these warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of specified events, including dilutive issuances of common stock linked equity instruments at a price lower than the exercise price of the warrants, a subdivision or combination of the Company’s common stock, a reclassification of the Company’s common stock or specified dividend payments (the “Down Round Feature”).
On April 22, 2022, the Down Round Feature was triggered for the $ 3.00
Warrants due to the price per share received in the Rights Offering. The exercise price for the $ 3.00
Warrants was adjusted to $ 2.79
per share and an additional
256,113
warrants were subsequently issued with an exercise price of $ 2.79 . The Company calculated the difference between the $ 3.00
Warrants’ fair value before and after the Down Round Feature was triggered using the original exercise price and the new exercise price in addition to the value of the newly issued warrants. The
12 Table of Contents difference in fair value of the effect of the Down Round Feature of $ 0.4  million was reflected as a deemed dividend and a reduction to income available to common stockholders in the basic earnings per share calculation. The Company used the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of the deemed dividend. The assumptions used in the model are as follows: dividend rate of
0 %; expected term of
8
years; volatility of
56 %; and a risk-free rate
2.85 %. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately
10.8  million warrants outstanding. NOTE 7:
NET LOSS PER SHARE The following outstanding stock-based instruments which are comprised of performance share units, restricted stock units, and warrants were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 5,450   8,802   3,763   9,811   The dilutive impact related to common stock from restricted stock units and warrants is determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and the exercise of outstanding warrants. The dilutive impact related to common stock from contingently issuable performance share units is determined by applying a two-step approach using both the contingently issuable share guidance and the treasury stock method. NOTE 8:
INCOME TAXES
The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was ( 7.1 )% and ( 6.7 )%, respectively, as compared to ( 12.6 )% and ( 7.3 )%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 21% during each of these periods due primarily to unbenefited losses experienced in jurisdictions with valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as well as the forecasted mix of earnings in domestic and international jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2022, including interest and penalties, the Company had $ 103.0
million of unrecognized tax benefits, $ 84.3
million of which, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate without consideration of the valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits of $ 1.4
million. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
As of December 31, 2022, $ 95.0
million of unrecognized tax benefits were recorded as a contra deferred tax asset in other long-term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and $ 8.0
million (including interest and penalties) were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that approximately $ 10.8  million of tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties, that are currently unrecognized could be recognized as a result of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Upon recognition of the tax benefit related to the expiring statutes of limitation, $ 10.1  million will be offset by the establishment of a related valuation allowance. The net tax benefit recognized in the statements of operation is estimated to be $ 0.7  million. NOTE 9:
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments to Purchase Inventory 13 Table of Contents The Company uses contract manufacturers for its manufacturing operations. Under these arrangements, the contract manufacturer procures inventory to manufacture products based upon the Company’s forecast of customer demand. The Company has similar arrangements with certain other suppliers. The Company is responsible for the financial impact on the supplier or contract manufacturer of any reduction or product mix shift in the forecast relative to materials that the third party had already purchased under a prior forecast. Such a variance in forecasted demand could require a cash payment for inventory in excess of current customer demand or for costs of excess or obsolete inventory. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had issued non-cancelable commitments for $ 36.7  million to purchase inventory from its contract manufacturers and suppliers. Legal Proceedings On July 22, 2016, Realtime Data LLC d/b/a IXO (“Realtime Data”) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging infringement of U.S. Patents Nos. 7,161,506, 7,378,992, 7,415,530, 8,643,513, 9,054,728, and 9,116,908. The lawsuit has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California for further proceedings. Realtime Data asserts that the Company has incorporated Realtime Data’s patented technology into its compression products and services. Realtime Data seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief that the Court deems appropriate. On July 31, 2017, the District Court stayed proceedings in this litigation pending the outcome of Inter Partes Review proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board relating to the Realtime patents. In those proceedings the asserted claims of the ’506 patent, the ’992 patent, and the ’513 patent were found unpatentable. In addition, on July 19, 2019, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware issued a decision finding that all claims of the ’728 patent, the ’530 patent, and the ’908 patent are not eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. § 101 (the “Delaware Action”). On appeal, the Federal Circuit vacated the decision in the Delaware Action and remanded for the Court to “elaborate on its ruling.” The case pending against Quantum in the Northern District of California remains stayed pending the final outcome in the Delaware Action. On May 4, 2021, the Court in the Delaware Action reaffirmed its earlier ruling and granted defendants’ motions to dismiss under Section 101. The Court also granted Realtime Data fourteen days to file amended complaints in the Delaware Action where they sought leave to do so. On May 19, 2021, Realtime Data filed amended complaints including revised bases for claims of infringement of the same patents. On June 29, 2021, defendants in the Delaware Action filed a renewed motion to dismiss under Section 101. Realtime Data filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss on July 13, 2021. On August 23, 2021, the Court again reaffirmed its earlier ruling and granted defendants’ motions to dismiss under Section 101. Realtime Data has appealed that decision to the Federal Circuit. On September 7, 2021, the case against Quantum in the Northern District of California was stayed pending the outcome of Realtime Data’s appeal in the Delaware Action. The Federal Circuit Court has not yet heard oral arguments. Quantum believes the probability that this lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition is remote.
On July 14, 2020, Starboard Value LP, Starboard Value and Opportunity Master Fund Ltd., Starboard Value and Opportunity S LLC, and Starboard Value and Opportunity C LP (collectively, “Starboard”) filed a lawsuit against Quantum Corporation, Quantum’s former CEO and board member Jon Gacek, and former Quantum board member Paul Auvil in the California Superior Court in Santa Clara County alleging that between 2012 and 2014, Starboard purchased shares of Quantum’s common stock, obtained three seats on Quantum’s board of directors and then, in July 2014, entered into an agreement with Quantum whereby Starboard would not seek control of Quantum’s board but would instead support Quantum’s slate of board nominees so long as Quantum met certain performance objectives by the end of fiscal 2015. The lawsuit further alleges that Quantum hid its failure to meet those performance objectives by improperly recognizing revenue in fiscal 2015. The California action was stayed and then dismissed. On April 14, 2021, Starboard filed a new action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, naming as defendants Messrs. Gacek and Auvil and Quantum. The new action largely repeats the allegations of the California action, alleging claims for fraud against all defendants, fraudulent concealment against all defendants, negligent misrepresentation against all defendants, breach of contract against Quantum, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against Quantum, and breach of fiduciary duty against Messrs. Gacek and Auvil.
As of January 12, 2023, all parties signed a settlement agreement amicably resolving both actions.
The litigation will have no material effect on the Company’s financial statements or business operations.
Other Commitments 14 Table of Contents Additionally, from time to time, the Company is a party to various legal proceedings and claims arising from the normal course of business activities. Based on current available information, the Company does not expect that the ultimate outcome of any currently pending unresolved matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position. NOTE 10:
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company’s assets, measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, may consist of money market funds which are included in cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued using quoted market prices (level 1 fair value measurements) at the respective balance sheet dates. No impairment charges were recognized for non-financial assets in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company has no non-financial liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Long-term Debt The Company’s financial liabilities were comprised primarily of long-term debt at December 31, 2022. The Company uses significant other observable market data or assumptions (Level 2 inputs as defined in the accounting guidance) that it believes market participants would use in pricing debt. The carrying value and fair value of the Company’s financial liabilities were primarily comprised of the following as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Term Loan $ 75,917   $ 75,917   $ 98,750   $ 98,750   PNC Credit Facility 27,736   27,736   7,556   7,556   NOTE 12:

Primary storage systems increased $0.2 million, or 1%, remaining relatively flat to the same period in 2021. Secondary storage systems increased $20.1 million, or 66%, driven by higher demand in hyperscale use cases.
Service revenue We offer a broad range of services including product maintenance, implementation, and training as well as software subscriptions. Service revenue is primarily comprised of customer field support contracts which provide standard support services for our hardware. Standard service contracts may be extended or include enhanced service, such as faster service response times.
Service and subscription revenue decreased 1% in the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, partially driven by lower overall legacy service revenues offset by higher subscription revenue.
Royalty revenue
We receive royalties from third parties that license our LTO media patents through our membership in the LTO consortium. Royalty revenue decreased $0.8 million, or 23%, in the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due to decreased market volume of older generation LTO media.

Product gross margin decreased to 22.4% or by 50 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the same period in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a less favorable mix of revenues, weighted towards our lower margin product lines.
Service and Subscription Gross Margin
Service and subscription gross margins increased 770 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily driven by lower overhead costs across our support and repair functions.

This decrease was primarily driven by cost reduction measures to consolidate acquired businesses.
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.4 million, or 2%, as compared with the same period in 2021. Marketing program expense decreased slightly as we shifted investment to earlier in the year.
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 4%, as compared with the same period in 2021. This increase was largely driven by project cost in our facilities and IT organizations.
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, restructuring expenses decreased $0.6 million as compared with the same period in 2021.
The decrease was the result of cost reduction initiatives in the prior year.

Due to our history of net losses in the United States, the protracted period for utilizing tax attributes in certain foreign jurisdictions, and the difficulty in predicting future results, we believe that we cannot rely on projections of future taxable income to realize most of our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have established a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets. Significant management judgement is required in assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our net deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent that sufficient positive evidence materializes to support a reversal of, or decrease in, our valuation allowance. 19 Table of Contents Comparison of the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021

Primary storage systems decreased $2.4 million, or 6%, primarily driven from a reduced number of large purchases from install base customers. Secondary storage systems increased $42.8 million, or 50%, driven by higher demand in hyperscale use cases.
Service revenue We offer a broad range of services including product maintenance, implementation, and training as well as software subscriptions. Service revenue is primarily comprised of customer field support contracts which provide standard support services for our hardware. Standard service contracts may be extended or include enhanced service, such as faster service response times.
Service and subscription revenue decreased 1% in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 partially driven by lower overall legacy service revenues offset by higher subscription revenue.
Royalty revenue
We receive royalties from third parties that license our LTO media patents through our membership in the LTO consortium. Royalty revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 19%, in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due to decreased market volume of older generation LTO media.
Gross Profit and Margin Nine Months Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 Gross margin % 2021 Gross margin % $ Change Basis point change Product

Product gross margin decreased to 17.9% or by 650 basis points for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the same period in 2021. This decrease was due primarily to a $6.9 million extraordinary inventory reserve provision recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Due to longer purchasing lead times and other factors caused by the global supply chain disruptions occurring since the beginning of the COVID-19
20 Table of Contents pandemic, certain inventory has become obsolete due to next generation products being released and legacy products being discontinued. In addition, following our integration of several past acquisitions, certain legacy products were discontinued and replaced with updated product offerings rendering the related inventory obsolete. We do not believe that the magnitude of this inventory provision is indicative of our ongoing operations and is not expected to be repeated in the near term. Excluding this non-recurring adjustment, product gross margin has declined approximately 300 basis points for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a less favorable mix of revenues weighted towards our lower margin product lines of business and a reduction in royalty partially offset by improvements in pricing and lower supply chain costs.
Service and Subscription Gross Margin
Service and subscription gross margins decreased 100 basis points for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the same period in 2021. This was partially driven by lower overall service revenues, and by cost pressures as a result of certain constraints in the global supply chain. Royalty Gross Margin
Royalties do not have significant related cost of sales.

This decrease was primarily driven by cost reduction measures to consolidate acquired businesses. In the nine months ended December 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses increased $1.8 million, or 4%, as compared with the same period in 2021.
Both marketing expense and travel expense have increased over the prior year as COVID-19 restrictions ease.
In the nine months ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million, or 4%, as compared with the same period in 2021.
This increase was largely driven by increased intangible amortization from business acquisitions.
In the nine months ended December 31, 2022, restructuring expenses increased $0.8 million, or 89%, as compared with the same period in 2021.
The increase was the result of cost reduction initiatives.

Our principal sources of liquidity include cash from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, and amounts available under our PNC Credit Facility. We require significant cash resources to meet obligations to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt, provide for our research and development activities, fund our working capital needs, and make capital expenditures. Our future liquidity requirements will depend on multiple factors, including our research and development plans and capital asset needs. We are subject to the risks arising from COVID-19 and substantial financial market volatility which have adversely affected both the U.S. and the global economy. We have experienced negative impacts on sales due to global supply chain constraints, inflationary concerns and overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment which has resulted in a significant increase in our sales backlog compared to our historical levels. The extent of the impacts depends, in part, on how long the negative trends in customer demand and supply chain levels continue. We expect the impact of COVID-19 and market instability to continue to have a significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources. We had cash and cash equivalents of $26.0 million as of December 31, 2022, which consisted primarily of bank deposits and money market accounts. As of December 31, 2022 we had $5.7 million available to borrow under the PNC Credit Facility. We are subject to various debt covenants under our debt agreements including a net leverage covenant and a
minimum liquidity covenant. Our failure to comply with our debt covenants could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to service our obligations. On April 25, 2022, we amended the covenant levels for our financial covenants under our term debt and PNC Credit Facility. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For additional information about our debt, see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated.     Nine Months Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Cash provided by (used in):    Operating activities $ (19,596) $ (26,681)    Investing activities (12,644) (11,779)    Financing activities 52,973  9,646     Effect of exchange rate changes 21  12  Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 20,754  $ (28,802) Cash Used In Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $19.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This use of cash was primarily attributed to cash used due related to manufacturing and service part inventories of $12.0 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $14.4 million offset by an increase $7.2 million in accounts payable.
Net cash used in operating activities was $26.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This use of cash was primarily attributable to changes in working capital of $24.3 million driven by increases in manufacturing and service part inventories of $13.0 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $8.6 million and a net change in other assets and liabilities of $12.2 million which includes an increase in prepaid inventory of approximately $5.5 million in order to secure manufacturing materials. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $7.0 million and a $5.4 million increase in accounts payable.
Cash Used in Investing Activities 23 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $12.6 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of $10.6 million and a $2.0 million deferred business acquisition payment. Net cash used in investing activities was $11.8 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily attributable to cash paid for our acquisition of our video surveillance business of $7.8 million and capital expenditures of $4.0 million. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $53.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which was related primarily to $66.7 million of net cash received from the Rights Offering of 30 million shares of our common stock and borrowings on our credit facility of $9.6 million offset by a $20.0 million prepayment of our term debt and term debt principal amortization payments and amendment fees totaling $3.3 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $9.6 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2021, which was related primarily to borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from the new Term Loan offset by the repayment in full of the Senior Secured Term Loan. Commitments and Contingencies Our contingent liabilities consist primarily of certain financial guarantees, both express and implied, related to product liability and potential infringement of intellectual property. We have little history of costs associated with such indemnification requirements and contingent liabilities associated with product liability may be mitigated by our insurance coverage. In the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of our services and products, we indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters, such as intellectual property infringement or other claims. We also have indemnification agreements with our current and former officers and directors. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of our indemnification claims, and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. We are also subject to ordinary course litigation. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Except for the indemnification commitments described under “—Commitments and Contingencies” above, we do not currently have any other off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities. Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations and commercial commitments, some of which, such as purchase obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our financial statements. There have not been any other material changes to the contractual obligations disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We consider certain accounting policies to be critical to understanding our financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management, which could have a material impact on our financial statements if actual performance should differ from historical experience or if our assumptions were to change. Our accounting policies that include estimates that require management’s subjective or complex judgments about the
24 Table of Contents effects of matters that are inherently uncertain are summarized in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 under the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies.” For additional information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from those described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which such section is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level described below. Changes in Internal Control In connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See
