(unaudited) NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
–
The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared by the Company, without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for all periods presented, have been made.
"H&R Block," "the Company," "we," "our," and "us" are used interchangeably to refer to H&R Block, Inc., to H&R Block, Inc. and its subsidiaries, or to H&R Block, Inc.'s operating subsidiaries, as appropriate to the context.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our June 30, 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K. All amounts presented herein as of June 30, 2022 or for the year then ended are derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
–
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates, assumptions and judgments are applied in the evaluation of contingent losses arising from our discontinued mortgage business, contingent losses associated with pending claims and litigation, reserves for uncertain tax positions, fair value of reporting units, and related matters. Estimates have been prepared based on the best information available as of each balance sheet date. As such, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS
– Our operating revenues are seasonal in nature with peak revenues typically occurring in the months of February through April. Therefore, results for interim periods are not indicative of results to be expected for the full year. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  –  Our discontinued operations include the results of operations of Sand Canyon Corporation, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation (including its subsidiaries, collectively, SCC), which exited its mortgage business in fiscal year 2008. See
note 9
for additional information on loss contingencies related to our discontinued operations. 6 Q2 FY2023 Form 10-Q|

2023 . NOTE 3: EARNINGS PER SHARE AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
EARNINGS PER SHARE
– Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines net income per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Per share amounts are computed by dividing net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of shares of common stock issuable upon the lapse of certain restrictions or the exercise of options to purchase
4.5  million shares for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and
5.1
million shares for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021,
as the effect would be antidilutive due to the net loss from continuing operations during the periods. H&R Block, Inc.

billion, which includes a $ 175.0
million sublimit for swingline loans and a $ 50.0
million sublimit for standby letters of credit. We may request increases in the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility of up to $ 500.0

The CLOC will mature on June 11, 2026, unless extended pursuant to the terms of the CLOC, at which time all outstanding amounts thereunder will be due and payable. Our CLOC includes an annual facility fee, which will vary depending on our then current credit ratings. The CLOC is subject to various conditions, triggers, events or occurrences that could result in earlier termination and contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including, without limitation: (1) a covenant requiring the Company to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by the CLOC agreement, calculated on a consolidated basis of no greater than (a)
3.50
to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on March 31, June 30, and September 30 of each year and (b)

2.50
to 1.00 as of the last date of any fiscal quarter; and (3) covenants restricting our ability to incur certain additional debt, incur liens, merge or consolidate with other companies, sell or dispose of assets (including equity interests), liquidate or dissolve, engage in certain transactions with affiliates or enter into certain restrictive agreements. The CLOC

million under our CLOC and amounts available to borrow were not limited by the debt-to-EBITDA covenant as of December 31, 2022.
NOTE 7: INCOME TAXES We file a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S. with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and file tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax returns are typically examined and either settled upon completion of the examination or through the appeals process. With respect to federal, state and local jurisdictions and countries outside of the U.S., we are typically subject to examination for three to six years after the income tax returns have been filed. On November 7, 2022, the IRS commenced their examination of our 2020 tax return and related carryback claims to tax years 2015 through 2018. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that adequate amounts of tax, interest, and penalties have been provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might be incurred due to federal, state, local or foreign audits. We had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 221.3
million and $ 232.0  million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 10.7  million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 due to expiration of statutes and settlements with state tax authorities. We believe it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $ 34.0
million within the next twelve months. The anticipated decrease is due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and anticipated closure of various matters currently under examination or in appeals. For such matters where a change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits is not yet deemed reasonably possible, no estimate has been included.
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations, including the effects of discrete tax items, was
25.2 % and
31.7 % for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Discrete items increased the effective tax rate by
1.4 % and
10.1 % for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. A discrete income tax benefit of $ 7.2  million and $ 50.0  million were recorded in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The discrete tax benefit recorded in the current period primarily resulted from state statute of limitations expirations and refund interest. The discrete tax benefit recorded in the prior period primarily resulted from federal and state statute of limitations expirations. Consistent with prior years, our pretax loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022 is expected to be offset by income in our third and fourth quarters due to the established pattern of seasonality in our primary business operations. As such, management has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that realization of tax benefits recorded in our financial statements will occur within our fiscal year. The amount of tax benefit recorded for the six months ended December 31, 2022 reflects management’s estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date loss from continuing operations adjusted for the tax impact of discrete items for the periods presented.

are covered by our 100% accuracy guarantee, whereby we will reimburse a client for penalties and interest attributable to an H&R Block error on a return. DIY tax returns are covered by our 100% accuracy guarantee, whereby we will reimburse a client up to a maximum of $ 10,000
if our software makes an arithmetic error that results in payment of penalties and/or interest to the IRS that a client would otherwise not have been required to pay. Our liability related to estimated losses under the 100% accuracy guarantee was $ 11.7
million and $ 14.0
million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The short-term and long-term portions of this liability are included in deferred revenue and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Liabilities related to acquisitions for (1) estimated contingent consideration based on expected financial performance of the acquired business and economic conditions at the time of acquisition and (2) estimated accrued compensation related to continued employment of key employees were $ 21.4

We have contractual commitments to fund certain franchises with approved revolving lines of credit. Our total obligation under these lines of credit was $ 21.1
million at December 31, 2022, and net of amounts drawn and outstanding, our remaining commitment to fund totaled $ 7.4
million. In March 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to provide economic and other relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes, among other items, provisions relating to refundable employee retention payroll tax credits.
Due to the complex nature of the employee retention credit computations, any benefits we may receive are uncertain and may significantly differ from our current estimates. We plan to record any benefit related to these credits upon both the receipt of the benefit and the resolution of the uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the completion of any potential audit or examination, or the expiration of the related stat ute of limitations. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we received $ 12.1  million related to these credits and recognized $ 3.2  million as an offset to related operating expenses. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had deferre d balances of $ 13.9  million and $ 5.1  million, respectively, which is recorded in deferred revenue and other current liabilities.

We are a defendant in numerous litigation and arbitration matters, arising both in the ordinary course of business and otherwise, including as described below. The matters described below are not all of the lawsuits or arbitrations to which we are subject. In some of the matters, very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive damages, may be sought. U.S. jurisdictions permit considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction. In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters. We believe that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value due to this variability in pleadings and our experience in handling and resolving numerous claims over an extended period of time. The outcome of a matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may be difficult to ascertain. Among other things, uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how courts and arbitrators will apply the law. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will view the relevant evidence and applicable law. In addition to litigation and arbitration matters, we are also subject to other loss contingencies arising out of our business activities, including as described below. We accrue liabilities for litigation, arbitration, and other related loss contingencies and any related settlements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a range of loss is estimated, and some amount within that range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within that range, then that amount is accrued. If no amount within the range can be identified as a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the minimum amount in the range. For such matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, or the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual has been made. It is possible that such matters could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or accrue liabilities in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated as of December 31, 2022. While the potential future liabilities could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known, we do not believe any such liabilities are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of
H&R Block, Inc.
|Q2 FY2023 Form 10-Q 13 Table of Contents operations, and cash flows. Our total accrued liabilities were $ 1.6  million and $ 1.7  million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Our estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1) matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability, and (2) matters where a liability has not been accrued but we believe a loss is reasonably possible. This aggregate range only represents those losses as to which we are currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss. It does not represent our maximum loss exposure. Matters for which we are not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss are not included in this range. We are often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, such as precise information about the amount of damages or other remedies being asserted, the defenses to the claims being asserted, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by courts or arbitrators on motions or appeals, analyses by experts, or the status or terms of any settlement negotiations. The estimated range of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, as well as known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. As of December 31, 2022, we believe the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued, where the range of loss can be estimated, is not material. At the end of each reporting period, we review relevant information with respect to litigation, arbitration and other related loss contingencies and update our accruals, disclosures, and estimates of reasonably possible loss or range of loss based on such reviews. Costs incurred with defending matters are expensed as incurred. Any receivable for insurance recoveries is recorded separately from the corresponding liability, and only if recovery is determined to be probable and reasonably estimable. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in the various matters described in this note, and we intend to defend them vigorously. The amounts claimed in the matters are substantial, however, and there can be no assurances as to their outcomes. In the event of unfavorable outcomes, it could require modifications to our operations; in addition, the amounts that may be required to be paid to discharge or settle the matters could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. LITIGATION, CLAIMS OR OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES PERTAINING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS
– Free File Litigation.
On May 6, 2019, the Los Angeles City Attorney filed a lawsuit on behalf of the People of the State of California in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (Case No. 19STCV15742). The case is styled
The People of the State of California v. HRB Digital LLC, et al . The complaint alleges that H&R Block, Inc. and HRB Digital LLC engaged in unfair, fraudulent and deceptive business practices and acts in connection with the IRS Free File Program in violation of the California Unfair Competition Law, California Business and Professions Code §§17200
et seq.
The complaint seeks injunctive relief, restitution of monies paid to H&R Block by persons in the State of California who were eligible to file under the IRS Free File Program for the time period starting
4
years prior to the date of the filing of the complaint, pre-judgment interest, civil penalties and costs. The City Attorney subsequently dismissed H&R Block, Inc. from the case and amended its complaint to add HRB Tax Group, Inc. We filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied on December 1, 2022. A trial date is set for August 14, 2023. We have not concluded that a loss related to this matter is probable, nor have we accrued a liability related to this matter. We have also received and are responding to certain governmental inquiries relating to the IRS Free File Program.
DISCONTINUED MORTGAGE OPERATIONS  – Although SCC ceased its mortgage loan origination activities in December 2007 and sold its loan servicing business in April 2008, SCC or the Company has been and may in the future be, subject to litigation and other loss contingencies, including indemnification and contribution claims, pertaining to SCC's mortgage business activities that occurred prior to such termination and sale.
14 Q2 FY2023 Form 10-Q|
H&R Block, Inc. Table of Contents Parties, including underwriters, depositors, and securitization trustees, have been, remain, or may in the future be, involved in lawsuits, threatened lawsuits, or settlements related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated. A variety of claims are alleged in these matters, including violations of federal and state securities laws and common law fraud, breaches of representations and warranties, or violations of statutory requirements. SCC has received notices of potential indemnification or contribution obligations relating to such matters. Additional lawsuits against the parties to the securitization transactions may be filed in the future, and SCC may receive additional notices of potential indemnification, contribution or similar obligations with respect to existing or new lawsuits or settlements of such lawsuits or other claims. An accrual related to these matters is included in our loss contingency accrual. It is difficult to predict either the likelihood of new matters being initiated or the outcome of existing matters. In many of these matters it is not possible to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters and the indeterminate damages sought. If the amount that SCC is ultimately required to pay with respect to loss contingencies, together with payment of SCC's related administration and legal expense, exceeds SCC's net assets, the creditors of SCC, other potential claimants, or a bankruptcy trustee if SCC were to file or be forced into bankruptcy, may attempt to assert claims against us for payment of SCC's obligations. Claimants also may attempt to assert claims against or seek payment directly from the Company even if SCC's assets exceed its liabilities. SCC's principal assets, as of December 31, 2022, total approximately $ 267  million and consist of an intercompany note receivable. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments; however, if this position is challenged and not upheld, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. OTHER
– We are from time to time a party to litigation, arbitration and other loss contingencies not discussed herein arising out of our business operations. These matters may include actions by state attorneys general, other state regulators, federal regulators, individual plaintiffs, and cases in which plaintiffs seek to represent others who may be similarly situated.
While we cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately prevail in each instance, we believe the amount, if any, we are required to pay to discharge or settle these other matters will not have a material adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

FINANCIAL CONDITION These comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in
Part 1, Item 1 . CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
–
OVERVIEW
– Our primary sources of capital and liquidity include cash from operations (including changes in working capital), draws on our CLOC, and issuances of debt. We use our sources of liquidity primarily to fund working capital, service and repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, and acquire businesses.
H&R Block, Inc.
|Q2 FY2023 Form 10-Q 19 Table of Contents Our operations are highly seasonal and substantially all of our revenues and cash flow are generated during the period from February through April in a typical year. Therefore, we normally require the use of cash to fund losses and working capital needs, periodically resulting in a working capital deficit, during the months of May through January. We typically have relied on available cash balances from the prior tax season and borrowings to meet liquidity needs. Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options discussed herein, we believe that, in the absence of any unexpected developments, our existing sources of capital as of December 31, 2022 are sufficient to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. DISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
– The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See
Item 1
for the complete consolidated statements of cash flows for these periods. (in 000s) Six months ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ (780,458) $ (913,571) Investing activities (99,090) (57,444) Financing activities 128,813   (149,883) Effects of exchange rates on cash (7,790) (3,330) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted balances $ (758,525) $ (1,124,228) Operating Activities.
Cash used in operations totaled $780.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $913.6 million in the prior year period. The change is primarily due to the receipt of income tax receivables in the current year, partially offset by an increase in our net loss in the current year. Investing Activities.
Cash used in investing activities totaled $99.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $57.4 million in the prior year period. The change is primarily due to payments to acquire businesses in the current year. Financing Activities.
Cash provided by financing activities totaled $128.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to cash used in financing activities of $149.9 million in the prior year period. The change is primarily due to higher draws on our CLOC in the current year. CASH REQUIREMENTS
– Dividends and Share Repurchases.
Returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of outstanding shares is, and has historically been, a significant component of our capital allocation plan. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled
$89.2 million
and
$96.9 million
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Although we have historically paid dividends and plan to continue to do so, there can be no assurances that circumstances will not change in the future that could affect our ability or decisions to pay dividends. In August 2022, the Board of Directors approved a $1.25 billion share repurchase program, effective through fiscal year 2025. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased $350.1 million of our common stock at an average price of $42.86 per share. In the prior year period, we repurchased $324.6 million of our common stock at an average price of $24.24 per share. Our current share repurchase program has remaining authorization of $900.0 million, which is effective through June 2025. Share repurchases may be effectuated through open market transactions, some of which may be effectuated under SEC Rule 10b5-1. The Company may cancel, suspend, or extend the period for the purchase of shares at any time. Any repurchases will be funded primarily through available cash and cash from operations. Although we may continue to repurchase shares, there is no assurance that we will purchase up to the full Board authorization.     Capital Investment.
Capital expenditures totaled $41.5 million and $39.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to recurring improvements to
20 Q2 FY2023 Form 10-Q|
H&R Block, Inc. Table of Contents retail offices, as well as investments in computers, software and related assets. In addition to our capital expenditures, we also made payments to acquire businesses. We acquired franchisee and competitor businesses totaling $39.8 million and $19.3 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See
Item 1, note 5
for additional information on our acquisitions.
FINANCING RESOURCES
– The CLOC has capacity up to $1.5 billion and is scheduled to expire in June 2026. Proceeds under the CLOC may be used for working capital needs or for other general corporate purposes. We had an outstanding balance of $580.0 million under our CLOC as of December 31, 2022. Amounts available to borrow were not limited by the debt-to-EBITDA covenant as of December 31, 2022.
The following table provides ratings for debt issued by Block Financial LLC (Block Financial) as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: As of December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Short-term Long-term Outlook Short-term Long-term Outlook Moody's P-3 Baa3 Positive P-3 Baa3 Stable S&P A-2 BBB Stable A-2 BBB Stable Other than described above, there have been no material changes in our borrowings from those reported as of June 30, 2022 in our Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K. CASH AND OTHER ASSETS
– As of December 31, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted amounts, of $264.5 million, including $113.7 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. Foreign Operations.
Seasonal borrowing needs of our Canadian operations are typically funded by our U.S. operations. To mitigate foreign currency risk, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange forward contracts. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
We do not currently intend to repatriate non-borrowed funds held by our foreign subsidiaries in a manner that would trigger a material tax liability. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates during the period on our international cash balances resulted in a decrease of $7.8 million and $3.3 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS
– Emerald Advance SM
lines of credit (EAs) are originated by Pathward TM
N.A. (Pathward). We purchase a 90% participation interest, at par, in all EAs originated by Pathward in accordance with our participation agreement. At December 31, 2022, the principal balance of purchased participation interests totaled $270.4 million. There have been no other material changes in our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those reported in our June 30, 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K. SUMMARIZED GUARANTOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT As previously disclosed, in 2017 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) published its final rule regulating certain consumer credit products (Payday Rule), which the CFPB later limited by removing the mandatory underwriting provisions. Certain limited provisions of the Payday Rule became effective in 2018, but most provisions were scheduled to go into effect in 2019. Litigation in a federal district court in Texas had stayed that effective date, but on August 31, 2021 the judge in that litigation ruled in favor of the CFPB. The plaintiffs appealed, and, on October 14, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit extended the compliance deadline until after the appeal is resolved. On October 19, 2022, the appellate court found that the funding mechanism for the CFPB was unconstitutional and vacated the Payday Rule. On November 14, 2022, the CFPB filed a petition for review with the United States Supreme Court. We are unsure whether, when, or in what form the Payday Rule will go into effect. Though we do not currently expect the Payday Rule to have a material adverse impact on Emerald Advance SM , our business, or our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, we will continue to monitor and analyze the potential impact of any further developments on the Company. There have been no other material changes in our regulatory environment from what was reported in our June 30, 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because these measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures for other companies. We consider our non-GAAP financial measures to be performance measures and a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business. We make adjustments for certain non-GAAP financial measures related to amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and goodwill impairments. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. We measure the performance of our business using a variety of metrics, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, free cash flow and free cash flow yield.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report and other documents filed with the SEC may contain forward-looking statements. In addition, our senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words or variation of words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "commits," "seeks," "estimates," "projects," "forecasts," "targets," "would," "will," "should," "goal," "could," "may" or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements provide management's current expectations or predictions of future conditions, events or results. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements. They may include estimates of revenues, client trajectory, income, effective tax rate, earnings per share, cost savings, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, liquidity, capital structure, market share, industry volumes or other financial items, descriptions of management's plans or objectives for future operations, services or products, or descriptions of assumptions underlying any of the above. They may also include the expected impact of the coronavirus (COVID–19) pandemic, including, without limitation, the impact on economic

|Q2 FY2023 Form 10-Q 23 Table of Contents and financial markets, the Company's capital resources and financial condition, future expenditures, potential regulatory actions, such as extensions of tax filing deadlines or other related relief, changes in consumer behaviors and modifications to the Company's operations relating thereto. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and reflect the Company's good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, but they are not guarantees of future performance or events. Furthermore, the Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, or expectations, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes, except as required by law. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, a variety of economic, competitive, operational and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition, factors that may cause the Company’s actual effective tax rate to differ from estimates include the Company’s actual results from operations compared to current estimates, future discrete items, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, future actions of the Company, and increases in applicable tax rates in jurisdictions where the Company operates. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, consequently, should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Details about risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect various aspects of our business are included throughout our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and are also described from time to time in other filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider all of these risks, and should pay particular attention to Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Item 7 under "Critical Accounting Policies" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
