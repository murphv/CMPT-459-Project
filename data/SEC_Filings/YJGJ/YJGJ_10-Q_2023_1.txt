NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2023
(UNAUDITED)
Note 1 –
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(“GAAP”), and the instructions to Form –Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures
normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information
not misleading.
In the opinion of management, the consolidated
balance sheet as of April 30, 2022 which has been derived from audited financial statements and these unaudited condensed financial statements
reflect all normal and considered necessary to state fairly the results for the periods presented. The results for the period ended January
31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending April 30, 2023 or for any future
period.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management’s Discussion and the audited financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022.
Note 2 –
ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF
BUSINESS
Yijia Group Corp. (“the Company”,
“we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated as Soldino Group Corp. on January 25, 2017 under the laws of
the State of Nevada, United States of America. On November 15, 2018, the Company changed its name to Yijia Group Corp.
The Company currently engages in the rendering
of business consulting service to domestic and international customers.
Note 3 –
GOING CONCERN
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company
as a going concern. The Company suffered from a working capital deficit of $ 54,830
and an accumulated deficit of $ 119,525 .
Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern without future profitability. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent,
in the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will
be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets.
In light of management’s efforts, there
are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going
concern. The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

(UNAUDITED)
Note 4 –
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the unaudited condensed financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost
and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update
("ASU") No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”) using the full retrospective
transition method. The Company's adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized
in its condensed financial statements.
Under ASU 2014-09, the Company recognizes revenue
when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company applies the following five steps in
order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:
•
identify the contract with a customer;
•
identify the performance obligations in the contract;
•
determine the transaction price;
•
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
•
recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Consulting income is recognized, when the service
is rendered and billed to the customer on a monthly basis, pursuant to the fulfillment of service terms in the agreement.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed using the asset and
liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
Uncertain tax positions
The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions
and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the ASC 740 provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the nine
months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.
Net (Loss) Income Per Share
The Company computes net income per share in accordance
with FASB ASC 260 “Earnings per Share”. Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income per share gives effect to all dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive income per share excludes
all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, there were
no
potentially dilutive debt
or equity instruments issued or outstanding.

Note 4 –
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (continued)
Currencies
The Company’s reporting and functional currencies
are both the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense) but are negligible.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is defined as all changes
in stockholders’ deficit, exclusive of transactions with owners, such as capital investments. Comprehensive income includes net
income or loss, changes in certain assets and liabilities that are reported directly in equity such as translation adjustments on investments
in foreign subsidiaries and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, there
were no differences between our comprehensive income and net income.
Related parties
Parties, which can be a corporation or individual,
are considered to be related if the entities have the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant
influence over the party in making financial and operational decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject
to common control or common significant influence.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”)
topic 820 " Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures " establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes
the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in
measuring fair value are observable in the market.
These tiers include:
Level 1:
defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2:
defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable;
Level 3:
defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The carrying value of cash and the Company’s
amount due to a related party approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to
cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
Note 5 –
AMOUNT DUE TO A RELATED PARTY
Amount due to a related party represents temporary
advance by the director of the Company. The amount is unsecured, interest-free and repayment on demand.

INCOME TAXES
The Company adopted the provisions of uncertain
tax positions as addressed in ASC 740-10-65-1. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-65-1, the Company recognized no increase
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company has no tax position at January 31,
2023 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
The Company does not recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.
No such interest or penalties were recognized during the period presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at January
31, 2023. The Company’s utilization of any net operating loss carry forward may be unlikely as a result of its intended activities.
The valuation allowance at January 31, 2023 was
$ 6,974 . The net change in valuation allowance during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was $ 4,167 . In assessing the realizability
of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets
will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income
tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of
these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances
to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022. All tax years since inception
remains open for examination only by taxing authorities of US Federal and state of Nevada.
The Company has a net operating loss carryforward
for tax purposes totaling $ 33,209
at January 31, 2023, expiring through 2041. There is a limitation on the amount of taxable income that
can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a 50% change in ownership). Temporary differences, which
give rise to a net deferred tax asset, are as follows:

Item 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our results
of operations and financial condition should be read together with our unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto,
which are included elsewhere in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 (the “Annual
Report”) filed with SEC. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our financial statements
and the financial information included in this report reflect our organizational transactions and have been prepared as if our current
corporate structure had been in place throughout the relevant periods.
Forward looking statement notice
Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not
historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified
by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate,"
"approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to
the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future.
However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.
We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
Financial information contained in this report
and in our financial statements is stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles.
Corporate Overview
The Company was incorporated as Soldino Group
Corp. on January 25, 2017 under the laws of the State of Nevada, United States of America. On November 15, 2018, the Company changed its
name to Yijia Group Corp. The Company is in good standing in the State of Nevada and in any jurisdiction where it is qualified to do business.
The Company currently engages in the rendering
of business consulting service to domestic and international customers. The Company provides consulting services to its clients with regards
to funding and other financial matters.
Results of Operations
We have incurred net current liabilities of $54,830
as at January 31, 2023. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly,
do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should we be unable to continue operations.
We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities.

Liquidity and capital resources
As of January 31, 2023, our total assets were
$11,013, our current liabilities were $65,843 and stockholders’ deficit was $11,013. As of January 31, 2023, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $11,013.
Our cash balance is $11,013 as of January 31,
2023. We believe our cash balance is insufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. Management anticipates that the Company
will be dependent, in the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself
so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts, there are no assurances
that the Company will be successful.

We have never paid dividends on our common stock.
Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently, we do not expect to
pay dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future.

Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company”
under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long
as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s report on the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); submit certain executive compensation
matters to shareholders advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and disclose certain executive
compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation
to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies.
We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest
of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become
a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market
value of our ordinary shares that is held by non- affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three
year period. Even if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth company, we may still be, in certain circumstances,
subject to scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company. For example, smaller reporting companies, like emerging growth
companies, are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K or auditor attestation
of internal controls over financial reporting.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of January 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1)
lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
(2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure
and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
in connection with the review of our financial statements as of January 31, 2023.
Management believes that the material weaknesses
set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a
functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors results in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our
financial statements in future periods.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are aware that any system of controls, however
well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met, and that
maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures is an ongoing process that may change over time.
