(Formerly iMine Corporation) Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   My City Builders, Inc. (the “Company” or “My City Builders”) is a Nevada corporation incorporated on October 26, 2010 under the name Oconn Industries Corp. The Company’s name was changed on March 11, 2014 from Oconn Industries Corp. to Diamante Minerals, Inc., and to iMine Corporation on March 20, 2018 and to My City Builders, Inc on January 31, 2023.
In July 2022, the Company acquired RAC Real Estate Acquisition Corp, a Wyoming Corporation ("RAC"). RAC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company, through RAC, plans to focus on real estate transactions, in which the Company will buy and develop real estate for sale or rent of low-income housing. The Company plans to invest in three sectors of this market by (i) buying, refurbishing and selling traditional foreclosures, (ii) buying, developing and renting “Land Banks” that have an average pool of homes or lots in excess of 100 in one location and (iii) buying, refurbishing or developing and selling homes made available by the government through HECM pools. The Company is currently working with a third-party vendor to facilitate this plan.   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Presentation of Interim Information   The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) for interim financial information and with Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. Notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31,2022 have been omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended July 31,2022 included within the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.   In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the consolidated financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s periodic filings with the SEC include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   For purposes of balance sheet presentation and reporting of cash flows, the Company considers all unrestricted demand deposits, money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of less than 90 days to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at January 31, 2023.   Periodically, the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions more than the federally insured limit of $ 250,000  per institution. The Company has not experienced losses on account balances and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant.     8 Table of Contents   Principles of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of My City Builders and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.   Fair Value Measurements   As defined in ASC 820” Fair  Value Measurements,”  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).   Investments in Equity and Debt   Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.   The Company’s debt securities are primarily invested in a third-party vendor and asset management company, to purchase, develop and manage real estate properties. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of the Company’s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there generally is no known or accessible market or market indexes for debt instruments for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. The Company may, from time to time, invest in public debt of companies that meet the Company’s investment objectives, and to the extent market quotations or other pricing indicators (i.e. broker quotes) are available, these investments are considered Level 1 or 2 assets in line with ASC Topic 820.   Construction in progress   Construction in progress generally involves short-term capital projects and is not depreciated until the development has reached completion and has been put into service.
Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which requires the Company to recognize revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue based on the five criteria for revenue recognition established under Topic 606: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify separate performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price among the performance obligations, and 5) recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.   The Company records interest income on an accrual basis and recognizes it as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement and underlying debt instrument, to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Debt investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or fees will not be collected according to contractual terms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, the Company ceases to recognize interest and fee income until the portfolio company has paid all principal and interest due or demonstrated the ability to repay its current and future contractual obligations to the Company. The Company may not apply the non-accrual status to a loan where the investment has sufficient collateral value to collect all of the contractual amount due and is in the process of collection. Interest collected on non-accrual investments are generally applied to principal.     9 Table of Contents   Net Loss per Share of Common Stock   The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of common stock are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares and potential shares outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of shares to be issued taken into account the effect of dilutive instruments. As of January 31, 2023, there were  100,000  shares of series A preferred stock, that were not included in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   The Company has implemented all new pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or results of operations.   NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the period ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 73,203 . As of January 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 96,441 . In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to raise necessary funding through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ended July 31, 2023. However, until the Company engages in an active business or makes an acquisition the Company is likely to not be able to raise any significant debt or equity financing.   The ability of the Company to begin operations in its new business model is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining financing to commence operations and develop a business plan or making an acquisition. The Company cannot give any assurance as to its ability to develop or acquire a business or to operate profitably.   These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   NOTE 4 – LOAN RECEIVABLE   On July 22, 2022, the Company received a promissory note, in the principal amount of $ 672,960  from, and entered into a Loan Agreement dated July 18, 2022 with, Fix Pads Holdings, LLC.

Consideration for the note was paid in part by the Company in the amount of $ 328,626 , net of prepayment interest and in part by a third-party investor in the amount of $ 328,626 .   On August 18, 2022, the Company issued the promissory note. The note has a 12% interest rate per annum payable of $ 358,620  and is due on August 1, 2023. Consideration for the note was paid in part by the Company in the amount of $ 175,007 , net of prepayment interest and in part by a third-party investor in the amount of $ 175,007 .   During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company collected principal of $ 124,200
and interest of $ 37,872 , of which principal of $ 62,100
and interest of $ 16,796

11 Table of Contents   Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   Overview   In July of 2022 we acquired RAC Real Estate Acquisition Corp, a Wyoming Corporation (RAC). RAC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company, through RAC, plans to focus on real estate transactions, in which we will buy and develop real estate for sale or rent of low-income housing.

The LLC is managed by a manager, Fix Pads Management, LLC.   The Agreement provides that additional capital contributions of the members will be made to the LLC as follows: (i) Fix Pads Holdings, LLC will transfer and assign all rights to and incidents of ownership for up to 60 residential properties it has title, or will have title, to the LLC, as set forth in the Agreement; and (ii) RAC will make additional cash contributions to the capital of the LLC, up to a maximum of $5,214,000, on such dates and in such amounts as requested by the LLC, in the manner set forth in the Agreement.     12 Table of Contents   Under the Agreement RAC will receive the net cost funded per property which currently is estimated at $92,000 per home refurbished along with the cost RAC paid to clear the Fix Pads Holdings title which currently is estimated at $6,900 per home, the value of the properties contributed by Fix Pads Holdings, LLC and the additional cash contributions by RAC. Distributions to the members under the Agreement will be made as follows: (i) from the sale of each property by the LLC, the LLC shall distribute $13,000 of the net sale proceeds to RAC and distribute and additional amount to RAC equal to the average RAC additional cash capital contribution per property, the balance net proceeds will be distributed to Fix Pads Holdings, LLC; (ii) for any property that is leased by the LLC, RAC will have the option to buy such property from the LLC and for any such property that is not bought by RAC, any net rental income will be retained by the LLC and distributed to the members based on (a) further written agreement of the members or (b) if the members are unable to agree then on such terms as provided in the Agreement.   Since the acquisition of RAC, the Company, through our third-party vendor, has financed the clearance of 55 titles in the name of Fix Pads Holdings, LLC and the 17 homes under construction in the LLC and 11 homes under the two promissory notes. Due to current interest rates and construction costs RAC has made the decision to reduce the homes to be remodeled in the LLC to 30 from 55 and move the focus to Land Bank projects where we have a minimum of 100 lots all in one location and will be able to rent all of the properties through qualified renters and Section 8 coupons from the local municipalities. Our first Land Bank project is in Gadsden Alabama with the Gadsden Land Bank Authority which we have purchased from the Land Bank 23 lots to start new construction of low income single family homes. The initial design is a 3 bedroom 1400 square foot home that will be constructed with new state of the art panel designed homes that will significantly reduce the time of construction for these homes to meet our targeted construction schedule of 20 homes every 60 days. We have ordered and have received the first three pre-engineered homes in Gadsden to determine if RAC will construct pre-engineered or traditional “stick built” homes.   On January 31,2023, the Company changed its corporate name to My City Builders, Inc., through the merger of the Company with its wholly owned subsidiary, My City Builders, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Subsidiary”). Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger between the Company and the Subsidiary, the Subsidiary was merged with and into the Company and the Company’s name was changed to My City Builders, Inc. The only change to the Company’s articles of incorporation was the change of the Company’s corporate name. Pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 92A.180, the merger did not require stockholder approval. The change of name will take place in the marketplace upon approval by FINRA.   Results of Operations   Three Months Ended January 31, 2023   For the three months ended January 31, 2023, we generated revenue from interest income of $13,569.

) Cash used in investing activities   $ (2,142,272
) Cash provided by financing activities   $ 2,196,000   Cash on hand   $ 9,553     The cash flow used in operating activities for the six months ended January 31, 2023, reflects our net loss of $73,203. This amount was decreased by amounts due to related parties of $33,780, and accounts payable and accrued interest of $1,278 and increased by deferred interest income of $6,748.    For the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company received cash from loan receivable of $140,996 and used $1,945,200 for investment, $179,310 for loan receivable and $158,758 for payment of construction.     For the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company received advance from related parties of $2,616,000 and repaid $420,000 to related parties.    Going Concern   Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, we incurred net loss of $73,203 and net cash used in operating activities of $44,893. As of January 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $96,441. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management plans to raise necessary funding through equity and debt financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. The ability of the Company to continue operations in its new business model is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining financing to continue operations and continue developing the business plan. The Company cannot give any assurance as to the ability to develop or operate profitably. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.   Critical Accounting Policies   Use of Estimates: The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that directly affect the results of reported assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, including the valuation of non-cash transactions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   As a smaller reporting company, we have elected not to provide the disclosure required by this item.     14 Table of Contents   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (“Disclosure Controls”), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of January 31, 2023, the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, which positions are held by the same person who assumed both positions on August 14, 2019, and who is our only executive officer. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that, due to the inadequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, our sole principal being our chief executive and financial officer and sole director, and our limited internal audit function, our disclosure controls were not effective as of January 31, 2023, such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the president and treasurer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   As reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022, management has determined that our internal controls contain material weaknesses due to the absence of segregation of duties, as well as lack of qualified accounting personnel and excessive reliance on third party consultants for accounting, financial reporting and related activities. The lack of any separation of duties, with the same person, who is our only principal who serves as both chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who is our sole director, and who does not have an accounting background and serves on a part-time basis, makes it unlikely that we will be able to implement effective internal controls over financial reporting in the near future.   During the period ended January 31, 2023, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     15 Table of Contents   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
