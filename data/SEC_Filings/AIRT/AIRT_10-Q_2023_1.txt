AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1.     Financial Statement Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements of Air T, Inc. (“Air T”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the following disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented have been made.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. The results of operations for the period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
Impacts from Geopolitical, Macroeconomic, and COVID-19 Challenges COVID-19 and its impact on the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas present uncertainty and risk with respect to our financial condition and results of operations. Each of our businesses implemented measures to attempt to limit the impact of COVID-19 but we still experienced a number of disruptions, and we experienced and continue to experience to a lesser degree a reduction in demand for commercial aircraft, jet engines and parts compared to historical periods. Although many of the restrictions and other containment measures implemented by authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 will continue to some extent. The fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 on economic and market conditions, and, as a result, present material uncertainty and risk with respect to us and our results of operations. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions underlying the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable and supportable based on the information available as of December 31, 2022; however, uncertainty over the ultimate direct and indirect impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy generally, and the Company’s businesses in particular, makes any estimates and assumptions as of December 31, 2022 inherently less certain than they would be absent the current and potential impacts of COVID-19. The war in Eastern Europe and related sanctions imposed on Russia and related actors and other macroeconomic factors have resulted in interest rate acceleration and in inflation, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in the price of commodities. These factors may negatively impact our businesses at least in the short-term. The ultimate impact on our overall financial condition and operating results will depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of these activities and macroeconomic factors. We continue to evaluate the long-term impact that these may have on our business model, however there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken or will take will completely offset any negative impact.
8 Liquidity
The Contrail Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of Contrail and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee indebtedness, incur liens, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments, make changes in the nature of its business, and engage in transactions with affiliates. The Contrail Credit Agreement also contains quarterly financial covenants applicable to Contrail and its subsidiaries, including a minimum debt service coverage ratio of
1.25
to 1.0 and a minimum tangible net worth of $12.0 million. The Company is in compliance with such financial covenants as of December 31, 2022. However, management is forecasting that the Company will be in violation of the debt service coverage ratio during the twelve-month period subsequent to the date of this filing, primarily because the first principal payment of its Main Street loan ("Term Note G - ONB") becomes due in November 2023. Non-compliance with a debt covenant that is not subsequently cured gives Old National Bank ("ONB") the right to accelerate the maturity of the Contrail Credit Agreement and declare the entire amount of Contrail’s outstanding debt at the time of non-compliance immediately due and payable and exercise its remedies with respect to the collateral that secures the debt. Should ONB accelerate the maturity of the Contrail Credit Agreement, the Company would not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity to repay the outstanding debt in the event of default.
In response to these conditions, Contrail management is currently in discussion with ONB to obtain a waiver to its financial covenants, to seek to revise the financing documents and/or to secure alternative financing to avoid an event of non-compliance. However, these plans have not been finalized and there is no assurance that management will be able to execute these plans. The obligations of Contrail under the Contrail Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by the Company, up to a maximum of $ 1.6  million, plus costs of collection. The Company is not liable for any other assets or liabilities of Contrail and there are no cross-default provisions with respect to Contrail’s debt in any of the Company’s debt agreements with other lenders. If Contrail were to cease operations, management believes the Company, along with the rest of its businesses, will continue to operate, given the maximum guarantee of Contrail’s obligations of $ 1.6  million, plus costs of collection. As a result, management believes it is probable that the cash on hand and current financings, net cash provided by operations from its remaining operating segments, together with amounts available under our current revolving lines of credit, as amended, will be sufficient to meet its obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business for at least 12 months following the date these financial statements are issued. Management has concluded that the plans are probable of being achieved to alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04- Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendments in this Update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this Update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06- Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The amendments in this Update defer the implementation deadline of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on our contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. 9 2.     Acquisitions Wolfe Lake HQ, LLC On December 2, 2021, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Wolfe Lake HQ, LLC, completed the purchase of the real estate located at 5000 36th Street West, St. Louis Park, Minnesota pursuant to a real estate purchase agreement with WLPC East, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company (an unaffiliated third-party) dated October 11, 2021.

In accordance with ASC 805, the purchase price consideration was allocated as follows (in thousands): Land $ 2,794   Building 8,439   Site Improvements 798   Tenant Improvements 269   In-place lease and other intangibles 1,108   $ 13,408   GdW Beheer B.V. On February 10, 2022, the Company acquired GdW, a Dutch holding company in the business of providing global aviation data and information. The acquisition was completed through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Air T Acquisition 22.1, LLC ("Air T Acquisition 22.1"), a Minnesota limited liability company, through its Dutch subsidiary, Shanwick, and was funded with cash, investment by executive management of the underlying business, and the loans described in
Note 12 . As part of the transaction, the executive management of the underlying business purchased
30.0 % of Shanwick. Air T Acquisition 22.1 and its consolidated subsidiaries are included within the Corporate and other segment. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company made certain measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation, which resulted in an increase to goodwill of $ 0.3
million. The increase is attributable to a measurement period adjustment of $ 0.3
million related to certain intangible assets acquired and related deferred tax liabilities assumed due to clarification of information utilized to determine fair value during the measurement period. As of June 30, 2022, the measurement period was completed and all adjustments are reflected in the tables below.
Total consideration is summarized in the table below (in thousands): February 10, 2022 Consideration paid $ 15,256   Less: Cash acquired ( 2,452 ) Less: Net assets acquired ( 6,520 ) Goodwill $ 6,284   10 The transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 805 "Business Combinations." Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at their fair values as of February 10, 2022, with the excess of total consideration over fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.

Recognition Substantially all of the Company’s non-lease revenue is derived from contracts with an initial expected duration of one year or less. As a result, the Company has applied the practical expedient to exclude consideration of significant financing components from the determination of transaction price, to expense costs incurred to obtain a contract, and to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations. The following is a description of the Company’s performance obligations: Type of Revenue Nature, Timing of Satisfaction of Performance Obligations, and Significant Payment Terms Product Sales The Company generates revenue from sales of various distinct products such as parts, aircraft equipment, jet engines, airframes, and scrap metal to its customers. A performance obligation is created when the Company accepts an order from a customer to provide a specified product. Each product ordered by a customer represents a performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied; generally, this occurs at a point-in-time upon shipment or when control is transferred to the customer. Transaction prices are based on contracted terms, which are at fixed amounts based on standalone selling prices. While the majority of the Company's contracts do not have variable consideration, for the limited number of contracts that do, the Company records revenue based on the standalone selling price less an estimate of variable consideration (such as rebates, discounts or prompt payment discounts). The Company estimates these amounts based on the expected incentive amount to be provided to customers and reduces revenue accordingly. Performance obligations are short-term in nature and customers are typically billed upon transfer of control. The Company records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue. The terms and conditions of the customer purchase orders or contracts are dictated by either the Company’s standard terms and conditions or by a master service agreement or by the contract. Support Services The Company provides a variety of support services such as aircraft maintenance and short-term repair services to its customers. Additionally, the Company operates certain aircraft routes on behalf of FedEx. A performance obligation is created when the Company agrees to provide a particular service to a customer. For each service, the Company recognizes revenues over time as the customer simultaneously receives the benefits provided by the Company's performance. This revenue recognition can vary from when the Company has a right to invoice to the output or input method depending on the structure of the contract and management’s analysis. For repair-type services, the Company records revenue over-time based on an input method of costs incurred to total estimated costs. The Company believes this is appropriate as the Company is performing labor hours and installing parts to enhance an asset that the customer controls. The vast majority of repair-services are short term in nature and are typically billed upon completion of the service. Some of the Company’s contracts contain a promise to stand ready as the Company is obligated to perform certain maintenance or administrative services. For most of these contracts, the Company applies the 'as invoiced' practical expedient as the Company has a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the entity's performance completed to date. A small number of contracts are accounted for as a series and recognized equal to the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to less an estimate of variable consideration (typically rebates). These services are typically ongoing and are generally billed on a monthly basis. In addition to the above type of revenues, the Company also has Leasing Revenue, which is in scope under Topic 842 (Leases) and out of scope under Topic 606 and Other Revenues (Freight, Management Fees, etc.) which are immaterial for disclosure under Topic 606.
The following table summarizes disaggregated revenues by type (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Product Sales Air Cargo $ 6,416   $ 5,493   $ 20,303   $ 17,680   Ground equipment sales 15,909   14,674   39,125   31,600   Commercial jet engines and parts 18,515   9,379   54,545   29,827   Corporate and other 112   85   247   199   Support Services Air Cargo 15,399   12,734   43,979   38,228   Ground equipment sales 96   173   396   306   Commercial jet engines and parts 2,428   1,686   6,958   5,342   Corporate and other 1,157   72   3,155   189   Leasing Revenue Air Cargo —   —   —   —   Ground equipment sales 42   141   115   219   Commercial jet engines and parts 729   298   1,939   642   Corporate and other 353   145   1,223   221   Other Air Cargo 16   21   182   38   Ground equipment sales 100   244   345   478   Commercial jet engines and parts 64   29   135   91   Corporate and other 60   259   299   580   Total $ 61,396   $ 45,433   $ 172,946   $ 125,640   See

million at an effective tax rate of
325.0 %. The Company records income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate for interim reporting. The primary factors contributing to the difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 were the change in valuation allowance related to the Company's subsidiaries in the corporate and other segment, Delphax Solutions, Inc. and Delphax Technologies, Inc. (collectively known as "Delphax") and other capital losses, the estimated benefit for the exclusion of income for the Company's captive insurance company subsidiary ("SAIC") under Section 831(b), the foreign rate differentials between the federal and foreign tax rates for Air T’s ownership of foreign operations in Puerto Rico, the Netherlands, and Singapore,
and the exclusion from the tax provision of the minority owned portion of the pretax income of Contrail. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $ 0.3
million in income tax expense at an ETR of
19.2 %. The primary factors contributing to the difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 were the change in valuation allowance related to Delphax, the estimated benefit for the exclusion of income for SAIC under Section 831(b), the exclusion from the tax provision of the minority owned portion of the pretax income of Contrail.
During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded global income tax benefit of $ 0.5
million at an effective tax rate of
20.9 %. The Company records income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate for interim reporting. The primary factors contributing to the difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 were the change in valuation allowance related to Delphax and other capital losses, the estimated benefit for the exclusion of income for SAIC under Section 831(b), the foreign rate differentials between the federal and foreign tax rates for Air T’s ownership of foreign operations in Puerto Rico, the Netherlands, and Singapore, and the exclusion from the tax provision of the minority owned portion of the pretax income of Contrail. During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $ 0.2  million in income tax expense at an effective rate of ( 3.6 )%. The primary factors contributing to the difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2021 were the change in valuation allowance related to Delphax, the estimated benefit for the exclusion of income for SAIC under Section 831(b), the exclusion from the tax provision of the minority owned portion of the pretax income of Contrail, the exclusion from taxable income of the PPP loan forgiveness income, as directed by the CARES Act enacted in 2020, and any accrued interest forgiven as a part of that Act. 14 6.     Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share has been calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Air T, Inc. stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings (loss) per share, shares issuable under stock options were considered potential common shares and were included in the weighted average common shares unless they were anti-dilutive.
During the three months ended September 30, 2022,
3,750
options were exercised under the Air T's 2012 Stock Option Plan at $ 5.75
per share, which was disclosed within our condensed consolidated statement of equity.
7,500
unexpired options remain outstanding under this plan as of
December 31, 2022. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows (in thousands, except for per share figures): Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net income (loss) $ 108   $ ( 1,189 ) $ ( 2,029 ) $ 7,141   Net income attributable to non-controlling interests ( 698 ) ( 73 ) ( 1,226 ) ( 559 ) Net (loss) income attributable to Air T, Inc.

million of previously capitalized costs related to a software project that was deemed
no longer probable to be completed and placed in service. Based on the intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2022 and assuming no subsequent additions to or impairment of the underlying assets, the remaining estimated annual amortization expense is expected to be as follows: (In thousands) Year ending March 31, Amortization 2023 (excluding the nine months ended December 31, 2022) $ 299   2024 1,117 2025 1,046 2026 963 2027 908 2028 860 Thereafter 5,958   $ 11,151   The carrying amount of goodwill as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 was $ 10.4
million and $ 10.1
million, respectively. The change from March 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 was due to foreign exchange translation. There was no impairment on goodwill during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. 16 8.     Investments in Securities and Derivative Instruments As part of the Company’s interest rate risk management strategy, the Company, from time to time, uses derivative instruments to minimize significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from rising variable interest rate costs associated with existing borrowings (Air T Term Note A and Term Note D). To meet these objectives, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts consistent with the outstanding debt to provide a fixed rate of
4.56 % and
5.09 %, respectively, on Term Notes A and D. The swaps mature in January 2028.
On August 31, 2021, Air T and Minnesota Bank & Trust ("MBT") refinanced Term Note A and fixed its interest rate at
3.42 %. As a result of this refinancing, the Company determined that the interest rate swap on Term Note A was no longer an effective hedge. The Company will amortize the fair value of the interest-rate swap contract included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with Term Note A at the time of de-designation into earnings over the remainder of its term. In addition, any changes in the fair value of Term Note A's swap after August 31, 2021 are recognized directly into earnings. The remaining swap contract associated with Term Note D is designated as an effective cash flow hedging instrument in accordance with ASC 815. On January 7, 2022, Contrail completed an interest rate swap transaction with Old National Bank ("ONB") with respect to the $ 43.6  million loan made to Contrail in November 2020 pursuant to the Main Street Priority Loan Facility as established by the U.S. Federal Reserve ("Contrail - Term Note G"). The purpose of the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction was to effectively fix the loan interest rate at
4.68 %. As of February 24, 2022, this swap contract has been designated as a cash flow hedging instrument and qualified as an effective hedge in accordance with ASC 815. During the period between January 7, 2022 and February 24, 2022, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $ 0.1  million in the consolidated statement of income (loss) due to the changes in the fair value of the instrument prior to the designation and qualification of this instrument as an effective hedge. After it was deemed an effective hedge, the Company recorded changes in the fair value of the instrument in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). For the swaps related to Air T Term Note D and Contrail - Term Note G, the effective portion of changes in the fair value on these instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the consolidated statement of income (loss) as interest expense in the same period in which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings. The interest rate swaps are considered Level 2 fair value measurements. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of these interest-rate swap contracts was an asset of $ 2.9
million and $ 0.9
million, respectively, which is included within other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $ 0.1  million and gain of $ 1.4  million, net of tax, respectively. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $ 20.0
thousand and a gain of $ 37.0
thousand, net of tax, respectively. These gains and losses are included in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for changes in the fair value of these instruments.
The Company may, from time to time, employ trading strategies designed to profit from market anomalies and opportunities it identifies. Management uses derivative financial instruments to execute those strategies, which may include options, and futures contracts. These derivative instruments are priced using publicly quoted market prices and are considered Level 1 fair value measurements. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, related to these derivative instruments, the Company had
no
gross gain and a gross loss aggregating to $ 0.1
million. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a gross gain aggregating to $ 46.0
thousand and a gross loss aggregating to $ 0.1
million. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company did
no t record any gain or loss related to derivative instruments.
The following table presents these derivative instruments at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 (in thousands): (In thousands) December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Assets: Exchange-traded options & futures Other current assets $ 484   $ —   Total assets 484   —   Liabilities: Exchange-traded options & futures Accrued Expenses and other 41   —   Total liabilities $ 41   $ —   The Company also invests in exchange-traded marketable securities and accounts for that activity in accordance with ASC 321, Investments- Equity Securities. Marketable equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair market value included in the determination of net income. The fair market value of marketable equity securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets and are therefore, considered Level 1 fair value measurements. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a gross unrealized gain aggregating to $ 0.3
million and a gross unrealized loss aggregating to $ 0.5
million. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a gross unrealized gain aggregating to $ 0.3
million and a gross unrealized loss aggregating to $ 0.8
million. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a gross unrealized gain aggregating to $ 1.7
million and a gross unrealized loss aggregating to $ 1.9
million. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a gross unrealized gain aggregating to $ 2.5
million and a gross unrealized loss aggregating to $ 2.1
million. These unrealized gains and losses are included in other income (loss) on the condensed consolidated statement of income (loss). The market value of the Company’s equity securities and cash held by the broker are periodically used as collateral against any outstanding margin account borrowings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its margin account. 17 9.     Equity Method Investments The Company’s investment in Insignia Systems, Inc. - NASDAQ: ISIG (“Insignia”) is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company has elected a three-month lag upon adoption of the equity method. As of December 31, 2022, the number of Insignia's shares owned by the Company was
0.5  million, representing approximately
27.3 % of the outstanding shares. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, due to loss attributions and impairments taken in prior fiscal years, the Company's net investment basis in Insignia was reduced to $ 0 . On August 23, 2021, Insignia restated its 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and its 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The Company evaluated these restatements and determined that they would not result in any additional impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, Insignia recorded net income of $ 11.8  million, which was primarily driven by a gain on litigation settlement of $ 12.0  million. As a result, during the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company's share of Insignia's net income for three months ended September 30, 2022 was $ 3.2
million. The Company applied $ 1.4  million to offset the cumulative value of unrecorded share of losses, resulting in net income recognition of $ 1.8  million.
The Company's
20.1 % investment in Cadillac Casting, Inc. ("CCI") is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Due to the differing fiscal year-ends, the Company has elected a three-month lag to record the CCI investment at cost, with a basis difference of $ 0.3  million. The Company recorded income of $ 0.3
million and $ 1.0
million as its share of CCI's net income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, along with a basis difference adjustment of $ 12.0
thousand and $ 37.0
thousand, respectively. The Company's net investment basis in CCI is $ 3.4
million as of December 31, 2022. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company also paid off the $ 2.0  million promissory note payable to CCI. See
Note 12 . Summarized unaudited financial information for the Company's equity method investees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Revenue $ 37,532   $ 29,408   $ 111,522   $ 87,396   Gross Profit 4,045   1,256   13,210   3,160   Operating income (loss) 13,382   ( 1,339 ) 17,172   ( 6,544 ) Net income (loss) 13,375   ( 1,434 ) 16,180   ( 5,847 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Air T, Inc. stockholders $ 2,183   $ ( 110 ) $ 2,926   $ ( 678 ) 18 10.     Inventories Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Overnight air cargo $ 28   $ 28   Ground equipment manufacturing: Raw materials 6,258   4,688   Work in process 1,549   2,437   Finished goods 6,254   9,264   Corporate and other: Raw materials 720   705   Finished goods 727   728   Commercial jet engines and parts: Whole engines available for sale or tear-down 6,703   15,403   Parts 68,328   45,036   Total inventories 90,567   78,289   Reserves ( 4,349 ) ( 3,122 ) Total inventories, net of reserves $ 86,218   $ 75,167   19 11.      Leases The Company has operating leases for the use of real estate, machinery, and office equipment. The majority of our leases have a lease term of
2
to
5
years; however, we have certain leases with longer terms of up to
30
years. Many of our leases include options to extend the lease for an additional period.
The lease term for all of the Company’s leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend the lease controlled by the lessor that is considered likely to be exercised.
Payments due under the lease contracts include fixed payments plus, for some of our leases, variable payments. Variable payments are typically operating costs associated with the underlying asset and are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed occurs. Our leases do not contain residual value guarantees.
The Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component and not to recognize leases on the balance sheet with an initial term of one year or less. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable, and as such the Company utilizes the incremental borrowing rate to calculate lease liabilities, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The components of lease cost for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 537   $ 499   $ 1,529   $ 1,366   Short-term lease cost 193   325   564   983   Variable lease cost 140   174   415   464   Total lease cost $ 870   $ 998   $ 2,508   $ 2,813   Amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for leases where we are the lessee as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Operating leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 6,391   $ 7,354   Operating lease liabilities $ 7,176   $ 8,177   Weighted-average remaining lease term Operating leases 13 years, 11 months 13 years, 5 months Weighted-average discount rate Operating leases 4.37   % 4.33   % Maturities of lease liabilities under non-cancellable leases where we are the lessee as of December 31, 2022 are as follows (in thousands): Operating Leases 2023 (excluding the nine months ended December 31, 2022) $ 431   2024 1,438   2025 1,139   2026 870   2027 704   2028 273   Thereafter 5,028   Total undiscounted lease payments 9,883   Less: Interest ( 2,275 ) Less: Discount ( 432 ) Total lease liabilities $ 7,176   20 12.     Financing Arrangements Borrowings of the Company and its subsidiaries are summarized below at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. On June 9, 2022, the Company, Jet Yard and MBT entered into Amendment No. 1 to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment”) and a related Overline Note (“Overline Note”) in the original principal amount of $ 5.0  million. The Amendment and Note memorialize an increase to the amount that may be drawn by the Company on the MBT revolving credit agreement from $ 17.0  million to $ 22.0  million. As of December 31, 2022, the unused commitment on the Overline Note and the MBT revolver was $ 5.0  million and $ 8.2  million, respectively. The total amount of borrowings under the facility as revised is now the Company’s calculated borrowing base or $ 22.0  million. The borrowing base calculation methodology remains unchanged. The interest rate on borrowings under the facility that are less than $ 17.0  million remains at the greater of
2.50 % or Prime minus
1.00 %. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the facility that exceed $ 17.0  million is the greater of
2.50 % or Prime plus
0.50 %. The commitment fee on unused borrowings below $ 17.0  million remains at
0.11 %. The commitment fee on unused borrowings above $ 17.0  million is
0.20 %. The Amendment also includes an additional covenant to the credit agreement, namely the requirement that the Company provide inventory appraisals for AirCo, AirCo Services and Worthington to MBT twice a year. The Overline loan and commitment mature on the earlier of March 31, 2023 or the date on which the Company receives all funds from the Company’s Employee Retention Credit ("ERC") application (estimated at approximately $ 9.1  million) filed on or about January 24, 2022 plus the full receipt of the Company’s carryback tax refund for the year (estimated at approximately $ 2.6  million) filed on or about August 19, 2021. Both were applied for under different components of the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has received $ 2.5
million of the ERC and $ 1.2
million of the carryback tax refunds. It is not possible to estimate when, or if, the remainder of these funds may be received. Each of the Company subsidiaries that has guaranteed the MBT revolving facility executed a guaranty acknowledgment in which they agreed to guaranty the Overline Loan and acknowledged, among other things, that the Overline Loan would not impair the lenders rights under the previously executed guaranty or security agreement. On September 30, 2022, the Company executed a promissory note payable to CCI ("Promissory Note - CCI") for $ 2.0  million that bears interest at
10.00 % per annum and matured on December 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, this note has been repaid without penalty. On November 8, 2022, Contrail entered into the Second Amendment to Master Loan Agreement (the “Amendment”) with ONB. The Amendment amends the Master Loan Agreement dated as of June 24, 2019, as amended. The principal revisions made in the Amendment are: (i) the tangible net worth covenant was revised to require that Contrail maintain a tangible net worth of at least $ 12.0  million at all times prior to March 31, 2024 and $ 15.0  million at all times on or following March 31, 2024; and, (ii) that all proceeds from certain asset sales during the period beginning on October 1, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2023 be applied as prepayments on Term Loan G. Contrail executed a Collateral Assignment of two Aircraft engines in connection with the Amendment.

The Contrail Put/Call Option permits the Seller or the Company to require Contrail to purchase all of the Seller’s equity membership interests in Contrail commencing on the fifth anniversary of the acquisition, which occurred on July 18, 2021. The Company has presented this redeemable non-controlling interest in Contrail ("Contrail RNCI") between the liabilities and equity sections of the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has elected to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Contrail RNCI is a Level 3 fair value measurement that is valued at $ 7.7
million as of December 31, 2022. The change in the redemption value compared to March 31, 2022 is an increase of $ 0.5
million, which was driven by the increase in fair value of $ 0.3
million and net income attributable to non-controlling interest of $ 0.3
million, partially offset by distributions to non-controlling interest of $ 0.1
million. As of the date of this filing, neither the Seller nor the Company has indicated an intent to exercise the put and call options. If either side were to exercise the option, the Company anticipates that the price would approximate the fair value of the Contrail RNCI, as determined on the transaction date. The Company currently expects that it would fund any required payment from cash provided by operations. On May 5, 2021, the Company formed an aircraft asset management business called Contrail Asset Management, LLC ("CAM"), and an aircraft capital joint venture called Contrail JV II LLC ("CJVII"). The venture focuses on acquiring commercial aircraft and jet engines for leasing, trading and disassembly. CJVII targets investments in current generation narrow-body aircraft and engines, building on Contrail’s origination and asset management expertise. The Company and Mill Road Capital (“MRC”) agreed to become common members in CAM. CAM serves two separate and distinct functions: 1) to direct the sourcing, acquisition and management of aircraft assets owned by CJVII, and 2) to directly invest into CJVII alongside other institutional investment partners. CAM has an initial commitment to CJVII of approximately $ 53.0  million, which is comprised of an $ 8.0  million initial commitment from the Company and an approximately $ 45.0  million initial commitment from MRC. As of December 31, 2022, CAM's remaining capital commitments are approximately $ 0.7
million from the Company and $ 16.0
million from MRC. In connection with the formation of CAM, MRC has a fixed price put option of $ 1.0  million to sell its common equity in CAM to the Company at each of the first 3 anniversary dates. At the later of (a)
five years
after execution of the agreement and (b) distributions to MRC per the waterfall equal to their capital contributions, the Company has a call option and MRC has a put option on the MRC common interests in CAM. If either party exercises the option, the exercise price will be fair market value if the Company pays in cash at closing or
112.5 % of fair market value if the Company opts to pay in three equal annual installments after exercise. The Company recorded MRC's $ 1.0  million put option within "Other non-current liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets.
In February 2022, in connection with the Company's acquisition of GdW, a consolidated subsidiary of Shanwick, the Company entered into a shareholder agreement with the
30.0 % non-controlling interest owners of Shanwick, providing for the governance of and the terms of membership interests in Shanwick. The shareholder agreement includes the Shanwick Put/Call Option with regard to the
30.0 % non-controlling interest. The non-controlling interest holders are the executive management of the underlying business. The Shanwick Put/Call Option grants the Company an option to purchase the
30.0 % interest at the call option price that equals to the average EBIT over the 3 Financial Years prior to the exercise of the Call Option multiplied by 8. In addition, the Shanwick Put/Call Option also grants the non-controlling interest owners an option to require the Company to purchase from them their respective ownership interests at the Put Option price, that is equal to the average EBIT over the 3 Financial Years prior to the exercise of the Put Option multiplied by 7.5. The Call Option and the Put Option may be exercised at any time from the fifth anniversary of the shareholder agreement and then only at the end of each fiscal year of Air T ("Shanwick RNCI"). The Company has presented this redeemable non-controlling interest in Shanwick between the liabilities and equity sections of the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has elected to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the estimated redemption value at the end of each reporting period. As the Shanwick RNCI will be redeemed at established multiples of EBIT, it is considered redeemable at other than fair value. Changes in its estimated redemption value are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations within non-controlling interests.
The Shanwick RNCI's estimated redemption value is $ 4.4  million as of December 31, 2022, which was comprised of the following (in thousands): Shanwick RNCI Beginning Balance as of April 1, 2022 $ 3,583   Contribution from non-controlling members —   Distribution to non-controlling members ( 158 ) Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 147   Redemption value adjustments 829   Ending Balance as of
December 31, 2022 $ 4,401   2020 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan On December 29, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors unanimously approved the Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which was subsequently approved by the Company's stockholders at the August 18, 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The total number of shares authorized under the Plan is
420,000 . Among other instruments, the Plan permits the Company to grant stock option awards. As of December 31, 2022, options to purchase up to
293,400
shares are outstanding under the Plan. Vesting of options is based on the grantee meeting specified service conditions. Furthermore, the number of vested options that a grantee is able to exercise, if any, is based on the Company’s stock price as of the vesting dates specified in the respective option grant agreements. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, total compensation cost recognized under the Plan was $ 79.0  thousand and $ 0.2  million, respectively.
25 17.      Subsequent Events On January 31, 2023, Air T entered into a new secured loan with MBT ("Term Note F"). The loan is in the principal amount of $ 1.0  million and bears a fluctuating annual rate of interest equal to the greater of (a)
6.00 % or (b) the sum of (i) the Prime Rate plus (ii)
1.00 %. The note obligates the Company to make monthly payments of principal in the amount of $ 17 .0 thousand plus accrued interest commencing March 1, 2023. The loan matures on January 31, 2028. In addition, the Company also entered into a promissory note agreement ("Seller's Note") with Worldwide Aviation LLC ("WASI") in the principal amount of $ 1.5  million. The note bears a fixed annual interest rate of
6.00 % and matures on January 1, 2026.
The proceeds from Term Note F and Seller's Note, as well as additional cash of $ 0.6  million were used to acquire
100.0 % interest in WASI, a Missouri-based company involved in the aircraft servicing business, on January 31, 2023. 26 Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (including the information presented therein under Risk Factors), as well other publicly available information. Overview Air T, Inc. (the “Company,” “Air T,” “we” or “us”) is a holding company with a portfolio of operating businesses and financial assets. Our goal is to prudently and strategically diversify Air T’s earnings power and compound the growth in its free cash flow per share over time. We currently operate in four industry segments: • Overnight air cargo, which operates in the air express delivery services industry; • Ground equipment sales, which manufactures and provides mobile deicers and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines, airports, the military and industrial customers; • Commercial aircraft, engines and parts, which manages and leases aviation assets; supplies surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engine components; provides commercial aircraft disassembly/part-out services; commercial aircraft parts sales; procurement services and overhaul and repair services to airlines and, • Corporate and other, which acts as the capital allocator and resource for other consolidated businesses. Further, Corporate and other also comprises insignificant businesses and business interests that do not pertain to other reportable segments.
Each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services. We evaluate the performance of our business segments based on operating income and Adjusted EBITDA.  Results of Operations Impacts from Geopolitical, Macroeconomic, and COVID-19 Challenges We continue to be exposed to macroeconomic pressures as a result of the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges, foreign currency fluctuations, spikes in commodity prices and geopolitical challenges, including the war in Eastern
27 Europe. We continue to navigate through these challenges with a sharp focus on and goal of safeguarding our employees, helping our customers and managing impacts on our supply chain.
COVID-19 and its impact on the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas present uncertainty and risk with respect to our financial condition and results of operations. Each of our businesses implemented measures to attempt to limit the impact of COVID-19 but we still experienced disruptions, and we experienced and continue to experience to a lesser degree a reduction in demand for commercial aircraft, jet engines and parts compared to historical periods. Our businesses may continue to generate reduced operating cash flow and may continue to operate at a loss from time to time during fiscal 2023. We expect that the impact of COVID-19 will continue to some extent. The fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 on economic and market conditions, and, as a result, present material uncertainty and risk with respect to us and our results of operations. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions underlying the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable and supportable based on the information available as of December 31, 2022; however, uncertainty over the ultimate direct and indirect impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy generally, and the Company’s businesses in particular, makes any estimates and assumptions as of December 31, 2022 inherently less certain than they would be absent the current and potential impacts of COVID-19. The war in Eastern Europe and related sanctions imposed on Russia and related actors and other macroeconomic factors have resulted in interest rate acceleration and inflation, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in the price of commodities. These factors may negatively impact our businesses at least in the short-term. The ultimate impact on our overall financial condition and operating results will depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of these activities. We continue to evaluate the long-term impact that these may have on our business model, however there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken or will take will completely offset the negative impact.
Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Compared to Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Consolidated revenue for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 increased by $16.0 million (35.1%) compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Following is a table detailing revenue by segment, net of intercompany during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Overnight Air Cargo $ 21,831  $ 18,248  $ 3,583  19.6  % Ground Equipment Sales 16,147  15,232  915  6.0  % Commercial Jet Engines and Parts 21,736  11,392  10,344  90.8  % Corporate and Other 1,682  561  1,121  199.8  % $ 61,396  $ 45,433  $ 15,963  35.1  % Revenues from the air cargo segment for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 increased by $3.6 million (19.6%) compared to the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. The increase was principally attributable to higher administrative fees, maintenance labor and pass-through revenues from FedEx. The ground equipment sales segment contributed approximately $16.1 million and $15.2 million to the Company’s revenues for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, representing a $0.9 million (6.0%) increase in the current quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in part sales this quarter compared to prior year's comparable quarter as commercial and military customers require parts to perform maintenance on their trucks. At December 31, 2022, the ground equipment sales segment’s order backlog was $12.5 million compared to $3.7 million at December 31, 2021.
The commercial jet engines and parts segment contributed $21.7 million of revenues in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to $11.4 million in the comparable prior year quarter, which is an increase of $10.3 million (90.8%). The increase was primarily driven by higher component part sales across all companies within the segment in the current quarter compared to prior year comparable quarter. Revenues from the corporate and other segment for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 increased by $1.1 million (199.8%) compared to the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions mentioned in

Following is a table detailing operating income (loss) by segment during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 28 Three Months Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Overnight Air Cargo $ 1,009  $ 475  $ 534  Ground Equipment Sales 1,093  1,463  (370) Commercial Jet Engines and Parts 733  336  397  Corporate and Other (2,700) (2,249) (451) $ 135  $ 25  $ 110  Consolidated operating income for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $0.1 million, compared to an operating income of $25.0 thousand in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The air cargo segment's operating income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 was $1.0 million compared to operating income of $0.5 million in the same quarter in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue increase noted above. The ground equipment sales segment's operating income for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $0.4 million from the prior year comparable quarter to $1.1 million. This decrease was primarily attributable to the increased costs for material, labor, and overhead required to get truck units scheduled and built. The commercial jet engines and parts segment generated operating income of $0.7 million in the current-year quarter compared to operating income of $0.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue mentioned above offset by an increase of $0.4 million in inventory write-down in the current quarter compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. The corporate and other segment's operating loss for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 was $2.7 million compared to an operating loss of $2.2 million in the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to the timing of bonus payments made compared to last year. Following is a table detailing non-operating income (expense) during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Interest expense $ (2,204) $ (1,236) $ (968) Income from equity method investments 2,118  99  2,019  Other-than-temporary impairment loss on investments —  (348) 348  Other (97) (11) (86) $ (183) $ (1,496) $ 1,313  The Company had a net non-operating loss of $0.2 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to net non-operating loss of $1.5 million in the prior-year quarter. In the current-year quarter, the Company had higher interest expense due to having more outstanding TruPs shares and more indebtedness at Contrail compared to the prior-year quarter offset by an increase in income from equity method investments, primarily driven by the $1.8 million share of net income recognized from Insignia. See
Note 9
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. In addition, in the prior-year quarter, an impairment loss of $0.3 million was recorded for CCI that did not recur in the current-year quarter.
During the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded global income tax benefit of $0.2 million at an effective tax rate ("ETR") of 325.0%. The Company records income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate for interim reporting. The primary factors contributing to the difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 were the change in valuation allowance related to Delphax and other capital losses, the estimated benefit for the exclusion of income for SAIC under Section 831(b), the foreign rate differentials between the federal and foreign tax rates for Air T’s ownership of foreign operations in Puerto Rico, the Netherlands, and Singapore, and the exclusion from the tax provision of the minority owned portion of the pretax income of Contrail. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $0.3 million in income tax benefit at an effective tax rate ("ETR") of 19.2%. The primary factors contributing to the difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 were the change in valuation allowance related to
29 Delphax, the estimated benefit for the exclusion of income for SAIC under Section 831(b), and the exclusion from the tax provision of the minority owned portion of the pretax income of
Contrail. First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023 Compared to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2022 Following is a table detailing revenue by segment (in thousands): Nine Months Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Overnight Air Cargo $ 64,464  $ 55,946  $ 8,518  15.2  % Ground Equipment Sales 39,981  32,603  7,378  22.6  % Commercial Jet Engines and Parts 63,577  35,902  27,675  77.1  % Corporate and Other 4,924  1,189  3,735  314.1  % $ 172,946  $ 125,640  $ 47,306  37.7  % Revenues from the air cargo segment for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $8.5 million (15.2%) compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was principally attributable to increased administrative fees as well as higher pass-through revenue from FedEx as a result of increased business activity. The ground equipment sales segment contributed approximately $40.0 million and $32.6 million to the Company’s revenues for the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, representing a $7.4 million (22.6%) increase in the current nine-month period. The increase was primarily driven by increased pricing of truck units sold and higher parts and service revenue. The commercial jet engines and parts segment contributed $63.6 million of revenues in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $35.9 million in the comparable prior year nine months. The increase was primarily driven by higher component part sales across all companies within the segment and engine sales at AirCo 1 that did not occur in the prior fiscal year. Revenues from the corporate and other segment in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $3.7 million (314.1%) compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions mentioned in

Operating income for the air cargo segment for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.9 million versus the prior year comparable period primarily due to the revenue increase noted above. The ground equipment sales segment operating income increased by $0.2 million to $3.1 million in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 versus the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily attributable to the revenue increase noted above. The commercial jet engines and parts segment generated an operating income of $3.6 million in the current-year nine month period compared to an operating income of $2.0 million in the prior-year nine-month period. The change was primarily attributable to the increased component sales as well as engine sales at AirCo 1 as explained in the segment revenue discussion above. 30 The corporate and other segment's operating loss increased by $2.2 million to $8.5 million from the prior-year loss of $6.3 million primarily driven by higher benefits cost and the timing of bonus payments compared to last year for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Following is a table detailing non-operating income (loss) during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same nine months in the prior fiscal year (in thousands): Nine Months Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Interest expense $ (6,021) $ (3,341) $ (2,680) Income from equity method investments 2,917  197  2,720  Gain on forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan —  8,331  (8,331) Other-than-temporary impairment loss on investments —  (348) 348  Other (608) 1,329  $ (1,937) $ (3,712) $ 6,168  $ (9,880) The Company had a net non-operating loss of $3.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net non-operating income of $6.2 million in the prior-year nine-month period. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $8.3 million gain recognized on the SBA's forgiveness of the Company's PPP loan in the prior year period which did not occur in the current period. In the current year, the Company incurred $2.7 million higher interest expense due to having more outstanding TruPs shares and more indebtedness at Contrail. In addition, the Company recorded a $0.4 million unrealized loss due to fair value adjustments on our marketable investments in the current year compared to prior year's $0.3 million unrealized gain. The decrease was partially offset by $2.7 million higher net income from equity method investments in the current year compared to the prior year, primarily driven by $1.8 million share of net income from Insignia. See
Note 9
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded global income tax benefit of $0.5 million at an effective tax rate of 20.9%. The Company records income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate for interim reporting. The primary factors contributing to the difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 were the change in valuation allowance related to Delphax and other capital losses, the estimated benefit for the exclusion of income for SAIC under Section 831(b), the foreign rate differentials between the federal and foreign tax rates for Air T’s ownership of foreign operations in Puerto Rico, the Netherlands, and Singapore, and the exclusion from the tax provision of the minority owned portion of the pretax income of Contrail. During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $0.2 million in income tax benefit which resulted in an effective tax rate of (3.6)%. The primary factors contributing to the difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2021 were the changes in valuation allowance related to Delphax, the estimated benefit for the exclusion of income for SAIC under Section 831(b), the exclusion from the tax provision of the minority owned portion of the pretax income of Contrail, the exclusion from taxable income of the PPP loan forgiveness income, as directed by the CARES Act enacted in 2020, and any accrued interest forgiven as a part of that Act.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company’s significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. The preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions. The Company’s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from estimates. There were no significant changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates during the three-months ended December 31, 2022. Seasonality The ground equipment sales segment business has historically been seasonal, with the revenues and operating income typically being lower in the first and fourth fiscal quarters as commercial deicers are typically delivered prior to the winter season. Other segments have typically not experienced material seasonal trends. Supply Chain and Inflation 31 The Company continues to monitor a wide range of health, safety, and regulatory matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic including its impact on our business operations. In particular, supply chain disruptions have impacted product availability and costs across all markets including the aviation industry in which our company operates. Additionally, the United States is experiencing workforce shortages and increasing inflation which has created a competitive wage environment. Thus far, the direct impact of these items on our businesses has not been material. However, ongoing or future disruptions to consumer demand, our supply chain, product pricing inflation, our ability to attract and retain employees, or our ability to procure products and fulfill orders, could negatively impact the Company’s operations and financial results in a material manner. We continue to look for proactive ways to mitigate potential impacts of supply chain disruptions at our businesses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, the Company held approximately $6.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, $1.3 million of which related to restricted cash collateralized held for three opportunity zone investments made by the Company - Air T OZ 1, LLC, Air T OZ 2, LLC, and Air T OZ 3, LLC (the "Opportunity Zone Funds"), each a Minnesota limited liability company and a subsidiary of the Company. The Company also held $1.5 million in restricted investments held as statutory reserve of SAIC. The Company has approximately $0.6 million of marketable securities and an aggregate of approximately $22.0 million in available funds under its lines of credit as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s working capital amounted to $63.2 million, a decrease of $34.2 million compared to March 31, 2022 primarily driven by the increase in current portion of long-term debt as the revolving lines of credit at Air T with MBT and Contrail with ONB become due within a year.
As mentioned in
Note 12
of Notes to condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this report, on June 9, 2022, the Company, Jet Yard and MBT entered into Amendment No. 1 to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment”) and a related Overline Note (“Overline Note”) in the original principal amount of $5.0 million. The Amendment and Note memorialize an increase to the amount that may be drawn by the Company on the MBT revolving credit agreement from $17.0 million to $22.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the unused commitment on the Overline Note and the MBT revolver was $5.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively. The total amount of borrowings under the facility as revised is now the Company’s calculated borrowing base or $22.0 million. The borrowing base calculation methodology remains unchanged. As mentioned in
Note 9
and
Note 12
of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this report, on September 30, 2022, the Company executed a promissory note payable to CCI for $2.0 million that bears interest at 10.00% per annum and matured on December 30, 2022. The note may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The note is subordinate and junior to any and all indebtedness of the Company to MBT. As of December 31, 2022, this note has been repaid. As mentioned in
Note 15
of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this Report on Form 10-Q, in 2016, Contrail entered into an Operating Agreement with the Seller providing for the put and call options with regard to the 21.0% non-controlling interest retained by the Seller. The Seller is the founder of Contrail and its current Chief Executive Officer. The Put/Call Option permits the Seller or the Company to require Contrail Aviation to purchase all of the Seller’s equity membership interests in Contrail Aviation commencing on July 18, 2021. As of the date of this filing, neither the Seller nor the Company has indicated an intent to exercise the put and call options. If either side were to exercise the option, the Company anticipates that the price would approximate the fair value of the Contrail RNCI, as determined on the transaction date. The Company currently expects that it would fund any required payment from cash provided by operations. As mentioned in
Note 15
of Notes to condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this report, on May 5, 2021, the Company formed an aircraft asset management business called CAM and an aircraft capital joint venture called CJVII. The venture focuses on acquiring commercial aircraft and jet engines for leasing, trading and disassembly. CJVII targets investments in current generation narrow-body aircraft and engines, building on Contrail Aviation’s origination and asset management expertise. CAM serves two separate and distinct functions: 1) to direct the sourcing, acquisition and management of aircraft assets owned by CJVII, and 2) to directly invest into CJVII alongside other institutional investment partners. CAM has an initial commitment to CJVII of approximately $53.0 million, which is comprised of an $8.0 million initial commitment from the Company and an approximately $45.0 million initial commitment from MRC. As of December 31, 2022, CAM's remaining capital commitments are approximately $0.7 million from the Company and $16.0 million from MRC. CJVII was initially capitalized with up to $408.0 million of equity from the Company and three institutional investor partners, consisting of $108.0 million in initial commitments and $300.0 million in upsize capacity, contingent on underwriting and transaction appeal. As of the date of this filing, certain institutional investors have gone into upsize capacity and $113.3 million of capital has been deployed to CJVII. The timing of the remaining capital commitment is not yet known at this time.
The Contrail Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of Contrail and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee indebtedness, incur liens, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments, make changes in the nature of its business, and engage in transactions with
32 affiliates. The Contrail Credit Agreement also contains quarterly financial covenants applicable to Contrail and its subsidiaries, including a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.0 and a minimum tangible net worth of $12.0 million. The Company is in compliance with such financial covenants as of December 31, 2022. However, management is forecasting that the Company will be in violation of the debt service coverage ratio during the twelve month period subsequent to the date of this filing, primarily because the first principal payment of its Term Note G becomes due in November 2023. Non-compliance with a debt covenant that is not subsequently cured gives ONB the right to accelerate the maturity of the Contrail Credit Agreement and declare the entire amount of Contrail’s outstanding debt at the time of non-compliance immediately due and payable and exercise its remedies with respect to the collateral that secures the debt. Should ONB accelerate the maturity of the Contrail Credit Agreement, the Company would not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity to repay the outstanding debt in the event of default.
In response to these conditions, Contrail management is currently in discussion with ONB to obtain a waiver to its financial covenants, to seek to revise the financing documents and/or to secure alternative financing to avoid an event of non-compliance. However, these plans have not been finalized and there is no assurance that management will be able to execute these plans. The obligations of Contrail under the Contrail Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by the Company, up to a maximum of $1.6 million, plus costs of collection. The Company is not liable for any other assets or liabilities of Contrail and there are no cross-default provisions with respect to Contrail’s debt in any of the Company’s debt agreements with other lenders. If Contrail were to cease operations, management believes the Company, along with the rest of its businesses, will continue to operate, given the maximum guarantee of Contrail’s obligations of $1.6 million, plus costs of collection. The revolving lines of credit at Air T with MBT and Contrail with ONB have a due date or expire within the next twelve months. We are currently seeking to refinance these obligations prior to their respective maturity dates; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to execute this refinancing or, if we are able to refinance these obligations, that the terms of such refinancing would be as favorable as the terms of our existing credit facility. As a result, management believes it is probable that the cash on hand and current financings, net cash provided by operations from its remaining operating segments, together with amounts available under our current revolving lines of credit, as amended, will be sufficient to meet its obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business for at least 12 months following the date these financial statements are issued. Management has concluded that the plans are probable of being achieved to alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Cash Flows Following is a table of changes in cash flow for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities $ (3,815) $ (19,690) Net Cash Used in Investing Activities (3,090) (19,546) Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 4,866  29,079  Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 181  69  Net Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash $ (1,858) $ (10,088) Net cash used in operating activities was $3.8 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $19.7 million in the prior year nine-month period, resulting in an overall decrease of $15.9 million period over period. The change in net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by a net increase in cash provided by receivables of $9.3 million due to increased sales in the current period, receipt of ERC payments of $2.4 million, and higher payables and accrued expenses of $5.0 million, mostly attributable to timing of payroll and an increase in customer deposits received. In the current period, there was an additional purchase accounting adjustment related to the acquisition of GdW that increased our deferred tax liabilities by $2.4 million. See
Note 2
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. Those changes are
offset by a $3.8 million net increase in cash used to purchase inventories at Contrail and AirCo in the current year. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 was $3.1 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $19.5 million in the prior-year period. The decrease in cash usage in investing activities was primarily driven by fewer investments in unconsolidated entities and no acquisition of assets in the current year, as compared to $13.4 million in the prior year. 33 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 was $4.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $29.1 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced proceeds from and increased payments to outstanding term notes in the current year, as well as issuance of TruPs in the prior year that did not recur in the current year. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from lines of credit in the current year. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Company's financial performance. This performance measure is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specific items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes. When calculating Adjusted EBITDA, the Company does not add back depreciation expense for aircraft engines that are on lease, as the Company believes this expense matches with the corresponding revenue earned on engine leases. Depreciation expense for leased engines totaled $0.5 million and $70.4 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's performance because it provides investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace or be an alternative to operating income (loss), the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP. The tables below provide a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Three months ended Nine months ended 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Operating income $ 135  $ 25  $ 1,147  $ 724  Depreciation and amortization (excluding leased engines depreciation) 560  372  1,810  956  Asset impairment, restructuring or impairment charges 638  —  2,174  —  (Gain) Loss on disposition of assets —  —  (2) 3  Securities expenses 4  150  38  215  Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,337  $ 547  $ 5,167  $ 1,898  The asset impairment, restructuring or impairment charges for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was a write-down of $0.6 million on the commercial jet engines and parts segment's inventory.

As interest rates have increased, are projected to increase and can be volatile, the Company has designated a risk management policy which permits the use of derivative instruments to provide protection against rising interest rates on variable rate debt.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, referred to collectively herein as the Certifying Officers, are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures. The Certifying Officers have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 240.13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that review and evaluation, which included inquiries made to certain other employees of the Company, the Certifying Officers have concluded that the Company’s current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, are effective in ensuring that information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving the stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. There has not been any change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
