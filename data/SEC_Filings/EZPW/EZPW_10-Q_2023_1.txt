NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business EZCORP, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a provider of pawn loans in the United States ("U.S.") and Latin America. Pawn loans are non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible property. We also sell merchandise, primarily collateral forfeited from pawn lending operations and pre-owned merchandise purchased from customers. Basis of Presentation The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (“Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30,
2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 16, 2022 (“2022 Annual Report”). In the opinion of management, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation. Financial results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 or any other period due, in part, to seasonal variations. There have been no changes that have had a material impact in significant accounting policies as described in our 2022
Annual Report . Principles of Consolidation The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of EZCORP, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
We use the equity method of accounting for entities in which we have a 50% or less investment and exercise significant influence. We account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairments. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions include the determination of inventory reserves, expected credit losses, useful lives of long-lived and intangible assets, valuation of share-based compensation, valuation of equity investments, valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, loss contingencies related to litigation and discount rates used for operating leases. We base our estimates on historical experience, observable trends and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements We reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following tables present summary financial information for Cash Converters most recently reported results at June 30, 2022 after translation to U.S. dollars:   June 30, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Current assets $ 158,987   $ 167,553   Non-current assets 170,798   191,788   Total assets $ 329,785   $ 359,341   Current liabilities $ 59,256   $ 61,395   Non-current liabilities 53,045   57,511   Shareholders’ equity 217,484   240,435   Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 329,785   $ 359,341     Full-Year Ended June 30, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Gross revenues $ 178,215   $ 150,165   Gross profit 116,106   105,851   Net profit 8,099   12,081   See Note 6: Fair Value Measurements for the fair value and carrying value of our investment in Cash Converters. Founders One, LLC In October 2021, we invested $ 15.0  million in exchange for a non-redeemable voting participating preferred equity interest in Founders One, LLC (“Founders”), a then newly-formed entity with one other member. Founders used that $ 15.0  million to acquire an equity interest in Simple Management Group, Inc. (“SMG”).
On December 2, 2022, we contributed an additional $ 15.0  million to Founders associated with our preferred interest, which proceeds were used by Founders to acquire additional common stock in SMG. In addition, we loaned $ 15.0  million to Founders in exchange for a Demand Promissory Note secured by the common interest in Founders held by the other member. We have an interest in Founders, a variable interest entity, but because the Company is not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate Founders.
Further, as we are not the appointed manager, we do not have the ability to direct the activities of the investment entity that most significantly impact its economic performance. Consequently, our equity investment in Founders is accounted for utilizing the measurement alternative within Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 321, Investments — Equity Securities. Our $ 30.0  million carrying value of the investment and $ 15.0  million Demand Promissory Note are included in “Other investments” and "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Our maximum exposure for losses related to our investment in Founders is our $ 30.0  million equity investment and $ 15.0  million Demand Promissory Note plus accrued and unpaid interest. 10 Table of Contents See Note 6: Fair Value Measurements for the fair values and carrying values of our investment in and loan to Founders, respectively. NOTE 6: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories: • Level 1 — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 — Other observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. • Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
We have elected not to measure at fair value any eligible items for which fair value measurement is optional.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 for financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the periods presented. Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value The tables below present our estimates of fair value of financial assets and liabilities that were not measured at fair value: Carrying Value Estimated Fair Value   December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurement Using (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets: 2.89 % promissory note receivable due April 2024 $ 1,224   $ 1,224   $ —   $ —   $ 1,224   12.00 % promissory note receivable from Founders 15,100   15,100   —   —   15,100   Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 37,789   43,497   43,497   —   —   Other investments 39,220   39,220   —   —   39,220   Financial liabilities: 2024 Convertible Notes $ 34,143   $ 35,851   $ —   $ 35,851   $ —   2025 Convertible Notes 102,192   89,883   —   89,883   —   2029 Convertible Notes 222,649   225,975   —   225,975   —   Carrying Value Estimated Fair Value   December 31, 2021 December 31, 2021 Fair Value Measurement Using (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets: 2.89 % promissory note receivable due April 2024 $ 1,190   $ 1,190   $ —   $ —   $ 1,190   Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 42,513   52,671   45,650   —   7,021   Other investments 16,500   16,500   —   —   16,500   Financial liabilities: 2024 Convertible Notes $ 142,106   $ 147,063   $ —   $ 147,063   $ —   2025 Convertible Notes 169,738   155,060   —   155,060   —   Carrying Value Estimated Fair Value   September 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 Fair Value Measurement Using (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets: 2.89 % promissory note receivable due April 2024 $ 1,215   $ 1,215   $ —   $ —   $ 1,215   Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 37,733   40,279   40,279   —   —   Other investments 24,220   24,220   —   —   24,220   Financial liabilities: 2024 Convertible Notes $ 142,575   $ 157,727   $ —   $ 157,727   $ —   2025 Convertible Notes 170,328   147,488   —   147,488   —   11 Table of Contents Due to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, pawn loans and pawn service charges receivable, we estimate that the carrying value approximates fair value. We consider our cash and cash equivalents to be measured using Level 1 inputs and our pawn loans, pawn service charges receivable and other debt to be measured using Level 3 inputs. Significant increases or decreases in the underlying assumptions used to value pawn loans, pawn service charges receivable, consumer loans, fees and interest receivable and other debt could significantly increase or decrease these fair value estimates. Included in "Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 is $ 4.6  million, representing the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration associated with the acquisition in June 2021 of PLO del Bajio S. de R.S. de C.V., which owned stores operating under the name "Cash Apoyo Efectivo" and located principally in the Mexico City metropolitan area. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration are estimated by management, not observable in the market and, therefore, considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. In March 2019, we received $ 1.1  million in previously escrowed seller funds as a result of settling certain indemnification claims with the seller of GPMX. In April 2019, we loaned the $ 1.1  million back to the seller of GPMX in exchange for a promissory note.
The note bears interest at the rate of
2.89 % per annum and is secured by certain marketable securities owned by the seller and held in a U.S. brokerage account. All principal and accrued interest is due and payable in April 2024. The fair value of the note approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2022. In December 2022, we loaned $ 15.0  million to Founders in exchange for a Demand Promissory Note secured by the common interest in Founders held by the other member. The note bears interest at the rate of
12.00 % per annum, and all principal and accrued interest is due on demand. The fair value of the note approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2022. We use the equity method of accounting to account for our ownership interest in Cash Converters. The inputs used to generate the fair value of the investment in Cash Converters were considered Level 1 inputs.
These inputs consist of (a) the quoted stock price on the Australian Stock Exchange multiplied by (b) the number of shares we owned multiplied by (c) the applicable foreign currency exchange rate as of the end of our reporting period. We included no control premium for owning a large percentage of outstanding shares. Of the $ 39.2  million of "Other investments" included in the table above, $ 30.0  million is related the investment in Founders and $ 6.2  million related to our investment in
Rich Data Corporation ("RDC") . We believe the investment's fair value approximated its carrying value although such fair value is highly variable and includes significant unobservable inputs.
We measured the fair value of the 2024, 2025 and 2029 Convertible Notes using quoted price inputs. The notes are not actively traded, and thus the price inputs represent a Level 2 measurement. As the quoted price inputs are highly variable from day to day, the fair value estimates disclosed above could significantly increase or decrease. 12 Table of Contents NOTE 7: DEBT The following table presents the Company's debt instruments outstanding:   December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 September 30, 2022 (in thousands) Gross Amount Debt Issuance Costs Carrying Amount Gross Amount Debt Issuance Costs Carrying Amount Gross Amount Debt

million aggregate principal amount of  3.750 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029 (the “2029 Convertible Notes”). The 2029 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated December 12, 2022 (the "2022 Indenture") by and between the Company and Truist Bank, as trustee. The 2029 Convertible Notes were issued in a private offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 2029 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of  3.750 % per annum on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2023, and mature on December 15, 2029 (the "2029 Maturity Date"), unless converted,
13 Table of Contents redeemed or repurchased in accordance with the terms prior to such date. At maturity, the holders of the 2029 Convertible Notes will be entitled to receive cash equal to the principal of the 2029 Convertible Notes plus accrued interest.
The effective interest rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately
4.28 %.
As of December 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs will be amortized using the effective interest method through the 2029 Maturity Date assuming no early conversion. The 2029 Convertible Notes are convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 89.0313 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $ 11.23
per share). The conversion rate will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2029 Convertible Notes contain certain make-whole fundamental change premiums and customary anti-dilution adjustments.
Upon conversion, we may settle in cash, shares of Class A Common Stock or any combination thereof, at our election. Prior to June 15, 2029, the 2029 Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2023 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of
30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to
130 % of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the

130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any
30

NOTE 8: COMMON STOCK AND STOCK COMPENSATION Common Stock Repurchase Program On May 3, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") authorized the repurchase of up to $ 50  million of our Class A Common Stock over
three years
(the "Common Stock Repurchase Program"). Execution of the program will be responsive to fluctuating market conditions and valuations, liquidity needs and the expected return on investment compared to other opportunities. The amount and timing of purchases will be dependent on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, general market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements, general business conditions, the level of cash flows, and corporate considerations determined by management and the Board, such as liquidity and capital needs and the availability of attractive alternative investment opportunities. The Board of Directors has reserved the right to modify, suspend or terminate the program at any time. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has repurchased and retired
481,005
shares of our Class A Common Stock for $ 4.1  million under the Common Stock Repurchase Program. The repurchase amount is allocated between "Additional paid-in capital" and "Retained earnings" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Other Common Stock Repurchases During December 2022, the Company used approximately $ 5.0  million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase for cash
578,703
shares of its Class A common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. Such transactions were authorized separately from, and not considered a part of, the publicly announced share repurchase program discussed above. The repurchase amount is allocated between "Additional paid-in capital" and "Retained earnings" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Stock Compensation We maintain a Board-approved incentive plan to retain the services of our valued officers, directors and employees and to incentivize such persons to make contributions to our company and motivate excellent performance (the "Incentive Plan"). Under the Incentive Plan, we grant awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. Awards granted to employees are typically subject to performance and service conditions. Awards granted to non-employee directors are time-based awards subject only to service conditions. Awards granted under the Incentive Plan are measured at the grant date fair value with compensation costs associated with the awards recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. The following table presents a summary of stock compensation activity: Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding as of September 30, 2022 2,113,323   $ 5.88   Granted

NOTE 9: CONTINGENCIES Currently, and from time to time, we are involved in various claims, disputes, lawsuits, investigations, and legal and regulatory proceedings, including the matter described below. We accrue for contingencies if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies requires judgments and is highly subjective about future events, and the amount of resulting loss may differ from these estimates. We do not believe the resolution of any particular matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 16 Table of Contents On October 14, 2021, Andrew Kowlessar filed an action in the Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida styled

In May 2022, the federal court action was dismissed and the case was refiled in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida. The complaint was brought under Section 501.059, Florida Statutes, the Florida Telephone Solicitation Act (“Act”), and alleges certain text messages were sent in violation of the Act. The matter involves claims by a single individual, but alleges a class of persons who may have similar claims of violations of the Act and seeks class certification. On June 16, 2022, following discovery and pre-trial mediation, the parties agreed to a settlement of all asserted claims and entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release. The agreed settlement requires the Company to make available up to $ 5  million to be used to pay verified claims (not to exceed $ 70
per verified claimant), as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. The agreed settlement was approved by the court on October 24, 2022; the period for submitting claims expired on November 8, 2022; and the third-party claims administrator has verified the submitted claims and is set to undertake final resolution. The Company recorded a charge during the quarter ended June 30, 2022, representing the estimated liability for the settlement of this matter and believes the accrual remains sufficient to cover the Company’s liability in this matter. NOTE 10: SEGMENT INFORMATION Our operations are primarily managed on a geographical basis and are comprised of
three
reportable segments. The factors for determining our reportable segments include the manner in which our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") evaluates performance for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance.
We currently report our segments as follows:
• U.S. Pawn — all pawn activities in the United States; • Latin America Pawn — all pawn activities in Mexico and other parts of Latin America; and • Other Investments — primarily our equity interest in the net income of Cash Converters along with our investment in Founders and RDC. There are no inter-segment revenues presented below, and the amounts below were determined in accordance with the same accounting principles used in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of EZCORP, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us”, “our”, "EZCORP" or the “Company”). The following discussion should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere within this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See
"Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30,
2022, as supplemented by the information set forth in “Part I, Item 3 — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and "Part II, Item 1A — Risk Factors" of this Report, for a discussion of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Business Overview EZCORP is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas. We are a leading provider of pawn services in the United States and Latin America. Pawn loans are nonrecourse loans collateralized by personal property. We also sell merchandise, primarily collateral forfeited from unpaid loans or goods purchased directly from customers.
We exist to serve our customers’ short-term cash needs, helping them to live and enjoy their lives. We are focused on three strategic pillars: Strengthen the Core Relentless focus on superior execution and operational excellence in our core pawn business Cost Efficiency and Simplification Shape a culture of cost efficiency through ongoing focus on simplification and optimization Innovate and Grow Broaden customer engagement to service more customers more frequently in more locations Pawn Activities At our pawn stores, we advance cash against the value of collateralized tangible personal property. We earn pawn service charges (“PSC”) for those cash advances, and the PSC rate varies by state and transaction size. At the time of the transaction, we take possession of the pawned collateral, which consists of tangible personal property, generally jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods or musical instruments. If the customer chooses to redeem their pawn, they will repay the amount advanced plus any accrued PSC. If the customer chooses not to redeem their pawn, the pawned collateral becomes our inventory, which we sell in our retail merchandise sales activities or, in some cases, scrap for its inherent gold or precious stone content. Consequently, the success of our pawn business is largely dependent on our ability to accurately assess the probability of pawn redemption and the estimated resale or scrap value of the collateralized personal property. Our ability to offer quality second-hand goods at prices significantly lower than original retail prices attracts value-conscious customers. The gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the estimated resale or scrap value at the time the property is either accepted as pawn collateral or purchased and our ability to sell that merchandise in a timely manner. As a significant portion of our inventory and sales involve gold and jewelry, our results can be influenced by the market price of gold and diamonds. Growth and Expansion Our strategy is to expand the number of locations we operate through opening new (“de novo”) locations and through acquisitions and investments in both Latin America, the United States and potential new markets. Our ability to open de novo stores, acquire new stores and make other related investments is dependent on several variables, such as projected achievement of internal investment hurdles, the availability of acceptable sites or acquisition candidates, the alignment of acquirer/seller price expectations, the regulatory environment, local zoning ordinances, access to capital and the availability of qualified personnel.
Seasonality and Quarterly Results In the United States, PSC is historically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter (July through September) due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season.
PSC is historically lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June) following the tax refund season and merchandise sales are highest in our first and second fiscal quarters (October through March) due to the holiday season, jewelry sales
20 Table of Contents surrounding Valentine’s Day and the availability of tax refunds. In Latin America, most of our customers receive additional compensation from their employers in December, and many receive additional compensation in June or July, applying downward pressure on loan balances and fueling some merchandise sales in those periods. As a net effect of these and other factors and excluding discrete charges, our consolidated income/loss before tax is generally highest in our first fiscal quarter (October through December) and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June). Financial Highlights We remain focused on optimizing our balance of pawn loans outstanding (“PLO”) and the resulting higher PSC. The following chart presents sources of gross profit, including PSC, merchandise sales gross profit ("Merchandise sales GP") and jewelry scrapping gross profit ("Jewelry Scrapping GP") for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: The following chart presents sources of gross profit by geographic disbursement for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 21 Table of Contents Business Developments Convertible Debt In December 2022, we issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029 (the “2029 Convertible Notes”). In conjunction with the issuance of the 2029 Convertible Notes, we extinguished approximately $109.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Convertible Notes for approximately $117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately $69.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately $62.9 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we used approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase 578,703 shares of our Class A common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. See Note 7 of Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Part I, Item 1 — Financial Statements."
Investment in Cash Converters International
On November 2, 2022, we purchased an additional 13 million shares of Cash Converters for $2.1 million. This purchase increased our total ownership in Cash Converters to 273,939,157 shares, representing a 43.7% ownership interest. Additionally, during November 2022, we received a cash dividend of $1.8 million from Cash Converters. Founders
During December 2022, we made additional investments in Founders One, LLC ("Founders") in the form of a $15.0 million additional capital contribution and a $15.0 million loan. The proceeds of these additional investments were passed on to Simple Management Group, Inc. ("SMG") and used by SMG to complete the acquisition of FFI Holdings, Inc. SMG owns and operates 73 pawn stores in the Caribbean and Florida.

Results of Operations Non-GAAP Constant Currency and Same Store Financial Information To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain other non-GAAP financial information on a constant currency basis ("constant currency") and "same store" basis. We use constant currency results to evaluate our Latin America Pawn operations, which are denominated primarily in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and other Latin American currencies.
We analyze results on a same store basis (which is defined as stores open during the entirety of the comparable periods) to better understand existing store performance without the influence of increases or decreases resulting solely from changes in store count.
We believe presentation of constant currency and same store results is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our Latin America Pawn operations and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a better understanding and evaluation of factors and trends affecting our business. We provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. We use this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate and compare operating results across accounting periods. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not rather than or superior to, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations items denominated in local currency to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, we have an equity method investment that is denominated in Australian dollars and is translated into U.S. dollars. We used the end-of-period rate for balance sheet items and the average closing daily exchange rate on a monthly basis during the appropriate period for statement of operations items. Our statement of operations constant currency results reflect the monthly exchange rate fluctuations and are not directly calculable from the rates below. Constant currency results, where presented, also exclude the foreign currency gain or loss. The end-of-period and approximate average exchange rates for each applicable currency as compared to U.S. dollars as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows: 22 Table of Contents December 31, Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Mexican peso 19.5  20.5  19.7  20.7  Guatemalan quetzal 7.7  7.5  7.7  7.6  Honduran lempira 24.4  24.1  24.3  23.9  Australian dollar 1.5  1.4  1.5  1.4  Operating Results Segments We manage our business and report our financial results in three reportable segments;

PLO ended the quarter at $166.9 million, up 18% (15% on a same store basis).
Total revenue was up 19%, and gross profit increased 13%, driven by increased pawn service charges, higher merchandise sales and improved merchandise sales gross profit. PSC increased 23% as a result of higher average PLO. Merchandise sales gross margin decreased to 38% from 43%, reflecting a more normalized operating environment. Store expenses increased 13% primarily due to increased labor in-line with store activity and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our loyalty program and rent associated with lease renewals. Segment contribution increased 14% to $39.3 million, due to the changes noted above. Segment store count increased by 10 stores during this quarter due to two acquisitions. 24 Table of Contents Latin America Pawn

Store expenses increased 25% (20% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to increased labor in-line with store activity and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our loyalty program and rent associated with lease renewals.
Same-store expenses increased 22% (18% on a constant currency basis).
Segment contribution increased 16% (15% on a constant currency basis) to $7.5 million, due to the changes noted above.
Segment store count increased by one store due to the net impact of opening two de novo stores and the consolidation of one store during the quarter.

Segment contribution increased $6.3 million or 15% over the prior year quarter primarily due to the improved operating results of the segments above.
In December 2022, the Company repurchased approximately $109.4 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2024 for approximately $117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately $69.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 for approximately $62.9 million plus accrued interest and recorded a $3.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Income tax expense increased $2.1 million primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes of $3.2 million this quarter compared to the prior year quarter as well as the non-deductible loss on the convertible debt refinancing. Income tax expense includes other items that do not necessarily correspond to pre-tax earnings and create volatility in our effective tax rate. These items include the net effect of state taxes, non-deductible items and changes in valuation allowances for certain foreign operations. See Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 Note 11: Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplemental Data” for quantification of these items. Liquidity and Capital Resources We currently believe that, based on available capital resources and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs, currently anticipated capital expenditures, currently anticipated business growth and expansion, tax payments, and current and projected debt service requirements. Cash and Cash Equivalents Our cash and equivalents balance was $207.7 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $206.0 million at September 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. 27 Table of Contents Cash Flows The table and discussion below presents a summary of the selected sources and uses of our cash:   Three Months Ended December 31, Percentage Change (in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,668  $ 9,018  29% Net cash used in investing activities (44,618) (30,603) 46% Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities
33,993  (792) * Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 605  719  (16)% Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,648  $ (21,658) (108)% * Represents a percentage computation that is not mathematically meaningful. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities year-over-year was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital primarily related to the timing of payments of accounts payable, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in net income and a higher change in the provision for inventory reserve.
The $14.0 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities year-over-year was primarily due to $26.5 million higher outgoing cash flows used to fund acquisitions and strategic investments, and an increase of $9.0 million in net pawn lending, partially offset by an $22.7 million increase in the sale of forfeited collateral. Of the $26.5 million used to fund other investments, the largest amount is $15.0 million related to a note receivable from Founders, as discussed in Note 5: Strategic Investments in Part I, Item 1 - Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The $34.8 million increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily related to the December 2022 financing of the 2029 Convertible Notes, in which we issued $230.0 million (less issuance costs) principal amount of 3.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029 offset by the extinguishment of approximately $109.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Convertible Notes for approximately $117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately $69.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately $62.9 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we used approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase 578,703 shares of our Class A common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. The net effect of these changes was a $1.6 million increase in cash on hand during the current year to date period, resulting in a $216.0 million ending cash and restricted cash balance.
Sources and Uses of Cash In December 2022, we issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Convertible Notes. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2029 Convertible Notes, we extinguished approximately $109.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Convertible Notes for approximately $117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately $69.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately $62.9 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we used approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase 578,703 shares of our Class A common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. See Note 7 of Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Part I, Item 1 — Financial Statements." On May 3, 2022, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of our Class A Common Stock over three years. As of December 31, 2022, we have repurchased 481,005 shares of our Class A Common Stock under the program for $4.1 million. Execution of the program will be responsive to fluctuating market conditions and valuations, liquidity needs and the expected return on investment compared to other opportunities. Under the stock repurchase program, we may purchase Class A Non-Voting common stock from time to time at management’s discretion in accordance with applicable securities laws, including through open market transactions, block or privately negotiated transactions, or any combination thereof. In addition, we may purchase shares pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 28 Table of Contents The amount and timing of purchases will be dependent on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, general market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements, general business conditions, the level of cash flows, and corporate considerations determined by management and the Board, such as liquidity and capital needs and the availability of attractive alternative investment opportunities. The Board of Directors has reserved the right to modify, suspend or terminate the program at any time. See Note 8 of Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Part I, Item 1 — Financial Statements." We anticipate that cash flows from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to fund any future stock repurchases, strategic investments, our contractual
obligations, planned de novo store growth, capital expenditures and working capital requirements through fiscal 2023. We continue to explore acquisition opportunities, both large and small, and may choose to pursue additional debt, equity or equity-linked financings in the future should the need arise.
Depending on the level of acquisition activity and other factors, our ability to repay our longer-term debt obligations, including the convertible debt maturing in 2024, 2025 and 2029, may require us to refinance these obligations through the issuance of new debt securities, equity securities, convertible securities or through new credit facilities. Contractual Obligations In "Part II, Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, we reported that we had $608.0 million in total contractual obligations as of September 30, 2022. There have been no material changes to this total obligation since September 30, 2022, other than the convertible debt refinancing and lease liabilities changes as further discussed in Note 7: Debt and Note 4: Leases, respectively, of Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Part I, Item 1 — Financial Statements." We are responsible for the maintenance, property taxes and insurance at most of our locations. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, these collectively amounted to $15.2 million. Recently Adopted Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements We reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Risks and Uncertainties that May Affect Future Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created by these laws. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made with words or phrases like "may," "should," "could," "will," "predict," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "projection" and similar expressions. Such statements are only predictions of the outcome and timing of future events based on our current expectations and currently available information and, accordingly, are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not regard any forward-looking statements as a representation that the expected results will be achieved. Important risk factors that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations are identified and described in
"Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30,
2022 and "Part II, Item 1A — Risk Factors" of this Report. We specifically disclaim any responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward-looking statement except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, gold values and foreign currency exchange rates, and are described in detail in "Part II, Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. There have been no material changes in our reported market risks or risk management policies since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES This report includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Internal Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. PART II — OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See Note 9: Contingencies of Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Part I, Item 1 — Financial Statements." ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Important risk factors that could affect our operations and financial performance, or that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations, are described in
"Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for
the year ended September 30,
2022, as supplemented by the information set forth below. A recent law change in Australia could adversely impact Cash Converters’ business In December 2022, the Australian Parliament passed the Financial Sector Reform Bill 2022, which establishes lending limits on small amount credit contracts. The bill becomes effective in June 2023, and could adversely impact the financial position or results of operations of Cash Converters, in which the Company has an equity investment.
We cannot estimate the financial effect that this bill may have on our investment at this time. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 2.
