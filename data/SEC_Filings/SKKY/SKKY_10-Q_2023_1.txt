The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year end October 31, 2022 as reported on Form 10-K, have been omitted.   NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the manner of presentation in the current period.

Thomas, and Benford Consultancy, a corporation owned by our COO and a member of our Board of Directors, Paul Benford, own, respectively,
72.34 % and
27.66 % of the issued and outstanding shares of Real Innovations International LLC, (“Real Innovations”) a corporation organized under the laws of Nevis, West Indies. In March 2012, Cogent, our operating subsidiary, assigned all of its intellectual property including the pending patent applications for its real-time data transmission and display technology (the “IP”) to Real Innovations under an assignment of intellectual property agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”). In return for the assignment Real Innovations required a one-time payment of $ 30,000
to Cogent. Cogent elected to forgo the payment allowing Real Innovations to offset future expenses against the payment. There is no ongoing royalty payment or other form of compensation from Real Innovations to Cogent under the Assignment Agreement.
Real Innovations, in turn, entered into a master intellectual property license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Cogent for all of the same IP. Under the License Agreement Real Innovations granted a royalty-free license in perpetuity to Cogent for the use and exploitation of the IP in return for which Cogent agreed to: (i) pay all operating expenses of Real Innovations incurred in connection with the continued prosecution of pending patent applications and others that may be prepared; (ii) prosecute all claims for infringement of the IP; (iii) defend and indemnify Real Innovations from and against all claims of infringement of the IP asserted by third parties against Real Innovations, Cogent or our Company; (iv) purchase liability insurance in favor of Real Innovations for this purpose. Under the termination provision of the licenses agreement, there is no unilateral right of termination. Termination may occur by mutual consent of the parities, the Company ceasing doing business, by breach by the Company or by the Company failing to maintain the license and the support to prosecute and protect the license under applicable laws.   Under the License Agreement, Messrs. Andrew S. Thomas and Paul Benford will benefit indirectly from their indirect ownership of all of the shares of Real Innovations to the extent of any such payments or other undertakings by Cogent on behalf of Real Innovations, but the exact amount of these benefits cannot be determined at this time. No payments have been made as of January 31, 2023.   As of January 31, 2023, the amount due related parties was $ 97,056
compared to $ 115,475
as of October 31, 2022.   NOTE 5- OPTIONS   The Company, under its 2012 Stock Option Plan, issues options to various officers, directors, and consultants.

Revenue increased for the three month period ended January 31, 2023 over the same period in 2022 by 3.1%.  The increase in revenue for the three month period ended January 31, 2023 is attributed to higher sales by Cogent. The Company is benefiting from its prior investment in sales and marketing and market recognition which has contributed to the increase in Cogent’s sales.   General and administrative expense was $625,964 for the three month period ended January 31, 2023 compared to $577,290 for the same period in 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three month period ended January 31, 2023 over the same period in 2022, resulted from increased expenditures primarily in salaries and payroll of $12,197, Advertising of $7,696, and other general and administrative of $25,873.   For the three month period ended January 31, 2023, the Company reported an operating loss of $133,845 compared to operating loss of $100,111 for the same periods in 2022. The increase of operating loss during the three month period ended January 31, 2023 over the same period in 2022 is attributable to higher marketing. consulting and general and administrative costs in the period ended January 31, 2023 as  compared to the same period in 2022.   Other income and expense for the three month period ended January 31, 2023, was other expense of $13,261 compared to other income of $25,947 for the same periods in 2022.

The higher net loss for the three month period in 2023 can be attributed to  higher operating expenses in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue increased in the three months period ending January 31, 2023 over the same period in 2022  but was not significant  enough to offset the increase in expenses in that period.   Net loss to common shareholders was $150,111 for the three month period ended January 31, 2023 compared to $77,069 for the same period in 2022.

12 Table of Contents   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework- 2013. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We lack full time personnel in accounting and financial staff to sufficiently monitor and process financial transactions in an efficient and timely manner. Our history of losses has severely limited our budget to hire and train enough accounting and financial personnel needed to adequately provide this function. Consequently, we lacked sufficient technical expertise, reporting standards and written policies and procedures along with a lack of a formal review process which includes multiple layers of review. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   Our management believes that the Unaudited Financial Statements included herein present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.     13 Table of Contents   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
