DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
SensaSure Technologies, Inc. (“SensaSure”
or “Company”) was incorporated on September 8, 2020 under the laws of the State of Nevada with an authorized share capital
of
250,000,000
common shares,
5,000,000
of Class A and
5,000,000
Class B preferred shares. The Company did not issue any number of common
shares, Class A and Class B preferred shares before December 21, 2020.
Sensa Bues AB (“Sensa Bues”) was incorporated
in the Kingdom of Sweden in November 2009. Sensa Bues AB owns the core intellectual properties for the design of sample collection devices
and the methodologies to collect, extract and detect the non-volatile substances presented within aerosols in exhaled breath. These aerosols,
which originate from the lungs and blood, are captured using electret-based filter technologies.  This non-invasive breath-based
biological sample collection and testing methodology is called ExaBreath (“EB”) technology.
Sensa Bues AB performs medical device design and
research focusing on developing and commercializing EB for disease detection, exposure monitoring, and drug metabolism.
On December 21, 2020,
the Company completed a
reverse recapitalization via a share exchange agreement with Sensa Bues AB and the shareholders who owned 270,339 common shares that represented
72.82% of the total issued and outstanding common shares in Sensa Bues AB. Under the share exchange agreement, the shareholders of Sensa
Bues AB, agreed to exchange their shares of Sensa Bues AB for common shares of SensaSure at an exchange ratio of approximate 1:49.99.
Pursuant to the share exchange transactions (see share exchange agreement noted above), SensaSure issued a total of 13,515,183 common
shares and the then-shareholders of Sensa Bues AB hold their ownership of Sensa Bues AB through SensaSure (Note 8 (b)). Upon completion
of the share exchange transaction, SensaSure became the controlling shareholder that owned 74.82% the total issued and outstanding common
shares in Sensa Bues AB and parent company of Sensa Bues AB (“Subsidiary”).
No goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded
during the reverse capitalization. As noted earlier, this transaction has been accounted for as a reversed recapitalization, the operating
results included in this discussion reflect the historical operating results of Sensa Bues AB prior to the reverse capitalization transaction.
During April 2021, the Company increased its ownership
interest in Sensa Bues AB pursuant to private placements completed by Sensa Bues AB where
277,296
common shares and
93,032
common shares
were issued to the Company and noncontrolling interests respectively. (Note 8 (b)).
During the three months ended July 31, 2022, the
Company increased its ownership interest in Sensa Bues AB pursuant to private placements completed by Sensa Bues AB where
2,200,000
common
shares and
440
common shares were issued to the Company and noncontrolling interests respectively.
On April 30, 2022, the Company owned
74 % ( 74 %
- April 30, 2021) of the total issued and outstanding common shares in Sensa Bues AB (Note 8 (c)).
On January 31, 2023, the Company owned
93.53 %
( 74 % - April 30, 2022) of the total issued and outstanding common shares in Sensa Bues AB (Note 8 (c)).

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, MEASUREMENT AND CONSOLIDATION
(a)
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”)
for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated
financial statements for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 and their accompanying notes.
The accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated
financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (“USD”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations for the interim
periods presented have been reflected herein. Operating results for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending April 30, 2023. The Company’s fiscal year-end is April 30.
The unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its less than wholly owned subsidiary, Sensa Bues AB. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.

(b)
Basis of Consolidation
Sensa Bues AB and SensaSure were deemed to be
under common control. Accordingly, the combination of the two entities has been accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common
control in accordance with ASC 805 guidelines, whereby the resulting controlling entity, namely, SensaSure recognized the assets and liabilities
of the Sensa Bues AB transferred at their carrying amounts with a carry-over basis. The reorganization of entities under common control
was retrospectively applied to the financial statements of all prior periods when the financial statements are issued for a period that
includes the date the share exchange transaction occurred.
Equity interests in Sensa Bues AB held by parties
other than SensaSure are presented as non-controlling interests in equity.
(c)
Liquidity and going concern
The Company is in the early stages of commercializing
its product and in the process of its initial public offering. It is concurrently in development mode, operating research and development
programs in order to develop an ecosystem of technologies and commercialize other proposed products. The Company has incurred recurring
losses from operations, and as at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $ 5,797,777
and $ 4,433,352
respectively,
a working capital deficiency of $ 839,338
and $ 445,270
respectively. The Company, during year ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021,
through several private placements, raised $ 368,200
and $ 893,014
respectively (Note 8 (b)). On March 30, 2021, Sensa Bues AB, through
an agreement with a vendor that is controlled by a then-director of Sensa Bues AB, modified the payment term of payable balance in the
amount of $ 333,744
to settle the payable balance in seven installments (Note 7 (c)). During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company,
Sensa Bues AB and a director of the Company reached an agreement to settle account payable in the amount of $ 326,337
by issuing options
to purchase common shares of Sensa Bues AB with a guarantee of subscription of the Company’s common shares upon exercise of the
option by the optionee (Note 7 (a) and Note 8 (b)).
The Company’s operating plan is predicated
on a variety of assumptions including, but not limited to, the level of product demand, cost estimates, its ability to continue to raise
additional financing and the state of the general economic environment in which the Company operates. There can be no assurance that these
assumptions will prove to be accurate in all material respects, or that the Company will be able to successfully execute its operating
plan. In the absence of additional appropriate financing, the Company may have to modify its operating plan or slow down the pace of development
and commercialization of its proposed products.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s
ability to meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until
sufficient sources of recurring revenues can be generated.
These unaudited condensed interim consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company expects to finance their future operations
primarily through cash flow from capital contributions from the shareholders of the Company. In the event that the Company requires additional
funding to finance the growth of the Company’s current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic objectives,
the shareholders of the Company indicated the intent and ability to provide additional equity financing.
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
(COVID-19) emerged. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy,
it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally.
During 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, as a result
of COVID-19 infections having been reported throughout both the United States and Sweden, certain national, provincial, state and local
governmental issued proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Due to the disruption of the COVID-19
crisis, the Company’s business activities might be subject to certain level of adverse impact. At the date of approval of these
consolidated financial statements, it is still not possible to reliably estimate the effect of these developments as well as the impact
on the financial results and condition of the Company in future periods. Management is monitoring these developments on the Company’s
operations and is taking all steps to ensure that employees are following all public health and safety protocols.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a)
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) on May 1, 2018. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue
is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by applying the core principles – 1) identify the contract with a
customer, 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price
to performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company sells devices with collection mechanism
for biological samples based upon exhaled breath. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of devices (at a point in time). In order to recognize
revenue, management considers whether or not the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a commercial arrangement exists, price
is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred.
(b)
Cash and restricted cash held in trust
Cash includes cash on hand and balances with banks.
Restricted cash includes proceeds from private placements completed by the Company during years ended April 30, 2021 and 2022 that are
held in an escrow account. As per the share subscription agreements, and the Escrow Agreement dated January 26, 2021, restricted cash
can only be used for expenses related to listing process and for professional expenses of the first eighteen months’ statutory filings
from the date the Company successfully completes the listing process.
(c)
Non-controlling interests
The non-controlling interests represent the portion
of the equity (net assets) in the subsidiary not directly or indirectly attributable to the Company. Non-controlling interests are presented
as a separate component of equity on the condensed interim consolidated balance sheets, statements of loss, statements of comprehensive
loss and statements of stockholders’ deficiency attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests.
(d)
Critical management judgment and use of estimates
The preparation of the condensed interim consolidated
financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Areas involving significant estimates and assumptions include: deferred
income tax assets and related valuation allowance, accruals, stock options, principles of consolidation and reverse recapitalization and
assumptions used in the going concern assessment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically,
and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known.
(e)
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable consists of amounts due to
the Company from research institutions. Accounts receivable is reported on the balance sheets net of an estimated allowance for doubtful
accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible receivables based on historical experience,
assessment of specific risk, review of outstanding invoices, and various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, and recognizes the provision as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Uncollectible accounts
are written off against the allowance after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted and when it is deemed that a balance is
uncollectible.

(f)
Research and development
Research and development and patent related expenses are charged to
operations as incurred.
(g)
Stock based compensation
The Company accounts for share-based payments
in accordance with the provision of ASC 718, which requires that all share-based payments issued to acquire and compensate for goods or
services received, including grants of employee shares, be recognized in the condensed interim consolidated statement of loss based on
their fair values, net of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation expense related to share-based awards is recognized
over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments
issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company issues compensatory shares for services including,
but not limited to, executive, management, operations, corporate communication, finance and administrative consulting services.
(h)
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company’s
Swedish-based subsidiary is the Swedish Krona (“SEK”) and the US-based parent is the U.S. dollar (“USD”). Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of the
transaction. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net loss for
the reporting period. In translating the financial statements of the Company’s Swedish subsidiary from their functional currency
into the Company’s reporting currency of USD, condensed interim consolidated balance sheet accounts are translated using the closing
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate prevailing
during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation, if any, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss
in equity. The Company has not, to the date of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments
to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
(i)
Fair Value of financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist
primarily of cash and restricted cash held in trust, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
demand loans, loans from related parties, amounts due to related parties. The carrying amounts of these balances approximate their fair
values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying value of long term payable to a related party approximates
its fair values due to current market rate on such debt.
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair
value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10
also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
●
Level 1 – Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2 – Valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 3 – Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring management’s best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value.

SENSASURE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY
31, 2023 AND 2022
(continued)
In instances where the determination of the fair
value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which
the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment,
and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based
upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet
financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments or interest rates that are comparable
to market rates. These financial instruments include cash and restricted cash held in trust, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, demand loans, loans from related parties, amounts due to related parties and long term payable to a related
party. The Company’s cash and restricted cash held in trust, which is carried at fair values, is classified as a Level 1. The Company’s
bank accounts are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.
(j)
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed under the asset and
liability method reflecting both current and deferred taxes, which reflect the tax impact of all events included in the financial statements.
The balance sheet approach (i) reflects a current tax liability or asset recognized for estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns
for the current and prior years, (ii) reflects a deferred tax liability or asset recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable
to temporary differences and carryforwards, (iii) measures current and deferred tax liabilities and assets using the enacted tax rate
of which the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated, and (iv) reduces deferred tax assets, if necessary, by
the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and
a measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets only to the extent that management concludes these assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized.
Significant judgement is required in assessing and estimating the more-likely-than-not tax consequences of the events included in the
financial statements. Management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary
differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The Company recognizes accrued
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. Eos records uncertain tax positions in accordance
with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (i) management determines whether it is more likely- than-not that the tax position
will be sustained on the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more likely-than-not recognition
threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement
with the related tax authority.
(k)
Loss per share
The Company has adopted the Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 260-10 which provides for calculation
of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed
by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. Diluted
earnings per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially dilutive shares
outstanding as at January 31, 2023 and 2022.
(l)
Operating Segments
Operating segments are components of an enterprise
about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding
how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. All revenues are currently earned in Sweden and significantly all of the assets
of the Company are used for the Company’s medical device design and research and distribution activities that is carried out in
Sweden. The Company has one reportable segment and operating segment: Medical device design and research and distribution.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This pronouncement, along with
subsequent ASUs issued to clarify provisions of ASU 2016-13, changes the impairment model for most financial assets and will require the
use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be required to
estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial
asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In developing the estimate for lifetime
expected credit loss, entities must incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This
pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. On
November 19, 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), finalized various effective
date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying the credit losses (CECL),
the revised effective date is January 2023.
In July 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-07, Codification
Updates to SEC Sections. This ASU amends various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10532, Disclosure
Update and Simplification, and Nos. 33-10231 and 33-10442, Investment Company Reporting Modernization. One of the changes in the ASU requires
a presentation of changes in stockholders’ equity in the form of a reconciliation, either as a separate financial statement or in
the notes to the financial statements, for the current and comparative year-to-date interim periods. The Company presented changes in
stockholders’ equity as separate financial statements for the current and comparative year-to-date interim periods beginning on
April 1, 2019. The additional elements of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated
financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12,
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates
certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting
entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Most amendments within the standard are required
to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The
Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the provisions of ASU 2019-12 on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2030-20
Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments, An Amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification: a)in ASU No. 2016-01,
b) in Subtopic 820-10, c) for depository and lending institutions clarification in disclosure requirements, d) in Subtopic 470-50, e)
in Subtopic 820-10, f) Interaction of Topic 842 and Topic 326, g) Interaction of the guidance in Topic 326 and Subtopic 860-20.The amendments
in this Update represent changes to clarify or improve the Codification. The amendments make the Codification easier to understand and
easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. For public business entities updates under the following
paragraphs: a), b), d) and e) are effective upon issuance of this final update. The effective date for c) is for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has adopted this ASU for the year ended April
30, 2021.
In April 2021, The FASB issued ASU 2021-04 to
codify the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on how an issuer should account for modifications made to
equity-classified written call options (hereafter referred to as a warrant to purchase the issuer’s common stock). The guidance
in the ASU requires the issuer to treat a modification of an equity-classified warrant that does not cause the warrant to become liability-classified
as an exchange of the original warrant for a new warrant. This guidance applies whether the modification is structured as an amendment
to the terms and conditions of the warrant or as termination of the original warrant and issuance of a new warrant. The Company does not
expect that the new guidance will significantly impact its condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

On December 1, 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) processed a Form 211 relating to the initiation of priced quotations of the Company’s common stock, under the
ticker symbol “SSTC,” which means that the submitting broker-dealer has demonstrated to FINRA compliance with FINRA Rule 6432
and therefore has met the requirements under that rule to initiate a quotation for SSTC within four days of December 1, 2022. FINRA’s
processing of a Form 211 in no way constitutes FINRA’s approval of the common stock, the Company, or the Company’ business, and
relates solely to the submitting broker-dealer’s obligation to comply with FINRA Rule 6432 and SEA Rule 15c2-11 when quoting a security.
The company continued its plan to obtain regulatory approval for trading in the OTC market and the Company was approved to be upgraded
to the OTCQB by OTC Markets on February 24, 2023.

Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We have based these
forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject
to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,”
“should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “continue,” or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or
contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) filings.
Overview
SensaSure is a medical technology
or “MedTech”, company supplying a simple device and method to collect a breath sample for lab-based analysis. Exhaled breath
contains aerosols which originate from the lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for analytics, diagnostics, and
therapeutics. SensaSure’s patented method is called ExaBreath (EB) and it can collect, extract, detect and identify non-volatile
compounds present in every exhaled breath by utilizing existing lab-based testing infrastructure and procedures. EB is applicable in toxicology,
pharmacology, and clinical biochemistry. We have not applied for, nor has our EB device received approval from any government agency in
the European Union or from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We can provide no assurance that any government
regulatory body will clear our EB device for commercial use.
We believe EB may enhance
the overall user experience in a wide range of applications and markets such as workplace drug testing, anti-doping in sport, law enforcement,
e-health, and telemedicine. In the case of anti-doping, EB may reduce the time, cost, and overall burden that drug programs place on athletes,
other participants, and the wider stakeholders such as leagues and associations. EB may improve the user experience for both donors and
collectors during sample collection process.
Drug control programs represent
significant market segments due to the necessity of testing in most sports, industries, law enforcement agencies, ministries, police forces,
criminal justice systems and by many employers for the insurance industry.
We believe that our business
model will follow a methodology to try to reduce risks, including transferring the manufacturing costs to third parties to reduce capital
investment which we hope will provide relatively higher margin business based upon our EB collection device to improve user acceptability
and analytical credibility in areas such as anti-doping in sport. We expect that this will increase the credibility and perceived value
of doping control programs resulting in a stronger deterrence factor and better protection for the integrity of sport.
The global device market
in drug testing is estimated to be nearly $4.5 billion in 2020 and is estimated to reach $10 billion by 2025 (According to BCC Research,
Drug Testing Market Report 2019). The estimates provided here are based on varying estimates from research companies and actual numbers
may vary significantly. While there are several basic types of drug tests, the most common method is urine testing.
We continue to work with
our lab partners to expand the applicability of our product across a wide range of market segments. There are ongoing as well as follow-on
studies in the areas of SARS-CoV-2 testing, biomarker discovery, cannabis testing, and anti-doping in sport. Our lab partner in the field
of cannabis testing, RCU Labs (Roseville, CA), had a recent technical paper published in Nature. The paper’s title is “A comprehensive
breath test that confirms recent use of inhaled cannabis within the impairment window.” RCU Labs’ methodology uses SensaSure’s
device and breath collection technology as part of their test. This type of test is needed by law enforcement agencies and employers worldwide.
Our lab partner in anti-doping
(German Sports University, Cologne, Germany), had a technical paper published entitled “Probing for factors influencing exhaled
breath drug testing in sports - pilot studies focusing on the tested individual’s tobacco smoking habit and sex.” This study
used SensaSure’s device and adds further data in support of our product’s suitability and applicability in the field of anti-doping
testing in sport.
We continue to expand our
IP portfolio with an important patent in Brazil now granted. This patent is for a “Portable sampling device and method for drug
testing from exhaled breath.” This brings our IP portfolio to a total of 111 granted patents.

Current Challenges
The current challenges facing
the drug testing industry are many and varied. Increasing the overall effectiveness and accuracy of the drug control program remains a
priority. However, reducing the burden imposed upon participants in terms of time, cost, inconvenience, and intrusiveness are also important.
Our intent is to significantly
improve the user experience for donors and collectors during the sample collection process as well as simplify and reduce the costs of
sample preparation, packaging, and transportation to the labs. The EB method may lead to improved overall detection accuracy thus reducing
the incidence of false positives and to avoid legal outcomes.
Our EB device is quick to
use and may provide more predictable sample collection times to enable more samples to be planned and collected. The EB device can enable
new sample collection formats and work patterns (i.e., youth testing, remote collection, and monitoring by video). We believe our EB device
may fulfill the unmet analytical need for a recent cannabis use and impairment test. The EB device provides a solution platform that is
flexible and responsive in a wide range of applications.
Our Solution
We are in an omics revolution,
and breathomics is anticipated to offer one of the most significant opportunities to healthcare. SensaSure owns what we believe may be
a low cost and transformative breath-based technology. EB may have the potential to:
1
ensure cleaner sports competition
2
help to make schools, roads, and workplaces safer
3
facilitate the detection and diagnosis of diseases earlier
Exhaled breath contains aerosols
which originate from lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for diagnostics, therapeutics, and analytics. SensaSure
owns the core IP for the design of a collection device as well as the methodology to collect, extract and detect the non-volatile substances
present within these aerosols using a simple electret-based filter technology. This technology called ExaBreath (EB) is intended to offer
an alternative to blood, urine and oral fluid collection processes in many situations.
SensaSure’s testing
methodology is a non-invasive way to collect chemicals in breath, for disease detection, exposure monitoring, and drug metabolism. We
believe that SensaSure’s core technology will be a major asset for medical research, healthcare, law enforcement, workplace drug
testing and professional sports organizations.
Our Products and Ongoing Development
The different methods of
biological sample collection for drug testing are diverse and can be expensive. The data for our device has been collected by universities
and hospitals which provides us with independent research some of which has been published in journals related to drug testing. Our EB
device has four main characteristics:
●
breath offers a new low cost and non-invasive sampling methodology.
●
breath sampling has been found to be an extremely sensitive, back-to-lab based technique, which has been developed into a complete end-to-end analytical platform for use in toxicology, pharmacology and clinical biochemistry that can provide improvements to analyses, diagnostics, and therapies. Independent studies confirm our approach for a back-to-lab technique.
●
EB can detect a wide range of exogenous substances, such as drugs of abuse (narcotics), therapeutic drugs (antibiotics) and performance enhancing drugs used in sports (stimulants) as well as many other compounds.
●
EB can detect a wide range of endogenous substances associated with the study of metabolomics and the determination of biomarkers. These may be used to provide health monitoring and diagnostics support. This may make EB a useful tool for breathomics and biomarker discovery.

with an additional 20 or
more trials ongoing across a range of application specific areas. So far 80 substances have been detected across 25 categories using a
commercial grade electrostatic filter membrane. A great amount of work and effort has been performed in the field of drug testing and
anti-doping through collaborative partnerships with key industry players. Further work is planned to gather validation data and increase
the IP portfolio. Our area of interest has been expanded to include more projects in the field of biomarker discovery.
Since the current distribution
of our product is limited to research organizations, distribution is relatively easy as the product is sent to only a few locations. This
level of business is supported by a large inventory of devices held in a flexible secure storage facility in Stockholm, Sweden. Any large
quantity shipments of product are sent from Sweden. Sample and small quantity shipments are sent from the UK, where a small inventory
is held at the home-office of the CEO. UK based inventory was established to facilitate ongoing operations during COVID-19 lock-down restrictions.
All transportation of the product is done using commercial courier services. All order processing steps, and associated paperwork is handled
internally by the Company’s accountant and management. The current production and delivery system functions well, even throughout
the disruptions to business caused by COVID-19.
In the future, when appropriate,
we will develop a larger scale production and delivery system whereby the processes will be outsourced to a 3 rd  party
specialist manufacturing partner when required. This partner will source the piece parts, manufacture the product then assemble and package
the kits before storing as inventory or drop shipping as order fulfillment. This will be done in a suitably certified facility with the
relevant ISO or other quality control standards that are applicable to the medtech industry. This partner may also be used to provide
all the logistical operations directly with vendors. This could include all order fulfillment requirements including any eventual volume
supply agreements. There are many suitable partners available in the US and Europe who can provide the manufacturing capability as well
as the entire suite of order fulfillment services into the medtech market.
While we believe that, from
a technological and/or medical perspective, there are no material disadvantages to the use of our product in comparison to other commercially
available alternative products. Our product is relatively new, and we currently have limited commercialization, sales and marketing experience.
Our product will compete against alternative products that are well-established and are widely accepted. Many of our competitors are large,
well-capitalized companies such as Abbott Labs, NMS Labs and LabCorp, with significantly greater market share and resources than we have.
Our success will depend in part on our ability to increase adoption of our product, expand existing relationships with our potential customers,
obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our product, where necessary. We cannot provide any assurance that our EB device will receive
any regulatory approvals to sell the product commercially.

Why ExaBreath?
We believe that ExaBreath is Safe - Simple - Effective
●
EB testing is suitable for drug testing such as anti-doping in sport.
●
EB is a quick, easy, and non-intrusive collection process.
●
EB is a one-time-use device to prevent cross-contamination.
●
EB is potentially less expensive to collect than some other matrices.
●
Unlike urine, the detection window of EB closely mimics that of blood so EB may be a better indication of recent use, which is likely to cause impairment (driving) or enhancement (sport).
Based upon our research,
we believe that the statements we have made above are accurate. It will be up to regulatory agencies such as the FDA that will conduct
an analysis regarding the accuracy of these statements. We believe that our filing with the FDA will not occur for 3-5 years. There is
no assurance that any regulatory body will approve or clear our EB device for use.
Our Growth Strategy
Our mission is to provide
a safe, effective, low cost, and easy-to-use device to support and improve outcomes for drug testing. We believe the following strategies
will advance our mission and will contribute to our future success and growth.
●
Expand strategic partnership engagements to support future production and distribution systems.
●
Advance our EB device as a common method for collection of samples for drug testing.
●
Grow our specialized sales force across geographies to foster deeper relationships with partners, third party vendors and drive revenue growth.
●
Execute on our business model to expand and build an application specific EB device for the collection of samples for different applications and market sectors.
●
Leverage our EB Technology to develop new products that satisfy significant unmet testing needs such as biomarker discovery.
●
Drive profitability by scaling our business operations to achieve cost
and production efficiencies.
At the present time any partnership that we have
regarding the study of our device is on a study by study basis.  We do not have any specific relationships that require us to perform
any of the functions that are being performed by the independent research organization. As we move forward we will work to develop
strategic relationships that will be beneficial to both parties.  We provide the number of units requested by the research organization
and bill them for the same. We do not provide any services during the clinical or pre-clinical study.
The Opportunity
We are in an omics revolution,
and breathomics (exhaled breath) may offer one of the biggest opportunities to healthcare. SensaSure owns a transformative breath-based
technology that can potentially:
1
detect and diagnose diseases earlier,
2
make roads and workplaces safer, and
3
ensure cleaner sport
4
Exhaled breath contains aerosols
which originate from lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for diagnostics, therapeutics, and analytics. SensaSure
owns the core IP for the design of a collection device and the methodology to collect, extract and detect the non-volatile substances
present within these aerosols using electret-based filter technology. This technology called ExaBreath (EB) may be able to displace blood,
urine, and oral fluid collection processes in certain situations as a more convenient, reliable, and less costly alternative.
SensaSure’s testing
methodology is a non-invasive way to measure chemicals in breath, for disease detection, exposure monitoring, and drug metabolism. Our
core technology could be a major asset for medical research, healthcare, law enforcement, workplace drug testing and professional sport
organizations. Through our subsidiary there are several patents that we hope will protect our device. The table under Intellectual Property/Patents,
below, provides information regarding our patents.
Our EB device has not received
any approval from a government agency in the European Union nor from the FDA. We can provide no assurance that any government regulatory
body will clear our EB device for commercial use.
Intellectual property
Our
success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights,
in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable
patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other
intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also
rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We
seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information
agreements with suppliers, employees, and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, trade secrets and proprietary
information can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets and
proprietary information, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade
secrets and proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
As
of January 31, 2022, we own 4 issued U.S. patents with 2 currently being published and 105 issued foreign patents, relating to our current
EB technology. A complete list of our patents is contained in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
The
term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including
the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application
in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment,
which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent
or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having
an earlier expiration date. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications that we have filed or may file in the future will result
in issued patents, and we can give no assurance that any patents that have issued or might issue in the future will protect our current
or future products, will provide us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.

Critical accounting policies
The unaudited condensed consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”) and are expressed in United States Dollars. Significant accounting policies are summarized below:
(a)
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) on May 1, 2018. In accordance with
ASC 606, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by applying the core principles – 1) identify
the contract with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate
the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company sells devices with collection
mechanism for biological samples based upon exhaled breath. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of devices (at a point in time). In order
to recognize revenue, management considers whether or not the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a commercial arrangement
exists, price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred.
(b)
Cash and restricted cash held in trust
Cash includes cash on hand and balances
with banks. Restricted cash includes proceeds from private placements completed by the Company during years ended April 30, 2021 and 2022
that are held in an escrow account. As per the share subscription agreements, and the Escrow Agreement dated January 26, 2021, restricted
cash can only be used for expenses related to listing process and for professional expenses of the first eighteen months’ statutory
filings from the date the Company successfully completes the listing process.
(c)
Non-controlling interests
The non-controlling interests represent
the portion of the equity (net assets) in the subsidiary not directly or indirectly attributable to the Company. Non-controlling interests
are presented as a separate component of equity on the condensed interim consolidated balance sheets, statements of loss, statements of
comprehensive loss and statements of stockholders’ deficiency attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests.
(d)
Critical management judgment and use of estimates
The preparation of the condensed interim
consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Areas involving significant estimates and assumptions include:
deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance, accruals, stock options, principles of consolidation and reverse recapitalization
and assumptions used in the going concern assessment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically,
and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known.
(e)
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable consists of amounts
due to the Company from research institutions. Accounts receivable is reported on the balance sheets net of an estimated allowance for
doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible receivables based on historical
experience, assessment of specific risk, review of outstanding invoices, and various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, and recognizes the provision as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Uncollectible
accounts are written off against the allowance after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted and when it is deemed that a balance
is uncollectible.
6
(f)
Research and development
Research and development and patent related expenses are
charged to operations as incurred.
(g)
Stock based compensation
The Company accounts for share-based
payments in accordance with the provision of ASC 718, which requires that all share-based payments issued to acquire and compensate for
goods or services received, including grants of employee shares, be recognized in the condensed interim consolidated statement of loss
based on their fair values, net of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised,
if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation expense related to share-based awards
is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the fair value of the services rendered
or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company issues compensatory shares
for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, operations, corporate communication, finance and administrative consulting
services.
(h)
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company’s
Swedish-based subsidiary is the Swedish Krona (“SEK”) and the US-based parent is the U.S. dollar (“USD”). Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of the
transaction. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net loss for
the reporting period. In translating the financial statements of the Company’s Swedish subsidiary from their functional currency
into the Company’s reporting currency of USD, condensed interim consolidated balance sheet accounts are translated using the closing
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate prevailing
during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation, if any, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss
in equity. The Company has not, to the date of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments
to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
(i)
Fair Value of financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments
consist primarily of cash and restricted cash held in trust, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
demand loans, loans from related parties, amounts due to related parties. The carrying amounts of these balances approximate their fair
values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying value of long term payable to a related party approximates
its fair values due to current market rate on such debt.
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
●
Level 1 – Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2 – Valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 3 – Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring management’s best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value.
7
In instances where the determination
of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy
within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Fair value estimates discussed herein
are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective carrying value of certain
on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments or interest rates
that are comparable to market rates. These financial instruments include cash and restricted cash held in trust, accounts receivable,
other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, demand loans, loans from related parties, amounts due to related parties
and long term payable to a related party. The Company’s cash and restricted cash held in trust, which is carried at fair values,
is classified as a Level 1. The Company’s bank accounts are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore,
bear minimal credit risk.
(j)
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed under the
asset and liability method reflecting both current and deferred taxes, which reflect the tax impact of all events included in the financial
statements. The balance sheet approach (i) reflects a current tax liability or asset recognized for estimated taxes payable or refundable
on tax returns for the current and prior years, (ii) reflects a deferred tax liability or asset recognized for the estimated future tax
effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards, (iii) measures current and deferred tax liabilities and assets using
the enacted tax rate of which the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated, and (iv) reduces deferred tax assets,
if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold
and a measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets only to the extent that management concludes these assets are more-likely-than-not
to be realized. Significant judgement is required in assessing and estimating the more-likely-than-not tax consequences of the events
included in the financial statements. Management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of
existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The Company
recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. Eos records uncertain tax
positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (i) management determines whether it is more likely-
than-not that the tax position will be sustained on the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the
more likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely
to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
(k)
Loss per share
The Company has adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 260-10 which provides
for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share includes no dilution
and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an
entity. Diluted earnings per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially
dilutive shares outstanding as at January 31, 2023 and 2022.
(l)
Operating Segments
Operating segments are components of
an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. All revenues are currently earned in Sweden and significantly all
of the assets of the Company are used for the Company’s medical device design and research and distribution activities that is carried
out in Sweden. The Company has one reportable segment and operating segment: Medical device design and research and distribution.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
“Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This pronouncement,
along with subsequent ASUs issued to clarify provisions of ASU 2016-13, changes the impairment model for most financial assets and will
require the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be
required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis
of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In developing the
estimate for lifetime expected credit loss, entities must incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2019. On November 19, 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), finalized various
effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying the credit
losses (CECL), the revised effective date is January 2023.
In July 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-07,
Codification Updates to SEC Sections. This ASU amends various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10532,
Disclosure Update and Simplification, and Nos. 33-10231 and 33-10442, Investment Company Reporting Modernization. One of the changes in
the ASU requires a presentation of changes in stockholders’ equity in the form of a reconciliation, either as a separate financial
statement or in the notes to the financial statements, for the current and comparative year-to-date interim periods. The Company presented
changes in stockholders’ equity as separate financial statements for the current and comparative year-to-date interim periods beginning
on April 1, 2019. The additional elements of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated
financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes,
eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency
among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Most amendments within the standard
are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective
basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the provisions of ASU 2019-12 on its financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2030-20 Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments, An Amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification: a)in ASU No.
2016-01, b) in Subtopic 820-10, c) for depository and lending institutions clarification in disclosure requirements, d) in Subtopic 470-50,
e) in Subtopic 820-10, f) Interaction of Topic 842 and Topic 326, g) Interaction of the guidance in Topic 326 and Subtopic 860-20.The
amendments in this Update represent changes to clarify or improve the Codification. The amendments make the Codification easier to understand
and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. For public business entities updates under the following
paragraphs: a), b), d) and e) are effective upon issuance of this final update. The effective date for c) is for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has adopted this ASU for the year ended April
30, 2021.
In April 2021, The FASB issued ASU
2021-04 to codify the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on how an issuer should account for modifications
made to equity-classified written call options (hereafter referred to as a warrant to purchase the issuer’s common stock). The guidance
in the ASU requires the issuer to treat a modification of an equity-classified warrant that does not cause the warrant to become liability-classified
as an exchange of the original warrant for a new warrant. This guidance applies whether the modification is structured as an amendment
to the terms and conditions of the warrant or as termination of the original warrant and issuance of a new warrant. The Company does not
expect that the new guidance will significantly impact its condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
(a)
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) on May 1, 2018. In accordance with
ASC 606, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by applying the core principles – 1) identify
the contract with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate
the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company sells devices with a collection
mechanism for biological samples based upon exhaled breath. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of devices (at a point in time). In order
to recognize revenue, management considers whether or not the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a commercial arrangement
exists, price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred.

(b)
Cash and restricted cash held in trust
Cash includes cash on hand and balances
with banks. Restricted cash includes proceeds from private placements completed by the Company during years ended April 30, 2021 and 2022
that are held in an escrow account. As per the share subscription agreements from January to April 2021, and the Escrow Agreement dated
January 26, 2021, restricted cash can only be used for expenses related to the listing process and for professional expenses of the first
eighteen months’ statutory filings from the date the Company successfully completes the listing process.
(c)
Non-controlling interests
The non-controlling interests represent
the portion of the equity (net assets) in the subsidiary not directly or indirectly attributable to the Company. Non-controlling interests
are presented as a separate component of equity on the condensed interim consolidated balance sheets, statements of loss, statements of
comprehensive loss and statements of stockholders’ deficiency attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests.
(d)
Critical management judgment and use of estimates
The preparation of the condensed interim
consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Areas involving significant estimates and assumptions include:
deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance, accruals, stock options, principles of consolidation and reverse recapitalization
and assumptions used in the going concern assessment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically,
and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known.
(e)
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable consists of amounts
due to the Company from research institutions. Accounts receivable is reported on the balance sheets net of an estimated allowance for
doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible receivables based on historical
experience, assessment of specific risk, review of outstanding invoices, and various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, and recognizes the provision as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Uncollectible
accounts are written off against the allowance after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted and when it is deemed that a balance
is uncollectible.
(f)
Research and development
Research and development and patent related expenses are
charged to operations as incurred.
(g)
Stock based compensation
The Company accounts for share-based
payments in accordance with the provision of ASC 718, which requires that all share-based payments issued to acquire and compensate for
goods or services received, including grants of employee shares, be recognized in the statement of loss based on their fair values, net
of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation expense related to share-based awards is recognized over the requisite
service period, which is generally the vesting period.
The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the fair value of the services rendered
or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company issues compensatory shares
for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, operations, corporate communication, finance and administrative consulting
services.
(h)
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company’s
Swedish-based subsidiary is the Swedish Krona (“SEK”) and the US-based parent is the U.S. dollar (“USD”). Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of the
transaction. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net loss for
the reporting period. In translating the financial statements of the Company’s Swedish subsidiary from their functional currency
into the Company’s reporting currency of USD, balance sheet accounts are translated using the closing exchange rate in effect at
the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period.
Adjustments resulting from the translation, if any, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity. The Company has not,
to the date of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations.
(i)
Fair Value of financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments
consist primarily of cash and restricted cash held in trust, accounts receivable, subscription receivable, other receivables, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, demand loans, loans from related parties, amounts due to related parties. The carrying amounts of these
balances approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying value of long term payable
to a related party approximates its fair values due to current market rate on such debt.
10
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
●
Level 1 – Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2 – Valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 3 – Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring management’s best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value.
In instances where the determination
of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy
within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Fair value estimates discussed herein
are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective carrying value of certain
on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments or interest rates
that are comparable to market rates. These financial instruments include cash and restricted cash held in trust, accounts receivable,
subscription receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, demand loans, loans from related parties, amounts
due to related parties and long term payable to a related party. The Company’s cash and restricted cash held in trust, which is
carried at fair values, is classified as a Level 1. The Company’s bank accounts are maintained with financial institutions of reputable
credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.
(j)
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed under the
asset and liability method reflecting both current and deferred taxes, which reflect the tax impact of all events included in the financial
statements. The balance sheet approach (i) reflects a current tax liability or asset recognized for estimated taxes payable or refundable
on tax returns for the current and prior years, (ii) reflects a deferred tax liability or asset recognized for the estimated future tax
effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards, (iii) measures current and deferred tax liabilities and assets using
the enacted tax rate of which the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated, and (iv) reduces deferred tax assets,
if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold
and a measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets only to the extent that management concludes these assets are more-likely-than-not
to be realized. Significant judgement is required in assessing and estimating the more-likely-than-not tax consequences of the events
included in the financial statements. Management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of
existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The Company
recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. Eos records uncertain tax
positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (i) management determines whether it is more likely-
than-not that the tax position will be sustained on the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the
more likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely
to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
11
(k)
Loss per share
The Company has adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 260-10 which provides
for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share includes no dilution
and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an
entity. Diluted earnings per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially
dilutive shares outstanding as at January 31, 2023 and 2022.
(l)
Operating Segments
Operating segments are components of
an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. All revenues are currently earned in Sweden and significantly all
of the assets of the Company are used for the Company’s medical device design and research and distribution activities that are
carried out in Sweden. The Company has one reportable segment and operating segment: Medical device design and research and distribution.
(m)
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
“Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This pronouncement,
along with subsequent ASUs issued to clarify provisions of ASU 2016-13, changes the impairment model for most financial assets and will
require the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be
required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis
of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In developing the
estimate for lifetime expected credit loss, entities must incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2019. On November 19, 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), finalized various
effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying the credit
losses (CECL), the revised effective date is January 2023.
In July 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-07,
Codification Updates to SEC Sections. This ASU amends various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10532,
Disclosure Update and Simplification, and Nos. 33-10231 and 33-10442, Investment Company Reporting Modernization. One of the changes in
the ASU requires a presentation of changes in stockholders’ equity in the form of a reconciliation, either as a separate financial
statement or in the notes to the financial statements, for the current and comparative year-to-date interim periods. The Company presented
changes in stockholders’ equity as separate financial statements for the current and comparative year-to-date interim periods beginning
on April 1, 2019. The additional elements of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated
financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes,
eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency
among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Most amendments within the standard
are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective
basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the provisions of ASU 2019-12 on its financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows.
12
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2030-20 Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments, An Amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification: a)in ASU No.
2016-01, b) in Subtopic 820-10, c) for depository and lending institutions clarification in disclosure requirements, d) in Subtopic 470-50,
e) in Subtopic 820-10, f) Interaction of Topic 842 and Topic 326, g) Interaction of the guidance in Topic 326 and Subtopic 860-20.The
amendments in this Update represent changes to clarify or improve the Codification. The amendments make the Codification easier to understand
and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. For public business entities updates under the following
paragraphs: a), b), d) and e) are effective upon issuance of this final update. The effective date for c) is for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has adopted this ASU for the year ended April
30, 2021.
In April 2021, The FASB issued ASU
2021-04 to codify the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on how an issuer should account for modifications
made to equity-classified written call options (hereafter referred to as a warrant to purchase the issuer’s common stock). The guidance
in the ASU requires the issuer to treat a modification of an equity-classified warrant that does not cause the warrant to become liability-classified
as an exchange of the original warrant for a new warrant. This guidance applies whether the modification is structured as an amendment
to the terms and conditions of the warrant or as termination of the original warrant and issuance of a new warrant. The Company does not
expect that the new guidance will significantly impact its condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
Results of Operations
Consolidated Financial Position
As of January 31, 2023 we
have Total Assets of $68,541 compared to $439,645 at April 30, 2022. The decrease of $371,104 during the nine month period is due primarily
to the decrease in our cash and restricted cash held in trust of $375,820. Our Total Assets consist of Current Assets only.
Our Current Liabilities at
January 31, 2023 are $907,879 compared to $902,850 at April 30, 2022. The increase in our current liabilities of $5,029 is mainly attributed
to increase in amount due to related parties (see note 7a and 7b of interim condensed consolidated financial statements relating to Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities to a related party). We have no long term liabilities at January 31, 2023 and long term liabilities amounted
to $17,935 at April 30, 2023. Our total liabilities as at January 31, 2023 is the same as our current liabilities as at January 31, 2023.
Our total liabilities as at April, 2022 was $902,850.

Consolidated Results of Operations
Comparative Results for the Nine Months Ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022
The Company had revenue from
sales for the nine months period ended January 31, 2023 of $4,414. The loss per share, both basic and diluted, was $0.005. This was anticipated
by the Company since the efforts of the Company have been focused on research and development and maintaining operations.
For the nine months period
ended January 31, 2023 we had a revenue of $4,414 which is an increase in revenue from the same period ended January 31, 2022 of $nil.
We believe this trend will continue for the near future. Management believes it is important to participate in the studies that are currently
ongoing.
Our total general administrative
expenses and research and development expenses have decreased from $488,718 for the nine months period in 2023 over the same periods of
$597,143 in 2022. The reduction in costs is largely due to savings in legal and other overhead expenses.
Comparative Results for the Three Months Ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022
The Company had no revenue
from sales for the third quarter ended January 31, 2023. The loss per share, both basic and diluted, was $0.002. This was anticipated
by the Company since the efforts of the Company have been focused on research and development and maintaining operations.
For the three month period
ended January 31, 2023 we had no revenue, which is the same as the same period ended January 31, 2022. We believe this trend will continue
for the near future. Management believes it is important to participate in the studies that are currently ongoing.
Our total general administrative
expenses and research and development expenses have decreased to $155,388 for the three month period in 2023 from the same periods of
$236,414 in 2022. The reduction in costs is largely due to savings in legal and other overhead expenses.

Management believes that it will be necessary
to sell additional shares to have the funds necessary to continue to pay the legal and accounting fees as the Company continues the process
to have its shares trading in a public market. In addition, we may use additional shares to attract contractors in the manufacturing and
shipping sectors as we bring our product to the market in Europe.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash flows used in operating
activities for the nine month period ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 reflects an increase of $93,129 net cash
used in operating activities. Our net cash provided by financing activities reflect an increase of $12,724 for the nine month period ended
January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Cash and restricted cash held in trust at the beginning of the period in 2023 was
$437,177 compared to $699,777 Cash and restricted cash held in trust at the beginning of the same period in 2022. Cash and restricted
cash held in trust at the end of the period in 2023 was $54,627 compared to $379,606 Cash and restricted cash held in trust at the end
of the same period in 2022.
Management believes that
the burn rate of our cash will decrease as our legal and accounting fees diminish and become more stable. We believe that it will be necessary
to raise additional cash to commence manufacturing and distribution of our product when we have had our partners complete their studies.
The table below provides the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
This management’s discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial
instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. During the nine month period ended January 31, 2023, we have made no material changes or additions with
regard to such estimates and judgments.
19
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of January 31, 2023, we
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or
contractual obligations.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the JOBS
Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying
public companies. We will qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new
or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay
the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the
relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our financial statements may
not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
Additionally, we are in the
process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain
conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not
be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public
companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by
the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about
the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items
such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee
compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until
we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.
20
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.
We have not engaged in any
hedging activities since our inception and we do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which
we are exposed.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition
of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e). The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the Company’s desired disclosure control objectives. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Therefore, even a system which is determined
to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems of internal controls
are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
At the end of the period
being reported upon, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective  to ensure that the material information required to be included
in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
and financial officer, as well as recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms relating to the Company.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in
the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the nine month period ended January 31, 2023 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
