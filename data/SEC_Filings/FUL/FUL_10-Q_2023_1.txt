In our opinion, the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Operating results for interim periods are
not
necessarily indicative of results that
may
be expected for the fiscal year as a whole.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form

as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In
September 2022,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU  No.
2022 - 04,
Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic
405 - 50 ): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.
This ASU requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of the financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. To achieve that objective, the buyer should disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its supplier finance programs.  Our effective date of this ASU is our fiscal year ending
December 1, 2024.
We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently issued accounting standards or pronouncements
not
disclosed above have been excluded as they are

Long-Term Debt
On
February 15, 2023,
we entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions (“Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) which replaces our existing revolving credit agreement under the amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated
October 20, 2020
and also replaces our secured term loan credit agreement dated
October 20, 2017.
The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a new senior secured term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 500,000
(“Term Loan A”), a new senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 800,000
(“Term Loan B”) and amendments to and extension of our existing senior secured revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment in the amount of $ 700,000
(“Revolving Credit Facility”). A portion of the proceeds of the combined facilities, (the “Credit Facilities”) was used to pay off the existing term loan and revolver. The Credit Facilities will generally be used to finance working capital needs and acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes. All of our obligations under the Credit Facilities will be secured by a
first -lien security interest in substantially all personal property and material real property of the Company and its material U.S. subsidiaries, and will be guaranteed by all of the Company’s material U.S. subsidiaries.
Term Loans
Interest on Term Loan A is payable at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus an adjustment of  0.10
percent and an interest rate spread of
1.75
percent ( 6.47  percent at
March 4, 2023).
The interest rate spread is based on a secured leverage grid. Term Loan A matures on
February 15, 2028.
Interest on Term Loan B is payable at SOFR plus an interest rate spread of
2.50
percent with a SOFR floor of
0.50
percent ( 7.12  percent at
March 4, 2023).
Term Loan B matures on
February 15, 2030.
On
January 12, 2023,
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert $ 400,000
of our variable rate
1 -month LIBOR rate debt to a fixed rate of
3.6895
percent. On
February 28, 2023,
after entering into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we amended the interest rate swap agreement to
1 -month SOFR and a fixed rate of
3.7260
in accordance with the practical expedients included in ASC
848,
Reference Rate Reform . See Note
12
for further discussion of this interest rate swap.
Revolving Credit Facility
Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is payable at SOFR plus an adjustment of
0.10
percent and an interest rate spread of
1.75
percent ( 6.47  percent at
March 4, 2023).
A facility fee of
25
basis points of the unused commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility is payable quarterly. The interest rate spread and the facility fee are based on a secured leverage grid. At
March 4, 2023,
there was
no
balance outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on
February 15, 2028.
The Revolving Credit Facility can be drawn upon for general corporate purposes up to a maximum of $ 700,000 , less issued letters of credit. At
March 4, 2023,
letters of credit reduced the available amount under the Revolving Credit Facil ity by $ 9,864 .
Covenants and Other
Under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A are subject to certain covenants and restrictions. For these facilities, we are required to maintain a secured leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement,
no
greater than
4.75
to
1.00
for our fiscal quarters ending on or prior to
June 1, 2024
and then
4.50
to
1.00
thereafter. We are also required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of
not
less than
2.00
to
1.00.
Restrictive covenants include, but are
not
limited to, limitations on secured and unsecured borrowings, interest coverage, intercompany transfers and investments,
third
party investments, dispositions of assets, leases, liens, dividends and distributions, and contains a maximum total debt to trailing
twelve
months EBITDA requirement. Certain covenants become less restrictive after meeting leverage or other financial ratios. In addition, we cannot be a member of any consolidated group as defined for income tax purposes other than with our subsidiaries.  The terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement do
not
require the financial covenants to be measured until the fiscal quarter ending
June 3, 2023.
We are subject to mandatory prepayments in the
first
quarter of each fiscal year equal to
50 % of Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, of the prior fiscal year less any voluntary prepayments made during that fiscal year. The Excess Cash Flow Percentage shall be reduced to
25
percent when our Secured Leverage Ratio is below
4.25:1.00
and to
0
percent when our Secured Leverage Ratio is below
3.75:1.00.

Earnings Per Share
A reconciliation of the common share components for the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations is as follows:

Weighted-average common and common equivalent shares diluted

Table of Contents
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to H.B. Fuller by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the applicable period. The difference between basic and diluted earnings per share is attributable to share-based compensation awards. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding shares, which computes total employee proceeds as the sum of (a) the amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award and (b) the amount of unearned share-based compensation costs attributed to future services. Share-based compensation awards for which total employee proceeds exceed the average market price over the applicable period have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share, and accordingly, are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
Share-based compensation awards of  1,172,987
and
700,250  shares for the
three
months ended
March 4, 2023
and
February 26, 2022 , respectively, were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations because they were antidilutive.

Financial Instruments
Overview
As a result of being a global enterprise, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates
may
affect the Company's net investment in foreign subsidiaries, and our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.
We use foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps and net investment hedges to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do
not
hold derivative financial instruments of a speculative nature or for trading purposes. We record derivatives as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivative qualifies and is designated as a hedge. Cash flows from derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. If a derivative is
no
longer expected to be effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in earnings.
We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance of counterparties for foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. We select investment-grade multinational banks and financial institutions as counterparties for derivative transactions and monitor the credit quality of each of these banks on a periodic basis as warranted. We do
not
anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties, and valuation allowances, if any, are de minimis.
Cash Flow Hedges
On
January 12, 2023,
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert $ 400,000
of our variable rate
1 -month LIBOR rate debt to a fixed rate of
3.6895
percent. On
February 28, 2023,
after refinancing our debt, we amended the interest rate
swap agreement to our
1 -month SOFR rate debt to a fixed rate of
3.7260
in accordance with the practical expedients included in ASC
848,
Reference Rate Reform . The combined fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $ 6,688  at
March 4, 2023
and was included in other assets i n the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The swaps were designated for hedge accounting treatment as cash flow hedges. We are applying the hypothetical derivative method to assess hedge effectiveness for these interest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of a hypothetically perfect swap with terms that match the critical terms of our variable rate debt are compared with the change in the fair value of the swaps.
The amounts of pretax gains (losses) recognized in Comprehensive Income related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are as follows:

Fair Value Hedges
On

Net Investment Hedges
On
October 17, 2022,
we entered into a float-to-float cross-currency interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of
€307,173
maturing in
October 2028.
On
October 20, 2022,
we entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of
€300,000
with tranches maturing in
August 2025,
August 2026
and
February 2027.
As of
March 4, 2023,
the combined fair value of the swaps was a liability
of $ 54,442
a nd was included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge a portion of the Company’s investment in Euro denominated foreign subsidiaries.
The swaps are designated as net investment hedges for accounting treatment. The net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within other comprehensive income (loss). The gains or losses are reclassified into earnings upon a liquidation event or deconsolidation of the foreign subsidiary. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the period of change. The amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to net investment hedge cross-currency swaps was a loss
of $ 41,042   as of
March 4, 2023.
The amounts of pretax loss recognized in comprehensive income related to the net investment he dge was $ 397   for the
three
months ended
March 4, 2023.
As of
March 4, 2023,
we did
not
reclassify any gains or losses into earnings from net investment hedges and we do
not
expect to reclassify any such gain or loss into earnings within the next
twelve
months.
No
amounts related to net investment hedges have been excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Derivatives
Not
Designated As Hedging Instruments
We use foreign currency forward contracts to offset our exposure to the change in value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held at foreign subsidiaries that are remeasured at the end of each period. Although the contracts are effective economic hedges, they are
not
designated as accounting hedges. Foreign currency forward contracts are recorded as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
As of
March 4, 2023 , we had forward foreign currency contracts maturing
between
March 6, 2023  and
November 21, 2023.
The ma rk-to-market effect associated with these contracts was largely offset by the underlying transaction gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency exposures for which these contracts relate.
The amounts of pretax gains (losses) recognized in other income, net related to derivative instruments
not
designated as hedging instruments for the  three
months ended
March 4, 2023
and
February 26, 2022
were  $ 7,154
a nd $ 4,237 , respectively.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of entities in the customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and countries. As of
March 4, 2023 , there were
no
significant concentrations of credit risk.

Fair Value Measurements
Overview
Estimates of fair value for financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the accounting guidance for fair value measurements. The framework defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. The framework discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The framework utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
three
broad levels. The following is a brief description of those
three
levels:
●
Level
1:
Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level
2:
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not
active.
●
Level
3:
Unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
Balances Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following table presents information about our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
March 4, 2023
and
December 3, 2022 , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value.

Balances Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include intangible assets acquired in an acquisition. The identified intangible assets of customer relationships, technology and tradenames acquired in connection with our acquisitions were measured using unobservable (Level  3 ) inputs. The fair value of the intangible assets was calculated using either the income or cost approach. Significant inputs include estimated revenue growth rates, gross margins, operating expenses, attrition rate, royalty rate and discount rate.
See Note  2  for further discussion regarding our acquisitions.
Balances Disclosed at Fair Value
Long-term debt had an estimated fair value of $ 1,714,383  and $ 1,713,257
as of
March 4, 2023
and
December 3, 2022 , respectively. The fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered for debt of similar maturities. The estimated fair value of these long-term obligations is
not
necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realized in a current market exchange.

Commitments and Contingencies
Environmental Matters
We are involved in environmental investigations, clean-up activities and administrative proceedings related to environmental compliance matters at former and current operating facilities.   We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and/or similar state laws that impose liability for costs relating to the clean-up of contamination resulting from past spills, disposal or other release of hazardous substances associated with landfills and/or hazardous waste sites. As a PRP, we
may
be required to pay a share of the costs of investigation and clean-up of these sites. We are subject to similar laws in some of the countries where current and former facilities are located. Our environmental, health and safety department monitors compliance with applicable laws on a global basis. To the extent we can reasonably estimate the amount of our probable liabilities for environmental matters, we establish an undiscounted financial provision. We recorded liabilities of $ 5,541
and $ 5,754  as of
March 4, 2023
and
December 3, 2022 , respectively, for probable and reasonably estimable environmental remediation costs. Of the amount reserved, $ 2,640
and $ 2,789  as of
March 4, 2023
and
December 3, 2022 , respectively, is attributable to a facility we own in Simpsonville, South Carolina as a result of our Royal Adhesives acquisition that is a designated site under CERCLA.
While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we have concluded that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will
not
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.
Other Legal Proceedings
From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to, or a target of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, contract, patent and intellectual property, environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. While we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters, we have concluded, based upon currently available information, that the ultimate resolution of any pending matter, individually or in the aggregate, including the asbestos litigation described in the following paragraphs, will
not
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.
We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits in which plaintiffs have alleged injury due to products containing asbestos manufactured more than
35
years ago. The plaintiffs generally bring these lawsuits against multiple defendants and seek damages (both actual and punitive) in very large amounts. In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable injuries or that the injuries suffered were the result of exposure to products manufactured by us. We are typically dismissed as a defendant in such cases without payment. If the plaintiff presents evidence indicating that compensable injury occurred as a result of exposure to our products, the case is generally settled for an amount that reflects the seriousness of the injury, the length, intensity and character of exposure to products containing asbestos, the number and solvency of other defendants in the case, and the jurisdiction in which the case has been brought.
16
Table of Contents
A significant portion of the defense costs and settlements in asbestos-related litigation is paid by
third
parties, including indemnification pursuant to the provisions of a
1976
agreement under which we acquired a business from a
third
party. Currently, this
third
party is defending and paying settlement amounts, under a reservation of rights, in most of the asbestos cases tendered to the
third
party.
In addition to the indemnification arrangements with
third
parties, we have insurance policies that generally provide coverage for asbestos liabilities, including defense costs. Historically, insurers have paid a significant portion of our defense costs and settlements in asbestos-related litigation. However, certain of our insurers are insolvent. We have entered into cost-sharing agreements with our insurers that provide for the allocation of defense costs and settlements and judgments in asbestos-related lawsuits. These agreements require, among other things, that we fund a share of settlements and judgments allocable to years in which the responsible insurer is insolvent.
A summary of the number of and settlement amounts for asbestos-related lawsuits and claims is as follows:

We do
not
believe that it would be meaningful to disclose the aggregate number of asbestos-related lawsuits filed against us because relatively few of these lawsuits are known to involve exposure to asbestos-containing products that we manufactured. Rather, we believe it is more meaningful to disclose the number of lawsuits that are settled and result in a payment to the plaintiff. To the extent we can reasonably estimate the amount of our probable liabilities for pending asbestos-related claims, we establish a financial provision and a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries.
Based on currently available information, we have concluded that the resolution of any pending matter, including asbestos-related litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will
not
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.

Segments
We are required to report segment information in the same way that we internally organize our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. Revenue and operating income of each of our segments are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. Segment operating income is identified as gross profit less SG&A expenses. Corporate expenses, other than those included in Corporate Unallocated, are allocated to each operating segment. Consistent with our internal management reporting, Corporate Unallocated amounts include business acquisition and integration costs, organizational restructuring charges and project costs associated with our implementation of Project ONE. Corporate assets are
not
allocated to the operating segments. Inter-segment revenues are recorded at cost plus a markup for administrative costs.
We have  three
reportable segments: Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives. The business components within each operating segment are managed to maximize the results of the overall operating segment rather than the results of any individual business component of the operating segment. Results of individual components of each operating segment are subject to numerous allocations of segment-wide costs that
may
or
may
not
have been focused on that particular component for a particular reporting period. The costs for these allocated resources are
not
tracked on a "where-used" basis as financial performance is assessed at the total operating segment level.
The table below provides certain information regarding net revenue and operating income (loss) for each of our operating segments.

Subsequent Event
On
March 27, 2023,
the Company approved a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) related to organizational changes and other actions to optimize operations. In implementing the Plan, we currently expect to incur costs of approximately $ 15,000
to $ 20,000  ($ 12,400
to $ 16,400
after-tax), which includes (i) cash expenditures of approximately $ 13,800
to $ 15,000
($ 11,100  to $ 12,100  after tax) for severance and related employee costs globally and (ii) other restructuring costs related to streamlining of processes and the payment of anticipated income taxes in certain jurisdictions related to the Plan. The Plan will be implemented beginning in the
second
quarter of fiscal year
2023
and is currently expected to be completed during fiscal year
2025.
The restructuring costs will be spread across the next several fiscal quarters as the measures are implemented with the majority of the charges recognized and cash payments occurring in fiscal
2023
and
2024.
Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
The Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the MD&A included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 3, 2022 for important background information related to our business.
Net revenue in the first quarter of 2023 decreased 5.5 percent from the first quarter of 2022. Net revenue decreased 10.8 percent due to sales volume and 4.9 percent due to negative currency effects, offset by an 8.3 percent increase due to price and a 1.9 percent  increase due to acquisitions
compared to the first quarter of 2022. The negative currency effects were primarily driven by
a weaker Euro, Egyptian pound, Chinese renminbi, Argentinian peso and Turkish lira  compared to the U.S. dollar . Gross profit margin increased
160  basis points due to an increase in product pricing.
Net income attributable to H.B. Fuller in the first quarter of 2023 was $21.9 million compared to $38.3 million in the first quarter of 2022. On a diluted earnings per share basis, the first quarter of 2023 was $0.39 per share compared to $0.69 per share for the first quarter of 2022.
Restructuring Plan
On March 27, 2023, the Company approved a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) related to organizational changes and other actions to optimize operations. In implementing the Plan, the Company currently expects to incur costs of approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million ($12.4 million to $16.4 million after-tax), which includes (i) cash expenditures of approximately $13.8 million to $15.0 million ($11.1 million to $12.1 million after tax) for severance and related employee costs globally and (ii) other restructuring costs related to streamlining of processes and the payment of anticipated income taxes in certain jurisdictions related to the Plan. The Plan will be implemented beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and is currently expected to be completed during fiscal year 2025. The restructuring costs will be spread across the next several fiscal quarters as the measures are implemented with the majority of the charges recognized and cash payments occurring in fiscal 2023 and 2024.

The decrease is driven
by a decrease in volume partially offset by an increase in product pricing.
The 1.9 percent increase from M&A is due to acquisitions. The negative 4.9 percent foreign currency impact was primarily driven by a

Income tax expense of $9.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 includes $0.8 million of discrete tax expense. Excluding the discrete tax expense, the overall effective tax rate was 29.2 percent. The discrete tax expense relates to various foreign tax matters offset by an excess tax benefit related to U.S. stock compensation. Income tax expense of $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 includes $2.9 million of discrete tax benefit. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the overall effective tax rate was 27.8 percent. The discrete tax benefit relates to impacts of legal entity mergers offset by foreign tax matters.

The income from equity method investments relates to our 50 percent ownership of the Sekisui-Fuller joint venture in Japan. The lower income for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 is due to the unfavorable impact of the weakening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar and lower net income in our joint venture.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Total cash and cash equivalents as of March 4, 2023 were $125.5 million compared to $79.9 million as of December 3, 2022 and $63.5 million as of February 26, 2022. The majority of the $125.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 4, 2023 was held outside the United States. Total long and short-term debt was $1,873.5 million as of March 4, 2023, $1,765.1 million as of December 3, 2022 and $1,914.1 million as of February 26, 2022. The total debt to total capital ratio as measured by Total Debt divided by (Total Debt plus Total Stockholders’ Equity) was 53.4 percent as of March 4, 2023 as compared to 52.3 percent as of December 3, 2022 and 53.8 percent as of February 26, 2022.
We believe that cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet our ongoing liquidity and capital expenditure needs. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. Cash available in the United States has historically been sufficient and we expect it will continue to be sufficient to fund U.S. operations, U.S. capital spending and U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit contributions in addition to funding U.S. acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service and share repurchases as needed. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, we currently have no intention to, and plans do not indicate a need to, repatriate these funds for U.S. operations.
Our credit agreements include restrictive covenants beginning for the quarter ending June 3, 2023 that, if not met, could lead to a renegotiation of our credit lines and a significant increase in our cost of financing. Those covenants are as follows:

*
The terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement do not require the financial covenants to be measured until the fiscal quarter ending June 3, 2023
EBITDA for covenant purposes is defined as consolidated net income, plus (i) interest expense, (ii) expense for taxes paid or accrued, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) certain non-cash impairment losses, (v) extraordinary non-cash losses incurred other than in the ordinary course of business, (vi) nonrecurring extraordinary non-cash restructuring charges and the non-cash impact of purchase accounting, (vii) any non-cash charge for the excess of rent expense over actual cash rent paid due to the use of straight-line rent, non-cash charge pursuant to any management equity plan, stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit, (viii) any non-cash finance charges in respect of any pension liabilities or other provisions and income (loss) attributable to deferred compensation plans, (ix) any non-recurring or unusual cash restructuring charges and operating improvements, (x) cost savings initiative and cost synergies related to acquisitions within 12 months, (xi) non-capitalized charges relating to the Borrower’s SAP implementation, (xii) fees, costs, expenses and charges incurred in connection with the financing, (xiii) fees, costs, expenses, make-whole or penalty payments and other similar items arising out of acquisitions, investments and dispositions, the incurrence, issuance, repayment or refinancing of indebtedness and any issuance of equity interests; minus, non-recurring or unusual non-cash gains incurred not in the ordinary course of business. Provided that the aggregate amounts that may be added back for any period pursuant to clauses (ix), (x) and (xi) shall not exceed 15% of EBITDA for such period (calculated prior to giving effect to all addbacks and adjustments). For Secured Total Indebtedness / TTM EBITDA ratio, TTM EBITDA is adjusted for the pro forma results from Material Acquisitions and Material Divestitures as if the acquisition or divestiture occurred at the beginning of the calculation period. The full definition is set forth in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and can be found in the Company’s 8-K filing dated February 21, 2023.
Consolidated Interest Expense for covenant purposes is defined as the interest expense (including without limitation to the portion of capital lease obligations that constitutes imputed interest in accordance with GAAP) of the Borrower and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis for such period with respect to all outstanding indebtedness allocable to such period in accordance with GAAP, including net costs (or benefits) under Interest Rate Swap Agreements and commissions, discounts and other fees and charges with respect to letters of credit and the interest component of all Attributable Receivables Indebtedness.
We believe we have the ability to meet all of our contractual obligations and commitments in fiscal 2023.

Free cash flow after dividends, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operations less purchased property, plant and equipment and dividends paid. Free cash flow after dividends is an integral financial measure used by the Company to assess its ability to generate cash in excess of its operating needs, therefore, the Company believes this financial measure provides useful information to investors. The following table reflects the manner in which free cash flow after dividends is determined and provides a reconciliation of free cash flow after dividends to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Trade receivables, net – Trade receivables, net was a source of cash of $55.4 million and $13.3 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The higher source of cash in 2023 compared to 2022 was due to more cash collected on trade receivables in the current year compared to the prior year. The DSO were 64 days at March 4, 2023 and 65 days at February 26, 2022.

●
Inventory – Inventory was a use of cash of $33.8 million and $87.4 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower use of cash in 2023 is due to lower inventory purchases in 2023 compared to 2022. Inventory days on hand were 84 days as of March 4, 2023 and 82 days as of February 26, 2022.
●
Trade payables – Trade payables was a source of cash of $9.0 million and $46.5 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower source of cash in 2023 compared to 2022 reflects higher payments on trade payables in the current year compared to the prior year.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by the use of words like "plan," "expect," "aim," "believe," "project," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "will," "should," "could" (including the negative or variations thereof) and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, our plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described in this report, Item 1A. Risk Factors identifies some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we have identified these important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors should be considered, together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language that may be made elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The list of important factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors does not necessarily present the risk factors in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors, and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by us in this report and elsewhere from time to time, represents our best judgment as of the date the information is given. We do not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the SEC or in our press releases) on related subjects.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  See Part II, Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 3, 2022 for further discussion of these market risks. There have been no material changes in the reported market risk of the Company since December 3, 2022.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president and chief executive officer and executive vice president, chief financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of March 4, 2023. Based on this evaluation, our president and chief executive officer and executive vice president, chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 4, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Table of Contents
For purposes of Rule 13a-15(e), the term
disclosure controls and procedures
means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its president and chief executive officer and executive vice president, chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Environmental Matters
We are involved in environmental investigations, clean-up activities and administrative proceedings related to environmental compliance matters at former and current operating facilities.   We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and/or similar state laws that impose liability for costs relating to the clean up of contamination resulting from past spills, disposal or other release of hazardous substances associated with landfills and/or hazardous waste sites. As a PRP, we may be required to pay a share of the costs of investigation and clean-up of these sites. We are subject to similar laws in some of the countries where current and former facilities are located. Our environmental, health and safety department monitors compliance with applicable laws on a global basis.
To the extent we can reasonably estimate the amount of our probable liabilities for environmental matters, we establish a financial provision.
While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we have concluded that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.
Other Legal Proceedings
From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to, or a target of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, contract, patent and intellectual property, environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. While we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters, we have concluded, based upon currently available information, that the ultimate resolution of any pending matter, individually or in the aggregate, including asbestos-related litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. However, adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact the results of operations or cash flows in one or more future periods.
For additional information regarding environmental matters and other legal proceedings, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The total number of shares purchased are shares withheld to satisfy the employees’ withholding taxes upon vesting of restricted stock.
Repurchases of common stock are made to support our stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. Upon vesting of restricted stock awarded to employees, shares are withheld to cover the employees’ minimum withholding taxes.
On April 7, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding common shares for a period of up to five years. Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares for cash on the open market, from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions or block transactions, or through an accelerated repurchase agreement. The timing of such repurchases is dependent on price, market conditions and applicable regulatory requirements. Upon repurchase of the shares, we reduce our common stock for the par value of the shares with the excess being applied against additional paid-in capital. This authorization replaces the April 6, 2017 authorization to repurchase shares.
