BION ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
1.         ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF BUSINESS, GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S PLANS :
Organization and nature of business:
Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc.'s ("Bion,"
"Company," "We," "Us," or "Our") was incorporated in 1987 in the State of Colorado. Bion’s
mission is to create extraordinary value for our shareholders and employees (all of whom own securities in the Company) while delivering
premium, sustainable products to our customers through ventures developing profitable, transparent, and sustainable solutions for livestock
agriculture.
Our patented and proprietary technology provides advanced
waste treatment and resource recovery for large-scale livestock production facilities (also known as “Concentrated Animal Feeding
Operations” or “CAFOs"). Livestock production and its waste, particularly from CAFOs, has been identified as one of the
greatest soil, air, and water quality problems in the U.S. today.  Application of our third-generation technology and business/technology
platform (“Gen3Tech”) can largely mitigate these environmental problems, while simultaneously improving operational/ resource
efficiencies by recovering high-value co-products from the CAFOs’ waste stream. These waste stream ‘assets’ –
nutrients and methane – have traditionally been wasted or underutilized and are the same ‘pollutants’ that today fuel
harmful algae blooms, contaminate surface groundwater, and exacerbate climate change.
Bion’s business model and technology platform
can create the opportunity for joint ventures
(in various contractual forms) (“JVs”) between the Company and large livestock/food/fertilizer
industry participants based upon the supplemental cash flow generated by implementation of our Gen3Tech business model, which cash flows
will support the costs of technology implementation (including servicing related debt). We anticipate this will result in substantial
long-term value for Bion. In the context of such JVs, we believe that the verifiable sustainable branding opportunities (conventional
and organic) in meat will represent the single largest enhanced revenue contributor provided by Bion to the JVs (and Bion licensees).
The Company believes that the largest portion of its business with be conducted through such JVs, but a material portion may involve licensing
and or other approaches.
Bion’s Gen3Tech was designed to capture and
stabilize these assets and produce renewable energy, fertilizer products, and clean water as part of the process of raising verifiably
sustainable livestock. All steps and stages in the treatment process will be third-party verified, providing the basis for additional
revenues, including renewable energy-related credits and, eventually, payment for ecosystem services, such as nutrient credits as described
below. The same verified data will be used to substantiate the claims of a USDA-certified sustainable brand that will support premium
pricing for the meat/ animal protein products that are produced in Bion facilities.
During the first half of 2022 Bion began
marketing our sustainable beef to retailers, food service distributors and the meat industry in the U.S.  In general, the response
has been favorable. During July 2022, Bion announced a letter of intent (“Ribbonwire LOI”) to develop a large-scale commercial
project - a 15,000-head sustainable beef cattle feeding operation together with the Ribbonwire Ranch, in Dalhart, Texas (with a provision
to expand to 60,000 head) (“Dalhart Project”). During January 2023 Bion announced a letter of intent (“Olson LOI”)
to develop a large-scale commercial project - a 15,000-head sustainable beef cattle feeding operation together with the Olson Feeders
and TD Angus, near North Platte, Nebraska (with a provision to expand to 45,000 head or more) (“Olson Project”). The Olson
Project and the Dalhart Project (and subsequent Projects) will be developed to produce blockchain-verified, sustainable beef in customized
covered barns (with reduced stress on cattle caused by extreme weather and temperatures and resulting higher feed/weight gain efficiency)
with ongoing manure transfer to anaerobic digesters (AD) to both capture nitrogen from the manure stream before loss to the atmosphere
and generating renewable natural gas (RNG) for sale while remediating the environmental impacts associated usually associated with cattle
CAFOs. Bion’s patented technology will refine the waste stream into valuable coproducts that include clean water, RNG, photovoltaic
solar electricity and organic fertilizer products. We anticipate converting the Ribbonwire LOI and Olson LOI into a definitive joint
venture agreements and creating distribution agreements with key retailers and food service distributors during the next six-nine months.
8
Our business plan is focused on executing
multiple agreements and letters of intent related to additional sustainable beef joint venture projects over the next twelve months while
moving forward with the Initial Project (see below) and the Dalhart and Olson Projects (and/or other Gen3Tech beef JV projects) and pursuing
other opportunities in the livestock industry enabled by our Gen3Tech business model.  The Ribbonwire and Olson LOI announcements
have generated significant interest within the livestock industry (among ranchers, feedlot operators, farmers and other AG industry parties).
We believe that this interest, combined with consumer interest in ‘sustainable products’ and growing enthusiasm among some
livestock industry parties for environmental/sustainable/regenerative practices, may provide Bion (and its partners/venturers) with an
opportunity to move forward with a truly sustainable solution in this industry segment at a rapid pace.
During the next three months, the Company
intends to complete construction and begin operations of phase 1 of our Initial Project located near Fair Oaks, Indiana. Bion
expects the Initial Project to provide data that illustrates the effectiveness of our Gen3Tech in a commercial setting by the end of
the 2 nd
quarter in 2023 and supports development of the Dalhart and Olson Projects (and/or other Gen3Tech beef JV
projects) commencing later during 2023.  We believe this data will also provide additional potential stakeholders (cattle
producers, cattle feeders, packers, food distributors and retailers and financial institutions) with the information they need to
proceed with confidence in collaborating with Bion on multiple new projects (see below).
Bion is now focused primarily on: i) development/construction/operation
of the Initial Project, our initial commercial-scale Gen3Tech installation, ii) pre-development planning of the Dalhart and Olson Projects
(and/or other Gen3Tech beef JV projects), iii) developing applications and markets for its low carbon organic fertilizer products and
its sustainable (conventional and organic) animal protein products, and iv) discussions regarding initiation and development of agreements
and joint ventures (“JVs” as discussed below) (and related projects) based on the augmented capabilities of our Gen3Tech
business platform (in the sustainable beef and other livestock segments), while (v) continuing to pursue business opportunities related
to large retrofit projects (such as the Kreider poultry project JV described below) and vi) ongoing R&D activities.
HISTORY, BACKGROUND AND CURRENT ACTIVITIES
Since the Company’s inception, Bion has designed and developed
advanced waste treatment systems for livestock. The first and second generations of Bion’s technology platform were biological systems,
primarily focused on nutrient control. Over 30 of these systems were deployed at New York dairies, Florida food processing facilities
and dairies, North Carolina hog farms, a Texas dairy and a Pennsylvania dairy (“Kreider 1 Project”). The systems were highly
effective at their intended purpose: capturing nitrogen and phosphorus. They produced BionSoil as a byproduct, which was a remarkably
effective soil amendment/ fertilizer product, but whose value was not enough to support a viable business model. As such, these early
technology iterations were largely dependent on either implementation of new regulations requiring waste treatment, or subsidy/ incentive
programs that would provide ‘payment for ecosystem services’. By the mid-2010’s, it became apparent that neither of
these options were imminent or even assured, so the Company initiated the steps to reimagine and redesign its technology.
From 2016 to 2021 fiscal years, the Company focused
most of its activities and resources on developing, testing and demonstrating the third generation of its technology and technology platform
(“Gen3Tech”) that was developed with an emphasis producing more valuable co-products from the waste treatment process, including
renewable natural gas and ammonium bicarbonate, a low-carbon, organic ’pure’ nitrogen fertilizer product while raising livestock
in a verifiably sustainable manner to generate premium sustainable meat products.
The $175 billion U.S. livestock industry is under
intense scrutiny for its environmental and public health impacts – its ‘environmental sustainability’-- at the same
time it is struggling with declining revenues and margins (derived in part from clinging to its historic practices and resulting limitations
and impacts) which threaten its ‘economic sustainability’. Its failure to adequately respond to consumer concerns including
food safety, environmental impacts, and inhumane treatment of animals have provided impetus for plant-based alternatives such as Beyond
Meat and Impossible Burger (and many others) being marketed as “sustainable” alternatives for this growing consumer segment
of the market.
9
The Company believes that its Gen3Tech, in addition
to providing superior environmental remediation, creates opportunities for large scale production of i) verifiably sustainable, branded
livestock products and ii) verifiably sustainable organic-branded livestock products, both of which will command premium pricing (in part
due to ongoing monitoring and third-party verification of environmental performance which will provide meaningful assurances to both consumers
and regulatory agencies). Each of these two distinct market segments (which the Company intends to pursue in parallel) presents a large
production/marketing opportunity for Bion. Our Gen3Tech will also produce (as co-products) biogas, solar photovoltaic electricity in appropriate
locations, and valuable low carbon organic fertilizer products, which can be utilized in the production of organic grains for use as feed
for raising organic livestock (some of which may be utilized in the Company’s JV projects) and/or marketed to the growing organic
fertilizer market.
During July 2022 and January 2023, the Company entered
into letters of intent with Ribbonwire Ranch (Dalhart, Texas) and Olson Feeders, North Platte, Nebraska, respectively, setting forth the
parties’ intentions to negotiate joint venture agreements and enter into JVs to develop and operate initial
15,000
head integrated,
sustainable beef facility for each Project including:
a) innovative cattle barns (with slatted floors to facilitate movement of manure to the anaerobic digester
and potentially solar PV generation on the rooftops which barns will improve the living conditions of the animals while increasing feeding/weight
gain efficiency,
b) ‘customized’ anaerobic digestion systems (including pretreatment to increase renewable natural
gas (‘RNG’) production and an RNG cleaning system (which will include capture/recycling of the CO2) to allow pipeline sales
and monetization of related environmental credits,
c) a Bion Gen3Tech module (which will utilize the recycled CO2 to
increase ammonium bicarbonate recovery) for the production of ammonium bicarbonate fertilizer for use in organic crop production
(plus residual organic solids and clean water), and
d) which will produce verifiably sustainable beef products with USDA certified branding.
The Dalhart Project and the Olson Project, respectively, will
include expansion capability up to 60,000 and 45,000 (or more) head of cattle, in aggregate, located at/around/contiguous to the initial
Project facilities.
The opportunity presented by the Ribbonwire LOI and Olson LOI to commercialize
the Company’s Gen3Tech and business model matured more quickly than anticipated (reflecting strong industry and public momentum
in favor of verifiably sustainable food ventures). As a result, we have shifted our plans to focus resources and make our initial 15,000
head modules a reality as soon as possible.
To place the Olson and Dalhart Projects in the context of Company’s
business plan (and our prior public disclosure), if the contemplated JV moves forward on the timelines set forth in the LOIs, active development
of the Dalhart Project and/or Olson Project will commence during the second half of 2023.
Prior to such activity, the Company intends to construct and operate the
initial phase of the previously announced Gen3Tech demonstration project near Fair Oaks, Indiana (“Initial Project”): i)
to validate our existing data and modeling at commercial scale and ii) to optimize the Bion Gen3Tech module for finalization of design
parameters and fabrication details of our planned 15,000 head commercial facilities (including the Dalhart and Olson Projects). For the
purposes of this initial phase, the Company, in order to accelerate the data acquisition phase, intends to utilize anaerobic digester
effluent from the nearby/contiguous Fair Oaks dairy. Construction and related activities of this demonstration project have commenced
with main module assembly on site targeted to commence during February 2023 (somewhat delayed due to supply chain constraints) followed
by operations through the first half of 2023 (and thereafter) to generate the required information. Thereafter, the Company will evaluate
what, if any, additional facilities and testing will take place at that location.
The Company anticipates that it will negotiate additional letters of intent
and enter into additional joint ventures related to the development of further commercial-scale sustainable beef projects over the next
6-18 months in addition to the Dalhart and Olson Projects.
10
As previously disclosed, during late September 2021,
Bion entered into a lease for the development site of the Initial Project, our initial commercial scale Gen3Tech project, which Initial
Project will be located on approximately four (4) acres of leased land near Fair Oaks, Indiana, and a related agreement regarding disposal
of certain manure effluent with the Curtis Creek Dairy unit of Fair Oaks Farms (“FOF”). Design and pre-development work commenced
during August 2021 and surveying, site engineering and other site-specific engineering and design work is largely completed. Fabrication
of the primary Gen3Tech equipment modules for the Initial Project commenced during January 2022. Construction work has been largely completed
to to prepare for the arrival in mid-February of the main modules of the Gen3Tech system. The Initial Project was initially planned to
be an environmentally sustainable beef cattle feeding facility, equipped with state-of-the-art housing and Bion’s 3G-Tech platform
to provide waste treatment and resource recovery. Bion designed the project to house and feed approximately
300
head of beef cattle.
If all phases of the Initial Project are constructed, the facility will include Bion’s Gen3Tech platform including: i) covered
barns (possibly including roof top solar photovoltaic generation), ii) anaerobic digestion for renewable energy recovery, iii) livestock
waste treatment and resource recovery technology, iv) Bion’s ammonium bicarbonate recovery and crystallization technology and iv)
data collection software to document system efficiencies and environmental benefits (with the Bion Gen3Tech facilities capable of treating
the waste from approximately
1,500
head). The facility will be large enough to demonstrate engineering capabilities of Bion’s Gen3Tech
at commercial scale, but small enough that it can be constructed and commissioned relatively quickly. Originally, construction and onsite
assembly operations were targeted to commence sometime late in 2022, however, supply chain backlogs have delayed likely delivery dates
for core modules of the Bion system to the site until sometime during February 2023. 3G1 has been moving forward with the development
process of the Initial Project. See Note 3 “Property and Equipment” and Note 10 “Subsequent Events” (for activities
since the start of the third quarter of the 2023 fiscal year).
The Initial Project is not being developed at economic
commercial scale or with an expectation of profitability due to its limited scale. However, successful installation, commissioning, and
operations will demonstrate scalability, determine operating parameters at scale, and provide ongoing production and engineering capabilities,
all being critical steps that must be accomplished before developing large projects with JV partners.
Specifically, the Initial Project is being developed
to provide and/or accomplish the following:
i.
Proof of Gen3Tech platform scalability
-
Document system efficiency and environmental benefits and enable final engineering modifications to optimize each unit process within the Bion Gen3technology platform.
-
Environmental benefits will include (without limitation) renewable energy production (natural gas recovery from AD and solar electric from integrated roof top photovoltaic generation); nutrient recovery and conversion to stable organic fertilizer; pathogen destruction; water recovery and reuse; air emission reductions.
ii.
Use Bion’s data collection system to support 3rd party verified system efficiency requirement to qualify for USDA Process-Verified-Program (PVP): certification of sustainable branded beef (and potentially pork) product metrics.
iii.
Produce sufficient ammonium bicarbonate nitrogen fertilizer (“AD Nitrogen”) for commercial testing by potential joint venture partners and/or purchasers and for university growth trials.
iv.
Produce sustainable beef products for initial test marketing efforts.
The Initial Project will be carried out in stages
with phase one focused on portions of items i. and iii. set forth above.
Upon completing the primary goals of phase 1 of
the Initial Project, (coupled with progress regarding organic certifications(s) for our solid ammonium bicarbonate
fertilizer product line), Bion expects to be ready to move forward with its plans for development (and related project financing) of
much larger facilities including the Dalhart and Olson Projects. The Company anticipates that discussions and negotiations it has
begun (together with additional opportunities that will be generated over the next 6-12 months) regarding potential JVs with
strategic partners in the financial, livestock and food distribution industries to develop large scale projects will continue during
the development/construction of the Initial Project with a 2023-24 goal of establishing multiple JV’s for large scale projects
that will produce sustainable and/or sustainable-organic corn-fed beef. These products will be supported by a USDA PVP-certified
sustainable brand that will, initially, highlight reductions in carbon and nutrient footprint, as well as pathogen reductions
associated with foodborne illness and antibiotic resistance, along with the organic designation where appropriate. Bion has
successfully navigated the USDA PVP application process previously, having received conditional approval of its 2G Tech platform
(pending resubmission and final site audits), and is confident it will be successful in qualifying its Gen3Tech platform.
11
After the basic technology start-up milestones of
the Initial Project (primarily optimization and steady-state operations of the core modules of our Gen3Tech platform) have been met, the
core modules may be re-located to a subsequent more permanent location to be determined at a later date. The Company is in discussion
with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to jointly develop an integrated beef facility based on Bion’s Gen3Tech and business model
at its Klosterman Feedyard Innovation Center (“KFIC”) including innovative barns, an anaerobic digester and a Bion Gen3Tech
system to conduct ongoing research and development related thereto and the KFIC is a possible site for the long term re-location of the
core modules. This venture, if it moves forward, is anticipated to include joint preparation of applications for grants and other funding
from the USDA (‘climate smart’ program, rural development, etc.) and other sources. The Company is also considering re-locating
the core modules of the Initial Project to Dalhart, Texas, where they may be integrated into the first phases of the Dalhart Project or
a separate smaller organic beef project.
The Company’s initial ammonium bicarbonate liquid
product completed its Organic Materials Review Institute (“OMRI”) application and review process with approval during May
2020. Applications for our first solid ammonium bicarbonate product line have been filed with OMRI, the California Department of Food
& Agriculture (“CDFA”) and the Iowa Organic Program (“IOP”) and are in the review processes (which is likely
to require an extended period of time and multiple procedural steps, in part due to the novel nature of our Gen3Tech in the context of
organic certifications). See ‘ Organic Fertilizer ’ below.
Additionally, the Company believes there will
also be opportunities to proceed with selected ‘retrofit projects’ of existing facilities (see ‘ Gen3Tech Kreider
2 Poultry Project’
below as an example) in the swine, dairy and poultry industries utilizing our Gen3Tech.
Bion believes that substantial unmet demand currently
exists– potentially very large – for ‘real’ meat/dairy/egg products that offer the verifiable/believable sustainability
consumers seek, but with the taste and texture they have come to expect from American beef and pork, dairy and poultry. Numerous studies
demonstrate the U.S. consumers’ preferences for sustainability. For example, 2019 NYU Stern’s Center for Sustainable Business
study found that ‘products marketed as sustainable grew 5.6 times faster than those that were not…’ and that ‘…in
more than 90 percent of consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) categories, sustainability-marketed products grew faster than their conventional
counterparts.’ Sales growth of plant-based alternatives, including both dairy and more recently ground meat (Beyond Meat, Impossible
Foods, etc.) have shown that a certain segment of consumersis
choosing seemingly sustainable offering, and are also willing to pay a
premium for it. Numerous studies also support the consumers’ ‘willingness-to-pay’ (WTP) for sustainable choices, including
a recent meta-analysis of 80 worldwide studies with results that calculate the overall WTP premium for sustainability is
29.5
percent
on average.
As one of the largest contributors to some of the
greatest air and water quality problems in America, it is clear that livestock waste cleanup, at scale, represents one of the greatest
opportunities we have to reduce negative environmental impacts of the food supply chain on air and water quality. Bion’s Gen3Tech
platform, along with its business model, enables the cleanup of the ‘dirtiest’ part of the food supply chain: animal protein
production and creates the opportunity to produce and market verifiably sustainable organic and conventional ‘real meat’ products
that can participate in the growth and premium pricing that appears to be readily available for the ‘right’ products.
Bion believes that at least a premium segment of the
U.S. beef industry (and potentially other livestock industry groups) is at the doorstep of a transformative opportunity to address the
growing demand for sustainable food product offerings, while pushing back against today’s anti-meat messaging. At $66 billion/year
(2021 wholesale/farmgate value), the beef industry is a fragmented, commodity industry whose practices date back decades. In 1935 inflation-adjusted
terms, beef is 63% more expensive today, while pork and chicken, which are now primarily raised in covered barns, at CAFOs with highly
integrated supply chains, are 12% and 62% cheaper, respectively. In recent years, the beef industry has come under increasing fire
from advocacy groups, regulatory agencies, institutional investors, and ultimately, their own consumers, over concerns that include climate
change, water pollution, food safety, and the treatment of animals and workers.
12
Advocacy groups targeting livestock and the beef industry
have recently been joined by competitors that produce animal protein alternatives in seeking to exploit the industry’s environmental
and economic weaknesses. Their global anti-meat messaging has had a substantial chilling effect on the relationships the beef industry
has with its institutional investors; retail distributors, such as fast-food restaurants; and mostly, its consumers. Led by the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, a coordinated anti-meat messaging campaign has targeted consumers worldwide, primarily focused
on the industry’s impacts on climate change. Meat alternatives, especially plant-based protein producers like Beyond Meat and Impossible
Foods, are being heavily promoted by themselves and the media, and have enjoyed steady sales growth. A 2018 NielsenIQ Homescan survey
last year found that 39% of Americans are actively trying to eat more plant-based foods. Some of the recent growth in plant-based proteins
results from increasing lactose intolerance and other health concerns; however, most of that growth is attributed to consumers’
growing concerns for the environmental impacts of real meat and dairy. Several large US companies that have traditionally focused on livestock
production, including Cargill, ADM, Perdue Foods, and Tyson, have recently entered the plant protein space. In terms of changing customer
preferences, ‘saving the planet’ has proven to be a more compelling argument than the traditional animal activism/ welfare
pitch. To date, the only ‘industry response’ to this has been grass-fed beef, which is regarded as a generally more sustainable
offering than grain-fed (largely without empirical evidence). However grass-fed beef has had only limited acceptance in U.S. markets,
because it is less flavorful and tougher than the traditional corn-fed beef consumers have grown to enjoy.
It should be noted that these plant-based protein
producers are primarily expected to be able to serve the ground/ processed meat market, which represents only about 10 percent of the
overall animal protein market. Further, there has recently been pushback to these plant-based products, focusing on their highly processed
nature and unproven health benefits, scalability/ pricing, and their uncertain carbon footprint. There have also been several companies
recently enter the cellular and 3D-printed meat arena. While facing myriad challenges and further out on the development timeline, some
people believe cellular agriculture (aka cultured, clean, lab-grown, cultivated) meat may have the potential to service a much larger
percentage of the market than plant-based protein, including cuts like steaks, chops and roasts, but the likely cost remains very uncertain
at this point.
Each of these items supports Bion’s belief that
there is a potentially very large opportunity to supply premium sustainable beef products that satisfy these concerns. We believe that
the real meat/beef products that can be cost-effectively produced today using our Gen3Tech platform, both sustainable and/or organic,
can provide an affordable product that satisfies the consumer’s desire for sustainability, but with the superior taste and texture
those consumers have grown to prefer.
Sustainable Beef
Bion’s goal is to be first to market with meaningfully
verified sustainable beef products that can be produced at sufficient scale to service national market demand. The cattle produced at
a Bion facility will have a substantially lower carbon footprint, dramatically reduced nutrient impacts to water, and an almost total
pathogen kill in the waste stream. Further, the economics of producing these cattle (including the cost of the facility/technology upgrade)
will be greatly enhanced by the revenue realized from the recovery of valuable resources, including renewable energy, high-value fertilizer
products, and clean water.
A Bion sustainable beef facility will be comprised
of covered barns with slotted floors (allowing the waste to pass through) which will reduce ammonia volatilization and loss, as well as
odors, thereby improving animal health and human working conditions while preventing air/soil pollution. The manure will be collected
and moved directly to anaerobic digestion facilities which will produce renewable natural gas (and re-cycle CO2 from the gas cleaning
process). Covered barns will reduce weather impacts on the livestock and have been demonstrated to promote improved general health and
weight gain in the cattle housed in them. The barns’ very large roof surface area will be utilized (in appropriate geographical
locations) for the installation of photovoltaic solar generation systems to produce electricity for the facility, as well as export to
the grid. The barn roofs will also be configured to capture rainwater, which, coupled with the water recovered from the treatment process,
will reduce the projects’ reliance on current water supplies.
13
Waste treatment and resource recovery will be provided
by Bion’s advanced Gen3Tech platform, which Bion believes offers the most comprehensive solution for livestock waste available today.
In addition to direct environmental benefits, every pound of nitrogen that is captured, upcycled, and returned to the agricultural nitrogen
cycle as high-quality fertilizer (vs lost to contaminate downstream waters), is also a pound of nitrogen that will not have to be produced
as synthetic urea or anhydrous ammonia, with their tremendous carbon cost. System performance and environmental benefits will be monitored
and verified through third parties, with USDA PVP certification of the sustainable brand that Bion also believes will be the most comprehensive
available in the market.
Recently there have been efforts to establish sustainable
brands (including USDA PVP certification) for a number of small-scale livestock producers (largely in the grass-fed beef category). To
date, the reach and extent of such efforts is limited and it is difficult to determine their effectiveness. Additionally, there have
been public announcements of initiatives related to beef sustainability (largely focused on the ‘cow-calf’ segment of the
livestock chain) in procurement by major beef processing companies, but a closer look finds that most consist largely of ‘green
washing’ public proclamations in the wake of environmental and social criticism that re-package prior initiatives and lack any significant
new substance.
Sustainable Organic Beef
Bion believes it has a unique opportunity to produce,
at scale, affordable corn-fed organic beef that is also certified as sustainable. In addition to the sustainable practices described above,
organic-sourced beef cows would be finished on organic corn, which would be produced using the ammonium bicarbonate fertilizer captured
by the Gen3Tech platform. Bion believes its meat products will meet consumer demands with respect to sustainability and safety (organic)
and provide the tenderness and taste American consumers have come to expect from premium conventional American beef. Such products are
largely unavailable in the market today. We believe Bion’s unique ability to produce the fertilizer needed to grow a supply of relatively
low-cost organic corn, and the resulting opportunity to produce organic beef, will dramatically differentiate us from potential competitors.
This organic opportunity is dependent on successfully establishing Bion’s fertilizer products as acceptable for use in organic grain
production.
Today, organic beef demand is limited and mostly supplied
with grass-fed cattle. While organic ground/ chopped meat has enjoyed success in U.S. markets, grass-fed steaks have seen limited acceptance,
mostly resulting from consumer issues with taste and texture. In other words, it’s tough. Regardless, such steaks sell for a significant
premium over conventional beef. A grain-finished organic beef product is largely unavailable in the marketplace today due to the higher
costs of producing organic corn and grain. The exception is offerings that are very expensive from small ‘boutique’ beef producers.
Like all plants, corn requires nitrogen to grow. Corn is especially sensitive to a late-season application of readily available nitrogen
– the key to maximizing yields. With non-organic field corn, this nitrogen is supplied by an application of a low-cost synthetic
fertilizer, such as urea or anhydrous ammonia. However, the cost for suitable nitrogen fertilizer that can be applied late-season in organic
corn production is so high that the late-season application becomes uneconomical, resulting in substantially lower yields – a widely
recognized phenomena known as the ‘yield gap’ in organic production. The yield gap results in higher costs for organic corn
that, in turn, make it uneconomical to feed that corn to livestock. As is the case for sustainable but not organic beef, Bion believes
there is a potentially large unmet demand for affordable beef products that are both sustainable AND organic, but with the taste and texture
consumers have come to expect from American beef. Bion’s ability to produce the low-cost nitrogen fertilizer that can close the
organic yield (and affordability) gap puts the Company in a unique, if not exclusive at this time, position to participate in JV’s
that will benefit from this opportunity starting next year.
The demonstrated willingness of consumers to purchase
sustainable products (along with numerous research and marketing studies confirming consumers are seeking, and are willing to pay a premium
for, sustainable products)---in combination with the threat to the livestock industry market (primarily beef and pork) posed by plant-based
alternatives (heightened by pandemic conditions)--- has succeeded in focusing the large scale livestock industry on how to meet the plant-based
market challenge by addressing the consumer sustainability issues. The consumer demand for sustainability appears to be a real and lasting
trend, but consumers remain skeptical of generalized claims of ‘sustainability’. To date, a large portion of the industry
responses to this trend have been at a superficial level or consist of ‘green washing’, a deceptive marketing practice where
companies promote non-substantive initiatives. Real sustainability for the livestock industry will require implementation of advanced
waste treatment technology at or near the CAFOs – where most of the negative environmental impacts take place.
Organic Fertilizer
The Company has focused a large portion of its activities
on developing, testing and demonstrating the 3rd generation of its technology and technology platform (“Gen3Tech”) with emphasis
on increasing the efficiency of production of valuable co-products from the waste treatment process, including ammonia nitrogen in the
form of low carbon and/or organically certified soluble nitrogen fertilizer products. The Company’s initial ammonium bicarbonate
liquid product completed its Organic Materials Review Institute (“OMRI”) application and review process with approval during
May 2020. The Company intends to file an application for a second, higher concentration (9-10%) liquid ammonium bicarbonate product line
during the current year based on product produced during operation of the Initial Project.
14
Ammonium bicarbonate, manufactured using chemical
processes, has a long history of use as a fertilizer. Bion’s Gen3Tech recovers solid ammonium bicarbonate products containing 18-22
percent nitrogen in a crystalline form that is easily transported (while producing liquids with various percentages of ammonium bicarbonate
nitrogen during interim stages of the process), is water soluble and provides a readily available nitrogen source for crops. This product
line will contain virtually none of the other salt, iron and mineral constituents of the livestock waste stream that often accompany other
organic fertilizers. This product is being developed to fertilizer industry standards so that it that can be precision-applied to crops
using existing equipment. Bion believes that this product will potentially have broad applications in the production of organic grains
for livestock feed, row crops, horticulture, greenhouse and hydroponic production, and potentially retail lawn and garden products.
The ammonium bicarbonate products produced by Bion’s
Gen3Tech platform will enjoy a dramatically lower carbon footprint than synthetic fertilizers. The reactive nitrogen captured and upcycled
into our fertilizer products was going to be lost through volatilization and runoff, and that loss would generally need to be offset with
a synthetic nitrogen, such as anhydrous ammonia or urea. These synthetic nitrogen products are produced through the Haber-Bosch (and other)
synthetic processes, which converts hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, with methane as the energy source. It is an extremely
energy-intensive process with a carbon footprint that, while not yet fully understood, is widely accepted to by very large. While a complete
Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of carbon impacts from synthetic fertilizer production is not available, according to the Institute for Industrial
Productivity, its production alone is responsible for approximately 1 percent of total global CO2 emissions. To the extent that Bion can
capture and repurpose the nitrogen traditionally lost from livestock waste, that carbon cost will no longer need to be paid.
Applications for our first solid form of concentrated
ammonia, soluble nitrogen fertilizer product line have been filed with OMRI (filed during May 2021), the Iowa Organic Program (“IOP”)(filed
during March 2022) and the California Department of Food & Agriculture (“CDFA”)(filed during May 2022) and are each in
the review process. The review processes have and are likely to continue to require an extended period of time and multiple procedural
steps with each entity in part due to the novel nature of Bion’s Gen3Tech and our solid ammonium bicarbonate product in the context
of organic certifications. The OMRI application has proceeded through multiple stages of review and rebuttal/appeal without receiving
a positive result to date and the Company is currently evaluating how next to proceed (potential choices include “Judicial Dispute
Resolution” as set forth in the OMRI Policy Manual, appeal to the USDA’s National Organic Program (“NOP”),, or
other approaches. The Company’s has filed responses to the CDFA’s questions and comments regarding our solid ammonium bicarbonate
product line and is waiting on further communication. The Company’s solid product line is novel in part due to the fact that there
is not a formal listing category for a solid form of concentrated ammonia, soluble nitrogen fertilizers and there is no clear guidance
at present from internal policy manuals on how to categorize this product and the process that produced it. There is also no clear guidance
at present from either the NOP or the National Organic Standards Board (“NOSB”) (which is currently involved in a related
review and recommendations process regarding ‘high nitrogen liquid fertilizers’ derived from ammonia from manure). The Company
and its representatives, along with a number of other stakeholders, are involved in discussions regarding resolution of these matters
at all three levels. The Company anticipates positive resolution of this matter with one or more listings/certifications of this product
line well prior to operational dates for the Company’s initial large scale JV Gen3Tech projects.
15
Gen3Tech Kreider 2 Poultry Project
Bion
has done extensive pre-development work related to a waste treatment/renewable energy production facility to treat the waste from KF’s
approximately 6+ million chickens (planned to expand to approximately 9-10 million) (and potentially other poultry operations and/or
other waste streams) ('Kreider Renewable Energy Facility' or ‘Kreider 2 Project’). On May 5, 2016, the Company executed a
stand-alone joint venture agreement (“JVA”) with Kreider Farms covering all matters related to development and operation
of Kreider 2 system to treat the waste streams from Kreider’s poultry facilities in Bion PA2 LLC (“PA2”). Now that
development of the Company’s Gen3Tech is being deployed, the Company has commenced discussions with KF regarding updating and amending
the JV agreement and anticipates executing an amended joint venture agreement during 2023. During May 2011 the PADEP certified a smaller
version of the Kreider 2 Project (utilizing our 2 nd
generation technology) under the old EPA’s Chesapeake Bay model.
The Company anticipates that if and when new designs are finalized utilizing our Gen3Tech, a larger Kreider 2 Project will be re-certified
for a far larger number of credits (management’s current estimates are between 2-4 million (or more) nutrient reduction credits
for treatment of the waste stream from Kreider’s poultry pursuant to the amended EPA Chesapeake Bay model and agreements between
the EPA and PA).
Note that this Project may also be expanded in the future to treat wastes from other local and regional CAFOs
(poultry and/or dairy---including the Kreider Dairy) and/or additional Kreider poultry expansion (some of which may not qualify for nutrient
reduction credits). The Company anticipates if and when PA2 re-commences work on the Kreider 2 Project, it will submit a new application
based on our Gen3Tech. Site specific design and engineering work for this facility have not commenced, and the Company does not yet have
financing in place for the Kreider 2 Project. This opportunity is being pursued through PA2. If there are positive developments related
to the market for nutrient reductions in Pennsylvania, of which there is no assurance, the Company intends to pursue development, design
and construction of the Kreider 2 Project with a goal of achieving operational status for its initial modules during the following calendar
year. The economics (potential revenues and profitability) of the Kreider 2 Project, despite its proposed use of Bion’s Gen3Tech
for increased recovery of marketable by-products and sustainable branding, are based in material part the long-term sale of nutrient
(nitrogen and/or phosphorus) reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up. However, liquidity
in the Pennsylvania nutrient credit market has not yet developed significant breadth and depth, which lack of liquidity has negatively
impacted Bion’s business plans and will most likely delay PA2’s Kreider 2 Project and other proposed projects in Pennsylvania.
Note that while Bion believes that the Kreider 2 Project
and/or subsequent Bion Projects in PA and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed will eventually generate revenue from the sale of: a) nutrient
reductions (credits or in other form), b) renewable energy (and related credits), c) sales of fertilizer products, and/or d) potentially,
in time, credits for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, plus e) license fees/premiums related to a ‘sustainable brand’,
the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed legislative efforts needed to commence its development. However, the Company is currently engaged in
dialogue with the regional EPA office and the Chesapeake Bay Program Office regarding the potential of the Company’s Gen3Tech Kreider2
Project (and other potential projects) to enable Pennsylvania to move forward toward meeting its Chesapeake Bay clean-up goals. We believe
that the potential market is very large, but it is not possible to predict the exact timing and/or magnitude of these potential markets
at this time.
Technology Deployment: Bion Gen3Tech
Widespread deployment of waste treatment technology,
and the sustainability it enables, is largely dependent upon generating sufficient additional revenues to offset the capital and operating
costs associated with technology adoption. Bion’s Gen3Tech business platform has been developed to create opportunities for such
augmented revenue streams, while providing third party verification of sustainability claims. The Gen3Tech platform has been designed
to maximize the value of co-products produced during the waste treatment/recovery processes, including pipeline-quality renewable natural
gas (biogas) and commercial fertilizer products approved for organic production. All processes will be verifiable by third parties (including
regulatory authorities and certifying boards) to comply with environmental regulations and trading programs and meet the requirements
for: a) renewable energy and carbon credits, b) organic certification of the fertilizer coproducts and c) USDA PVP certification of an
‘Environmentally Sustainable’ brand (see discussion below), and d) payment for verified ecosystem services. The Company’s
first patent on its Gen3Tech was issued during 2018. In August 2020, the Company received a Notice of Allowance on its third patent which
significantly expands the breadth and depth of the Company’s Gen3Tech coverage, and the Company has additional applications pending
and/or planned.
16
Bion’s business model and technology platform
can create the opportunity for joint ventures
(in various contractual forms)(“JVs”) between the Company and large livestock/food/fertilizer
industry participants based upon the supplemental cash flow generated by implementation of our Gen3Tech business model, which cash flows
will support the costs of technology implementation (including servicing related debt). We anticipate this will result in substantial
long term value for Bion. In the context of such JVs, we believe that the verifiable sustainable branding opportunities (conventional
and organic) in meat will represent the single largest enhanced revenue contributor provided by Bion to the JVs (and Bion licensees).
The Company believes that the largest portion of its business with be conducted through such JVs, but a material portion may involve licensing
and or other approaches.
In parallel with technology development, Bion has
worked (which work continues) to implement market-driven strategies designed to stimulate private-sector participation in the overall
U.S. nutrient and carbon reduction strategy. These market-driven strategies can generate “payment for ecosystem services”,
in which farmers or landowners are rewarded for managing their land and operations to provide environmental benefits that will generate
additional revenues. Existing renewable energy credits for the production and use of biogas are an example of payment for ecosystem services.
Another such strategy is nutrient trading (or water quality trading), which will potentially create markets (in Pennsylvania and other
states) that will utilize taxpayer funding for the purchase of verified pollution reductions from agriculture (“nutrient credits”)
by the state (or others) through competitively-bid procurement programs. Such credits can then be used as a ‘qualified offset’
by an individual state (or municipality) to meet its federal clean water mandates at significantly lower cost to the taxpayer. Market-driven
strategies, including competitive procurement of verified credits, is supported by U.S. EPA, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, national livestock
interests, and other key stakeholders. Legislation in Pennsylvania to establish the first such state competitive procurement program passed
the Pennsylvania Senate by a bi-partisan majority during March 2019 but has not yet crossed the hurdles required for actual adoption.
The Covid-19 pandemic and related financial/budgetary crises have slowed progress for this and other policy initiatives and, as a result,
it is not currently possible to project the timeline for completion (or meaningful progress) of this and other similar initiatives (see
discussion below).
The livestock industry and its markets are already
changing. With our commercial-ready technology and business model, Bion believes it has a ‘first-mover advantage’ over others
that will seek to exploit the opportunities that will arise from the industry’s inevitable transformation. Bion anticipates moving
forward with the development process of its initial commercial installations utilizing its Gen3Tech, during the current 2023 fiscal year.
We believe that Bion’s Gen3Tech platform and business model can provide a pathway to true economic and environmental sustainability
with ‘win-win’ benefits for at least a premium sector of the livestock industry, the environment, and the consumer, an opportunity
which the Company intends to pursue.
The Livestock Problem
The livestock industry is under tremendous pressure
from regulatory agencies, a wide range of advocacy groups, institutional investors and the industry’s own consumers, to adopt sustainable
practices. Environmental cleanup is inevitable and has already begun - and policies have already begun to change, as well. Bion’s
Gen3Tech was developed for implementation on large scale livestock production facilities, where scale drives both lower treatment costs
and efficient co-products production, as well as dramatic environmental improvements. We believe that scale, coupled with Bion’s
verifiable treatment technology platform, will create a transformational opportunity to integrate clean production practices at (or close
to) the point of production—the primary source of the industry’s environmental impacts. Bion intends to assist the forward-looking
segment of the livestock industry to bring animal protein production in line with 21st Century consumer demands for meaningful sustainability.
In the U.S. (according to the USDA’s 2017 agricultural
census) there are over 9 million dairy cows, 90 million beef cattle, 60 million swine and more than 2 billion poultry which provides an
indication of both the scope of the problem addressed by Bion’s technology, as well as the size of Bion’s opportunity. Environmental
impacts from livestock production include surface and groundwater pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, ammonia, and other air pollution,
excess water use, and pathogens related to foodborne illnesses and antibiotic resistance. While the most visible and immediate problems
are related to nutrient runoff and its effects on water quality, the industry has recently been targeted by various stakeholder groups
for its impacts on climate change.
17
Estimates of total annual U.S. livestock manure
waste vary widely, but start around a billion tons, between 100 and 130 times greater than human waste. However, while human waste is
generally treated by septic or municipal wastewater plants, livestock waste – raw manure – is spread on our nation’s
croplands for its fertilizer value. Large portions of U.S. feed crop production (and most organic crop production) are fertilized, in
part, in this manner. Under current manure management practices, 80% or more of total nitrogen from manure, much of it in the form of
ammonia, escapes during storage, transportation, and during and after soil application, representing both substantial lost value and environmental
costs.
More than half of the nitrogen impacts from livestock
waste come from airborne ammonia emissions, which are extremely volatile, reactive and mobile. Airborne ammonia nitrogen eventually settles
back to the ground through atmospheric deposition - it ‘rains’ everywhere. While some of this nitrogen is captured and used
by plants, most of it runs off and enters surface waters or percolates down to groundwater. It is now well-established that most of the
voluntary conservation practices, such as vegetated buffers that ‘filter’ runoff (often referred to as “BMPs”
or “Best Management Practices” that have traditionally been implemented to attempt to mitigate nutrient runoff), are considerably
less effective than was previously believed to be the case. This is especially true with regard to addressing the volatile and mobile
nitrogen from ammonia emissions, because BMPs are primarily focused on surface water runoff, directly from farm fields in current production,
versus the re-deposition that takes place everywhere or groundwater flow.
Runoff from livestock waste has been identified in
most of our major watersheds as a primary source of excess nutrients that fuel algae blooms in both fresh and saltwater. Over the last
several years, algae blooms have become increasingly toxic to both humans and animals, such as the Red Tides on the Florida and California
coasts, and the Lake Erie algae bloom that cut off the water supply to Toledo, Ohio, residents in 2014. When the nutrient runoff subsides,
it leaves the algae blooms with no more ‘food’ and the blooms die. The algae’s decomposition takes oxygen from the water,
leading to ‘dead zones’ in local ponds, lakes, and ultimately, the Great Lakes, as well as the Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of Mexico,
and other estuary waters. Both the toxic algae blooms and the low/no-oxygen dead zones devastate marine life, from shrimp and fish to
higher mammals, including dolphins and manatees. U.S. EPA already considers excess nutrients “one of America’s most widespread,
costly and challenging environmental problems”. Nutrient runoff is expected to worsen dramatically in the coming decades due to
rising temperatures and increasing rainstorm intensity as a result of climate change.
Nitrate-contaminated groundwater is of growing concern
in agricultural regions nationwide, where it has been directly correlated with nutrient runoff from upstream agricultural operations using
raw manure as fertilizer. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, California and Washington, and others, now have regions where groundwater nitrate levels
exceed EPA standards for safe drinking water. High levels of nitrate can cause blue baby syndrome (methemoglobinemia) in infants and affect
women who are or may become pregnant, and it has been linked to thyroid disease and colon cancer. EPA has set an enforceable standard
called a maximum contaminant level (MCL) in water for nitrates at 10 parts per million (ppm) (10 mg/L) and for nitrites at 1 ppm (1 mg/L).
Federal regulations require expensive pretreatment for community water sources that exceed the MCL; however, private drinking water
wells are not regulated, and it is the owners’ responsibility to test and treat their wells. Additionally, groundwater flows also
transport this volatile nitrogen downstream where, along its way, it intermixes with surface water, further exacerbating the runoff problem.
Like atmospheric deposition, the current conservation practices we rely on to reduce agricultural runoff are largely bypassed by this
subsurface flow.
Additionally, in arid climates, such as California,
airborne ammonia emissions from livestock manure contribute to air pollution as a precursor to PM2.5 formation, small inhalable particulate
matter that is a regulated air pollutant with significant public health risks. Whether airborne or dissolved in water, ammonia can only
be cost-effectively controlled and treated at the source-- before it has a chance to escape into the environment where it becomes extremely
expensive to ‘chase’, capture, and treat.
18
High phosphorus concentrations in soils fertilized
with raw manure are another growing problem. The ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in livestock waste is fixed, and because manure application
rates are calculated based on nitrogen requirements, often phosphorus is overapplied as an unintended consequence. Phosphorus accumulation
in agricultural soils reduces its productivity, increases the risk of phosphorus runoff, and represents a waste of a finite resource.
Decoupling the nitrogen from the phosphorus would allow them to be precision-applied, independently of each other, when and where needed.
The livestock industry has recently come under heavy
fire for its impacts on climate change, which has become a rallying cry for the anti-meat campaign discussed above. Estimates of the magnitude
of those impacts vary widely, but the general consensus is that globally, livestock account for 14.5 percent of greenhouse emissions.
In the U.S. however, that number drops to 4.2 percent, due to the increased efficiencies of American beef production. The greatest impacts
come from direct emissions of methane from enteric fermentation (belches), methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the manure, with arguably
the largest being the massive carbon footprint of the synthetic nitrogen fertilizers used to grow the grains to feed the livestock.
For decades the livestock industry has overlooked
and/or socialized its environmental problems and costs. Today, the impacts of livestock production on public health and the environment
can no longer be ignored and are coming under increasing scrutiny from environmental groups and health organizations, regulatory agencies
and the courts, the media, consumers, and activist institutional investors. The result has been a significant and alarming loss of market
share to plant-based protein and other alternative products. Bion’s Gen3Tech platform was designed to resolve these environmental
issues and bring the industry in line with twenty-first century consumer expectations.
Going concern and management’s plans:
The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not generated significant revenues and has incurred
net losses of approximately $ 3,451,000
during the year ended June 30, 2021 and a net income of $ 8,291,000
for the year ended June 30, 2022. The net income for the year ended June 30, 2022 was largely due to a one-time, non-cash event of
the dissolution of PA-1 resulting in a gain of approximately $ 10,235,000
as well as a one-time gain of $ 902,490
from the sale of the Company’s ‘biontech.com’ domain pursuant to a purchase agreement during the period. The
Company incurred a net loss of $ 1,649,000
for the six months ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company has a working capital deficit and a
stockholders’ deficit of approximately $ 58,000
and $1,574,000,
1,574,447
respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The following paragraphs describe management’s plans with regard to these conditions.
The Company continues to explore sources of additional
financing (including potential agreements with strategic partners – both financial and ag-industry) to satisfy its current and future
operating and capital expenditure requirements as it is not currently generating any significant revenues.
During the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the
Company received gross proceeds of approximately $ 1,737,000
and $ 5,209,000 , respectively, from the sale of its debt and equity securities.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company received total
proceeds of approximately $ 602,000
from the sale of its equity securities.
During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Company faced
less difficulty in raising equity funding (but was subject to substantial equity dilution from the larger amounts of equity financing
during the periods) than was experienced in the prior 3 years. During the first six months of the current fiscal year, the Company has
raised limited equity funds to meet its some of its immediate needs but will need to raise additional funds in the coming periods. The
Company anticipates substantial increases in demands for capital and operating expenditures during the second half of the current fiscal
year and thereafter as it moves toward commercial implementation of its 3G Tech and development of JVs (including costs associated with
additions of personnel to carry out the business activities of the Company) and, therefore, is likely to continue to face significant
cash flow management challenges due to limited capital resources and working capital constraints which have only recently begun to be
alleviated. To partially mitigate these working capital constraints, the Company’s core senior management and several key employees
and consultants have been deferring (and continue to defer) portions of their cash compensation and/or are accepting compensation in part
in the form of securities of the Company and/or converting portions of their compensation and deferred compensation to securities of the
Company (Notes 5 and 7) and members of the Company’s senior management have made loans to the Company from time to time. During
the year ended June 30, 2018, senior management and certain core employees and consultants agreed to a one-time extinguishment of liabilities
owed by the Company which in aggregate totaled $ 2,404,000 . Additionally, the Company made reductions in its personnel during the years
ended June 30, 2014 and 2015 and again during the year ended June 30, 2018. The constraint on available resources has had, and continues
to have, negative effects on the pace and scope of the Company’s efforts to develop its business. At times, the Company has had
to delay payment of trade obligations and has had to economize in many ways that have potentially negative consequences. If the Company
is able to continue its recent relative success in its efforts to raise needed funds during the remainder of the current fiscal year (and
subsequent periods), of which there is no assurance, management will not need to consider deeper cuts (including additional personnel
cuts) and curtailment of ongoing activities including research and development activities.
19
The Company will need to obtain additional capital
to fund its operations and technology development, to satisfy existing creditors, to develop Projects (including the Initial Project,
JV Projects (including the Dalhart and Olson Projects),and the Kreider 2 facility) and CAFO Retrofit waste remediation systems. The Company
anticipates that it will seek to raise from $ 20,000,000
to $ 80,000,000
or more debt and/or equity through joint ventures, strategic partnerships
and/or sale of its equity securities (common, preferred and/or hybrid) and/or debt (including convertible) securities, and/or through
use of ‘rights’ and/or warrants (new and/or existing) and/or through other means during the next twelve months. However, as
discussed above, there is no assurance, especially in light of the difficulties the Company has experienced in many recent years and the
extremely unsettled capital markets that presently exist for small companies like us, that the Company will be able to obtain the funds
that it needs to stay in business, complete its technology development or to successfully develop its business and Projects.
There is no realistic likelihood that funds required
during the next twelve months (or in the periods immediately thereafter) for the Company’s basic operations, the Initial Project
and/or proposed JVs and/or Projects will be generated from operations. Therefore, the Company will need to raise sufficient funds from
external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of sufficient additional capital resulting from
the inability to generate cash flow from operations and/or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially
curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Further, there can be no assurance that
any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significantly dilutive effect
on the Company’s existing shareholders. All of these factors have been exacerbated by the extremely limited and unsettled credit
and capital markets presently existing for small companies like Bion.
Covid-19 pandemic related matters:
The Company faces risks and uncertainties and factors
beyond our control that are magnified during the current Covid-19 pandemic and the unique economic, financial, governmental and health-related
conditions in which the Company, the country and the entire world now reside. To date the Company has experienced direct impacts in various
areas including but without limitation: i) government ordered shutdowns which have slowed the Company’s research and development
projects and other initiatives, ii) shifted focus of state and federal governments which is likely to negatively impact the Company’s
legislative initiatives in Pennsylvania and Washington D. C., iii) strains and uncertainties in both the equity and debt markets which
have made discussion and planning of funding of the Company and its initiatives and projects with investment bankers, banks and potential
strategic partners more tenuous, iv) strains and uncertainties in the agricultural sector and markets have made discussion and planning
more difficult as future industry conditions are now more difficult to assess and predict, v) constraints due to problems experienced
in the global industrial supply chain since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which have delayed certain research and development testing
and have delayed and/or increased the cost of construction of the Company’s initial 3G Tech installation as equipment/services remain
difficult to acquire in a timely manner, vi) due to the age and health of our core management team, many of whom are age 70 or older and
have had one or more existing health issues (including brief periods of Covid-19 infection), the Covid-19 pandemic places the Company
at greater risk than was previously the case (to a higher degree than would be the case if the Company had a larger, deeper and/or younger
core management team), and vii) there almost certainly will be other unanticipated consequences for the Company as a result of the current
pandemic emergency and its aftermath.

2.        SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of consolidation :
The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Bion Integrated Projects Group, Inc., Bion Technologies, Inc., BionSoil, Inc.,
Bion Services, Bion PA2 LLC and Bion 3G-1 LLC (“3G1”); and its
58.9 % owned subsidiary, Centerpoint Corporation (“Centerpoint”).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Bion PA1 LLC was dissolved on December 29, 2021 (See
Note 5). Its operating losses are included in the consolidation through December 29, 2021.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring entries) that, in the opinion of management,
are necessary to present fairly the financial position at December 31, 2022, the results of operations of the Company for the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the cash flows of the Company for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Operating
results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ending June 30, 2023.
Cash and cash equivalents :
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 there are
no
cash equivalents.
Property and equipment :
Property and equipment are
stated at cost and are depreciated, when placed into service, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, generally three to twenty years. The Company capitalizes all direct costs and all indirect incrementally identifiable costs related
to the design and construction of its Integrated Projects such as consulting fees, internal salaries and benefits and interest. The Company
reviews its property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the assets or
asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, and is recognized as a loss from operations.
Patents :
The Company has elected to expense all costs and
filing fees related to obtaining patents (resulting in no related asset being recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets)
because the Company believes such costs and fees are immaterial (in the context of the Company’s total costs/expenses) and have
no direct relationship to the value of the Company’s patents.
Stock-based compensation :
The Company follows the provisions of Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 718, which generally requires that share-based compensation transactions be accounted and recognized
in the statement of operations based upon their grant date fair values.
Derivative Financial Instruments :
Pursuant to ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”
(“Topic 815”), the Company reviews all financial instruments for the existence of features which may require fair value accounting
and a related mark-to-market adjustment at each reporting period end. Once determined, the Company assesses these instruments as derivative
liabilities. The fair value of these instruments is adjusted to reflect the fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase
or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives.
21
Options :
The Company has issued options to employees and consultants
under the 2006 Plan to purchase common shares of the Company. Options are valued on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The expected volatility is based on the historical price volatility of the Company’s common stock. The dividend yield represents
the Company’s anticipated cash dividend on common stock over the expected term of the stock options. The U.S. Treasury bill rate
for the expected term of the stock options was utilized to determine the risk-free interest rate. The expected term of stock options represents
the period of time the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding based upon management’s estimates.
Warrants :
The Company has issued warrants to purchase common
shares of the Company. Warrants are valued using a fair value based method, whereby the fair value of the warrant is determined at the
warrant issue date using a market-based option valuation model based on factors including an evaluation of the Company’s value as
of the date of the issuance, consideration of the Company’s limited liquid resources and business prospects, the market price of
the Company’s stock in its mostly inactive public market and the historical valuations and purchases of the Company’s warrants.
When warrants are issued in combination with debt or equity securities, the warrants are valued and accounted for based on the relative
fair value of the warrants in relation to the total value assigned to the debt or equity securities and warrants combined.
Concentrations of credit risk :
The Company's financial instruments that are exposed
to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash. The Company's cash is in demand deposit accounts placed with federally insured financial
institutions and selected brokerage accounts. Such deposit accounts at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
experienced any losses on such accounts.
Noncontrolling interests :
In accordance with ASC 810, “Consolidation”,
the Company separately classifies noncontrolling interests within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and separately
reports the amounts attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition,
the noncontrolling interest continues to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling
interest balance.
Fair value measurements :
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the
principal or most advantageous market. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that has three levels of inputs, both observable and unobservable,
with use of the lowest possible level of input to determine fair value.
Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – observable inputs other than Level
1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in
markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and
Level 3 – assets and liabilities whose significant
value drivers are unobservable.
Observable inputs are based on market data obtained
from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s market assumptions. Unobservable inputs require significant
management judgment or estimation. In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the
fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified using the lowest level of input that
is significant to the fair value measurement. Such determination requires significant management judgment.
The fair value of cash and accounts payable approximates
their carrying amounts due to their short-term maturities. The fair value of the loan payable is indeterminable at this time due to the
nature of the arrangement with a state agency and the fact that it is in default. The fair value of the redeemable preferred stock approximates
its carrying value due to the dividends accrued on the preferred stock which are reflected as part of the redemption value. The fair value
of the deferred compensation and convertible notes payable - affiliates are not practicable to estimate due to the related party nature
of the underlying transactions.
22
Lease Accounting :
The Company accounts for leases under ASC 842,  Leases  (“ASC
842”). Accordingly, the Company will determine whether an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. If a
lease is determined to exist, the term of such lease is assessed based on the date on which the underlying asset is made available for
the Company’s use by the lessor. The Company’s assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancelable term of the lease,
inclusive of any rent-free periods and/or periods covered by early-termination options which the Company is reasonably certain of not
exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines
lease classification as either operating or finance at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation
reflected in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.
For leases with a term exceeding 12 months,
a lease liability is recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement reflecting the present value of
its fixed minimum payment obligations over the lease term. A corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset equal to the initial
lease liability is also recorded, adjusted for any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the
lease and reduced by any lease incentives received. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a
given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement, as rates
implicit in its leasing arrangements are typically not readily determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate
it would pay to borrow on a secured basis and incorporates the term and economic environment of the associated lease.
Revenue Recognition :
The Company currently does not generate revenue and
if and when the Company begins to generate revenue the Company will comply with the provisions of ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts
with Customers”.
Income (Loss) per share :
Basic income (loss) per share amounts are calculated
using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share assumes the
conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments, such as options or warrants, unless the effect is to reduce
the income (loss) per share or increase the earnings per share. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
basic and diluted income (loss) per share was the same, as the impact of potential dilutive common shares was anti-dilutive.
The following table represents the warrants and options
(as if exercised) and convertible securities (as if converted) that have been excluded from the calculation of basic income (loss) per
share:

Use of estimates :
In preparing the Company’s consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements :
The Company continually assesses any new accounting
pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company’s
financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of the change to its consolidated financial statements
and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s consolidated financial statements properly reflect
the change.

5.        LOANS PAYABLE :
Pennvest Loan and Bion PA1 LLC (“PA1”)
Dissolution
PA1, the
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, was dissolved on December 29, 2021 on which date it owed approximately $ 10,010,000
under the terms of the Pennvest Loan related to the construction of the Kreider 1 System including accrued interest and late charges
totaling $ 2,255,802
as of that date. Through the date of the dissolution, PA1 was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and its assets and
liabilities were included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2021, PA1’s total assets were
$ 297
and its total liabilities were $ 10,154,334
(including the Pennvest Loan in the aggregate amount of $ 9,939,148 ,
accounts payable of $ 214,235
and
accrued liabilities of $ 950 )
which sums were included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2021. Subsequent to the dissolution of PA1, its assets and liabilities are no longer consolidated and included in the
Company’s balance sheet. As of December 29, 2021, PA1’s total assets were nil
0
and its total liabilities were
$ 10,234,501
(including the Pennvest Loan in the aggregate amount of $ 10,009,802 , accounts payable of $ 212,263
and accrued
liabilities of $ 12,436 ). The net amount of $ 10,234,501
was recognized as a gain on the legal dissolution of a subsidiary in other
(income) expense.
As background, the terms
of the Pennvest Loan provided for funding of up to $ 7,754,000
which was to be repaid by interest-only payments for three years, followed
by an additional ten-year amortization of principal. The Pennvest Loan accrued interest at
2.547 % per annum for years 1 through 5 and
3.184 % per annum for years 6 through maturity. The Pennvest Loan required minimum annual principal payments of approximately $ 5,886,000
in fiscal years 2013 through 2021, and $ 846,000
in fiscal year 2022, $ 873,000
in fiscal year 2023 and $ 149,000
in fiscal year 2024. The
Pennvest Loan was collateralized by PA1’s Kreider 1 System and by a pledge of all revenues generated from Kreider 1 including, but
not limited to, revenues generated from nutrient reduction credit sales and by-product sales. In addition, in consideration for the excess
credit risk associated with the project, Pennvest was entitled to participate in the profits from Kreider 1 calculated on a net cash flow
basis, as defined. The Company has incurred interest expense related to the Pennvest Loan of $ 123,444
and $ 246,887
for the years ended
June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the limited development of the depth and breadth of the Pennsylvania nutrient reduction
credit market, PA1 commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring the obligations under
the Pennvest Loan during 2013. In the context of such negotiations, PA1 elected not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest
Loan since January 2013. Additionally, the PA1 did not make any principal payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and, therefore,
the Company classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability through the dissolution of PA1 on December 29, 2021.
25
During August 2012, the Company
provided Pennvest (and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 system met the ‘technology guaranty’ standards
which were incorporated in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan has been solely an obligation of PA1 since
that date. Note, however, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 reflects the Pennvest Loan as a liability
of $ 9,868,495
despite the fact that the obligation (if any) was solely an obligation of PA1 .
On September 25, 2014, the
Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (“Pennvest”) exercised its right to declare the PA1’s Pennvest Loan
in default, accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $ 8,137,117
(principal, interest plus late charges) on or before October
24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and did/does not have the resources to make the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 commenced discussions
and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest rejected PA1’s proposal made during the fall of 2014. PA1 made
a final proposal to Pennvest during September 2021 which proposal was also rejected by Pennvest. PA1 provided Pennvest with its financial
statements (which include a description of system status) annually. During the 2021 fiscal year, Pennvest’s auditors requested a
‘corrective action plan’ and PA1 informed Pennvest that “… there is no viable corrective action plan for the
Pennvest Loan (‘Loan’). The facility funded by the Loan has been shut down for many years (which has been disclosed in the
annual financial reports to Pennvest and in public filings by the parent of Bion PA 1, LLC) and the technology utilized in the facility
is now obsolete. The facility has not been commercially operated for approximately six years and has generated zero income. We recommend
that Pennvest take appropriate steps to remove and sell the equipment.” Pennvest responded favorably to the approach of selling
the equipment.
On December 29, 2021, the
Company approved and executed a ‘Consent of the Sole Member of Bion PA 1’ (the “Consent to Dissolution”) that
authorized the complete liquidation and dissolution of PA1. A Statement of Dissolution was filed by PA1 with the Colorado Secretary of
State on December 29, 2021.The liquidation value of Bion PA 1’s property is substantially below the current amount outstanding under
the Funding Agreement dated October 27, 2010 by and between PA1 and Pennvest, the only known secured creditor of PA1. Post-dissolution,
PA1’s activities will be limited entirely to activities required to properly distribute its net assets to creditors and wind down
its business.
PA1 and Pennvest agreed to
have the equipment sold by a third party auctioneer who arranged for the sale of its property and delivery of all proceeds (net of commissions
and customary costs of sale) to Pennvest. The auction took place during the period of May 13-18, 2022. The Company’s personnel assisted
PA1 with this process as needed at no cost to PA1. The net sum of $ 104,725
was realized from the asset sale, which sum was delivered
to Pennvest on June 15, 2022. Pursuant to agreement with Pennvest and Kreider Farms, the remaining unsold assets have been transferred
to Kreider Farms in order to complete the winding up of the Kreider 1 project.
Upon the complete distribution
of all assets of PA1, whether by transfer or sale and distribution of net proceeds as provided above, PA1 will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the cessation of all activities. No distributions of PA1’s assets will be made to the Company or its affiliates.
The Consent to Dissolution authorized Mark A. Smith, the Company’s President and the sole manager of PA1, to cause to be delivered
for filing the Statement of Dissolution, to give notice of the dissolution, and to take any other act necessary to wind up and liquidate
the business.
PA1 has made no payments
to vendors or other creditors in connection with the dissolution other than the payment to Pennvest described above. No distributions
or payments of any kind have ever been made to the Company, the sole member of PA1 since inception and no payment will be made to the
Company or any affiliate in connection with the dissolution.
For more information regarding
the history and background of the Pennvest Loan and PA1, please review our Form’s 10-K for the years from 2008 through 2021 including
the Notes to the Financial Statements included therein.

6.        CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE
- AFFILIATES :
2020 Convertible Obligations
The 2020 Convertible Obligations, which accrue interest
at either
4 % per annum or
4 % compounded quarterly and effective January 1, 2020 are due and payable on July 1, 2024. The 2020 Convertible
Obligations (including accrued interest, plus all future deferred compensation added subsequently), are convertible, at the sole election
of the holder, into Units consisting of one share of the Company’s common stock and one half to one warrant to purchase a share
of the Company’s common stock, at a price of $ 0.50
per Unit until July 1, 2024. The original conversion price of $ 0.50
per Unit
approximated the fair value of the Units at the date of the agreements; therefore, no beneficial conversion feature exists. Management
evaluated the terms and conditions of the embedded conversion features based on the guidance of ASC 815-15 “Embedded Derivatives”
to determine if there was an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. An embedded derivative instrument (such as a conversion option
embedded in the deferred compensation) must be bifurcated from its host instruments and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument
only if the “risks and rewards” of the embedded derivative instrument are not “clearly and closely related” to
the risks and rewards of the host instrument in which it is embedded. Management concluded that the embedded conversion feature of the
deferred compensation was not required to be bifurcated because the conversion feature is clearly and closely related to the host instrument,
and because of the Company’s limited trading volume that indicates the feature is not readily convertible to cash in accordance
with ASC 815-10, “Derivatives and Hedging”.
As of December 31, 2022, the 2020 Convertible Obligation
balances, including accrued interest, owed Bassani Family Trusts (and his donees), Smith and Edward Schafer (“Schafer”), a
director of the Company, were $ 2,644,553 , $ 1,388,421
and $ 508,352 , respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the 2020 Convertible Obligation
balances, including accrued interest, owed Bassani Family Trusts, Smith and Schafer were $ 2,550,104 , $ 1,302,049
and $ 490,197 , respectively.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, Smith
elected to add $ 60,000
of his salary to his 2020 Convertible Obligations.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, Smith
elected to convert $ 30,000
in principal of the 2020 Convertible Obligation to
60,000
units ( 60,000
common shares and
60,000
warrants)
and $ 20,000
of accrued interest of the 2020 Convertible Obligation to
40,000
units ( 40,000
common shares and
40,000
warrants).
The Company recorded interest expense of $ 41,373
and $ 40,864
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded interest expense of $ 82,740
and $ 81,424
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company capitalized $ 35,416
and nil
0
related to the 3G project for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company capitalized $ 66,104
and nil
0
related to the 3G project for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
See Note 10 Subsequent Events below for an adjustment made to some
of the 2020 Convertible Notes which reduced the principal owing and the conversion prices.
September 2015 Convertible Notes
During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company entered
into September 2015 Convertible Notes with Bassani (now owned by Bassani Family Trusts), Schafer and a Shareholder which replaced previously
issued promissory notes. The September 2015 Convertible Notes bear interest at
4 % per annum, have maturity dates of July 1, 2024, and
may be converted at the sole election of the noteholders into restricted common shares of the Company at a conversion price of $ 0.60
per
share. As the conversion price of $0.60 approximated the fair value of the common shares at the date of the September 2015 Convertible
Notes, no beneficial conversion feature exists.
The balances of the September 2015 Convertible Notes
as of December 31, 2022, including accrued interest owed Bassani Family Trusts, Schafer and Shareholder, are $ 284,211 , $ 21,173
and $ 453,314 ,
respectively. The balances of the September 2015 Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2021, including accrued interest, were $ 274,521 ,
$ 20,517
and $ 438,198 , respectively.
The Company recorded interest expense of $ 6,366
and
$ 5,968
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded interest expense of $ 12,731
and $ 11,064
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
See Note 10 Subsequent Events below for an adjustment
made to some of the 2015 Convertible Notes which reduced the principal owing and the conversion prices.

Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per
share on all matters to be voted on by common stockholders. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the
holders of common stock are entitled to share in all assets remaining after liabilities have been paid in full or set aside and the rights
of any outstanding preferred stock have been satisfied. Common stock has no preemptive, redemption or conversion rights. The rights of
holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred
stock or any series of preferred stock the Company may designate in the future.

Company’s Chief Operating Officer (‘COO’) and formerly the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’),
(any reference to Brightcap or Bassani for all purposes are the same individual). The Board appointed Bassani as the Company's CEO effective
May 13, 2011. On February 10, 2015, the Company executed an Extension Agreement with Bassani pursuant to which Bassani extended the term
of his service to the Company to December 31, 2017, (with the Company having an option to extend the term an additional six months.) Pursuant
to the Extension Agreement, Bassani continued to defer his cash compensation ($ 31,000

per month, which will continue to be accrued in
part until there is adequate cash available. Additionally, the Company has agreed to pay him $ 2,000
per month to be applied to life insurance
premiums (which sums have been accrued as liabilities). On August 1, 2018, in the context of extending his agreement to provide services
to the Company on a full-time basis through December 31, 2022) plus 2 years after that on a part-time basis, the Company received an interest

2022.  O’Neill had previously been working with the Company as a consultant and had been employed by the Company as its
CEO during 2010-2011. Bassani, CEO of the Company since 2011, has assumed the position of COO while retaining existing
operational management responsibilities and working with O’Neill on ‘commercialization’ of the Company’s
technology and work related to JVs (and other transactions) based on the Company’s Gen3Technology and related matters.
Bassani’s compensation arrangements with the Company have not been altered in the context of the change of positions. The
Company and O’Neill have entered into a thirty-seven (37) month employment agreement (subject to Board renewal for the final
two (2) years during the 13 th  month) with compensation of $ 25,000
cash and $ 10,000
deferred compensation per month. The cash payment is paid $ 12,500

cancelled if O’Neill is not renewed at 13 months and/or fails to serve the entire contract term thereafter. These warrants

Purchase Order Agreement:
On
January 28, 2022 Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc. (‘Bion’), on behalf of Bion 3G1 LLC (‘3G1’), a wholly-owned
subsidiary, entered into a Purchase Order Agreement with Buflovak and Hebeler Process Solutions (collectively ‘Buflovak’)
in the amount of $ 2,665,500
(and made the initial
25 % payment ($ 666,375 )) for the core of the ‘Bion System’ portion (without
the crystallization  modules which will be ordered and fabricated pursuant to subsequent agreements) of the previously announced
3G Tech Initial Project. This Purchase Order encompasses the core of Bion’s 3G Technology. On March 21, 2022 the Company received
progress notice re: completion of certain work in process and an invoice from Buflovak for the next
25 % payment ($ 666,375 ).  On
June 6, 2022 the Company received progress notice re: completion of certain work in process and an invoice from Buflovak for the next
25% payment ($666,375) which was paid on July 5, 2022 bringing the aggregate payments to $ 1,999,125
as of the date of this filing. No
invoices were received in the quarters ended September 30, 2022 or December 31, 2022. Buflovak has worked with the Company on design and
testing of its 3G Tech over several years. The basic design for the Initial Project’s Bion System is complete and procurement/fabrication
has now been initiated.  3G1 is working in concert with Integrated Engineering Services, the primary site engineering firm for the
facility, on the integration of all project components/modules at the Initial Project site. Additional agreements have been entered into
various professional services providers (engineers, surveyors, etc.) for work related to the Initial Project.
Litigation:
A: Website: Domain Sale/Resolved
Litigation/Hacking/Theft
On March 23,
2022
the Company entered into an agreement to sell domain name <biontech.com> and other related assets to BioNTech SE (“BNTX”)
for the sum of $950,000 (before expenses related to the transaction) which sale was closed/completed on April 2, 2022 with a one-time
gain of $902,490.
The Company has been using www.bionenviro.com as its primary website (and domain) since July 2021 due to the
events described below. The Company has not been using biontech.com as its primary website since July 2021 so domain name <biontech.com>
no longer represented a core asset of the Company.
As previously reported, on
Saturday morning, July 17, 2021, our historical website domain – biontech.com – and email services were compromised
and disabled. Research indicated that an unknown party had ‘hijacked’ the domain in a theft attempt. On September 10, 2021,
the Company filed a federal lawsuit ‘in rem’ to recover the <biontech.com> domain and the unknown ‘John Doe’
who hacked and attempted to steal the website. The litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia, Alexandria Division under the heading ‘Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc., Plaintiff, vs John Doe and <biontech.com>,
Defendants’ (Case No. 1:21-cv-01034), seeking recovery of the domain name and other relief as set forth therein.
On November 19, 2021, the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division issued an order stating that “… ORDERED,
ADJUDGED and Decreed that plaintiff Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc. (‘plaintiff) Is the lawful owner of domain name <biontech.com>
….” under the heading ‘Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc., Plaintiff, vs John Doe and <biontech.com>, Defendants’
(Case No. 1:21-cv-01034). The Company has moved the domain name <biontech.com> to a new registrar and reactivated it for the Company’s
use (paired currently with its current bionenviro.com website).
32
No shareholder, sensitive
or confidential information was available to be breached which has limited damages from the hack/theft to date. However, the Company’s
email operations were subjected to disruption and expenses were incurred related to the matter including legal fees.
The Company created ‘work-arounds’
as a result. These issues have been resolved and the Company has moved our website (and email) to a new domain: bionenviro.com. Website
access is now www.bionenviro.com. To send emails to Bion personnel, one uses the same name identifier previously used, but in the
address, substitute ‘bionenviro.com’ for “biontech.com’: For example cscott@biontech.com (no longer functional)
is cscott@bionenviro.com and mas@biontech.com (no longer functional) is now mas@bionenviro.com.
B: Pennvest Loan and Dissolution
of Bion PA1, LLC (“PA1”)
PA1, the
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, was dissolved on December 29, 2021 on which date it owed approximately $ 10,010,000
under the terms of the Pennvest Loan related to the construction of the Kreider 1 System including accrued interest and late charges
totaling $ 2,255,802
as of that date. Through the date of the dissolution, PA1 was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and its assets and
liabilities were included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2021, PA1’s total assets were
$ 297
and its total liabilities were $ 10,154,334
(including the Pennvest Loan in the aggregate amount of $ 9,939,148 ,
accounts payable of $ 214,235
and
accrued liabilities of $ 950 )
which sums were included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2021. Subsequent to the dissolution of PA1, its assets and liabilities are no longer consolidated and included in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet. As of December 29, 2021, PA1’s total assets were nil
0
and its total liabilities
were $ 10,234,501
(including the Pennvest
Loan in the aggregate amount of $ 10,009,802 ,
accounts payable of $ 212,263
and
accrued liabilities of $ 12,436 ).
The net amount of $ 10,234,501
was recognized as a gain on the legal dissolution of a subsidiary in other (income) expense.
As background, the terms
of the Pennvest Loan provided for funding of up to $ 7,754,000
which was to be repaid by interest-only payments for three years, followed
by an additional ten-year amortization of principal. The Pennvest Loan accrued interest at
2.547 % per annum for years 1 through 5 and
3.184 % per annum for years 6 through maturity. The Pennvest Loan required minimum annual principal payments of approximately $ 5,886,000
in fiscal years 2013 through 2021, and $ 846,000
in fiscal year 2022, $ 873,000
in fiscal year 2023 and $ 149,000
in fiscal year 2024. The
Pennvest Loan was collateralized by PA1’s Kreider 1 System and by a pledge of all revenues generated from Kreider 1 including, but
not limited to, revenues generated from nutrient reduction credit sales and by-product sales. In addition, in consideration for the excess
credit risk associated with the project, Pennvest was entitled to participate in the profits from Kreider 1 calculated on a net cash flow
basis, as defined. The Company has incurred interest expense related to the Pennvest Loan of $ 123,444
and $ 246,887
for the years
ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the limited development of the depth and breadth of the Pennsylvania nutrient
reduction credit market, PA1 commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring the obligations
under the Pennvest Loan during 2013. In the context of such negotiations, PA1 elected not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the
Pennvest Loan since January 2013. Additionally, the PA1 did not make any principal payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and,
therefore, the Company classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability through the dissolution of PA1 on December 29, 2021.
During August 2012, the Company
provided Pennvest (and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 system met the ‘technology guaranty’ standards
which were incorporated in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan has been solely an obligation of PA1 since
that date. Note, however, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 reflects the Pennvest Loan as a liability
of $ 9,868,495
despite the fact that the obligation (if any) was solely an obligation of PA1 .
33
On September 25, 2014, the
Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (“Pennvest”) exercised its right to declare the PA1’s Pennvest Loan
in default, accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $ 8,137,117
(principal, interest plus late charges) on or before October
24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and did/does not have the resources to make the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 commenced discussions
and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest rejected PA1’s proposal made during the fall of 2014. PA1 made
a final proposal to Pennvest during September 2021 which proposal was also rejected by Pennvest. PA1 provided Pennvest with its financial
statements (which include a description of system status) annually. During the 2021 fiscal year, Pennvest’s auditors requested a
‘corrective action plan’ and PA1 informed Pennvest that “… there is no viable corrective action plan for the
Pennvest Loan (‘Loan’). The facility funded by the Loan has been shut down for many years (which has been disclosed in the
annual financial reports to Pennvest and in public filings by the parent of Bion PA 1, LLC) and the technology utilized in the facility
is now obsolete. The facility has not been commercially operated for approximately six years and has generated zero income. We recommend
that Pennvest take appropriate steps to remove and sell the equipment.” Pennvest responded favorably to the approach of selling
the equipment.
On December 29, 2021, the
Company approved and executed a ‘Consent of the Sole Member of Bion PA 1’ (the “Consent to Dissolution”) that
authorized the complete liquidation and dissolution of PA1. A Statement of Dissolution was filed by PA1 with the Colorado Secretary of
State on December 29, 2021.The liquidation value of Bion PA 1’s property is substantially below the current amount outstanding under
the Funding Agreement dated October 27, 2010 by and between PA1 and Pennvest, the only known secured creditor of PA1. Post-dissolution,
PA1’s activities will be limited entirely to activities required to properly distribute its net assets to creditors and wind down
its business.
PA1 and Pennvest agreed to
have the equipment sold by a third party auctioneer who arranged for the sale of its property and delivery of all proceeds (net of
commissions and customary costs of sale) to Pennvest. The auction took place during the period of May 13-18, 2022. The Company’s
personnel assisted PA1 with this process as needed at no cost to PA1. The net sum of $ 104,725
was realized from the asset sale, which
sum was delivered to Pennvest on June 15, 2022. Pursuant to agreement with Pennvest and Kreider Farms, the remaining unsold assets have
been transferred to Kreider Farms in order to complete the winding up of the Kreider 1 project.
Upon the complete distribution
of all assets of PA1, whether by transfer or sale and distribution of net proceeds as provided above, PA1 will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the cessation of all activities. No distributions of PA1’s assets will be made to the Company or its affiliates.

THESE FACTORS INCLUDE ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,
ENTRY OF NEW AND STRONGER COMPETITORS, INADEQUATE CAPITAL AND LIMITED ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING, UNEXPECTED COSTS, FAILURE (OR DELAY)
TO GAIN PRODUCT CERTIFICATIONS AND/OR REGULATORY APPROVALS IN THE UNITED STATES (OR PARTICULAR STATES) OR FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR THE COMPANY’S
PLANNED MEAT AND/OR FERTILIZER PRODUCTS, LOSS (PERMANENTLY OR FOR ANY EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME) OF THE SERVICES OF MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY’S
SMALL CORE MANAGEMENT TEAM (MANY OF WHOM ARE AGE 70 OR OLDER), THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO HANDLE EXTREME GROWTH WITH ITS REQUIREMENTS
FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, SYSTEMS AND CAPITAL, AND FAILURE TO CAPITALIZE UPON ACCESS TO NEW MARKETS. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
THAT MAY AFFECT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT BION'S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS INCLUDE: I) DELAYS AND/OR COSTS EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS
RELATING TO BION'S DEVELOPMENT OF THE INITIAL PROJECT, JVS AND/OR PROJECTS, II) THE POSSIBILITY THAT MARKETS FOR NUTRIENT REDUCTION CREDITS
(DISCUSSED BELOW) AND/OR OTHER WAYS TO MONETIZE NUTRIENT REDUCTIONS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS WILL BE SLOW TO DEVELOP (OR NOT DEVELOP
AT ALL), III) PA1’S DISSOLUTION AND ITS EFFECT ON HOW THE COMPANY IS VIEWED, (IF ANY), IV) THE POSSIBILITY THAT COMPETITORS WILL
DEVELOP MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND/OR LESS EXPENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS, V) DELAYS IN MARKET AWARENESS OF BION AND OUR SYSTEMS, VI) UNCERTAINTIES
AND COSTS INCREASES RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO UPDATE AND IMPROVE BION’S TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS THEREOF,
AND/OR VII) FAILURE OF MARKETING STRATEGIES, EACH OF WHICH COULD HAVE BOTH IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS BY PLACING
US BEHIND OUR COMPETITORS AND REQUIRING EXPENDITURES OF OUR LIMITED RESOURCES.
THESE RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND FACTORS BEYOND OUR
CONTROL ARE MAGNIFIED DURING THE CURRENT UNCERTAIN PERIOD RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE UNIQUE ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, GOVERNMENTAL
AND HEALTH-RELATED CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE WORLD NOW RESIDE.  TO DATE THE COMPANY HAS
EXPERIENCED DIRECT IMPACTS  IN VARIOUS AREAS INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION: I) GOVERNMENT-ORDERED  SHUTDOWNS WHICH HAVE SLOWED
THE COMPANY’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND OTHER INITIATIVES, II) SHIFTED FOCUS OF STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS
LIKELY TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES IN PENNSYLVANIA AND WASHINGTON DC, III) STRAINS AND UNCERTAINTIES
IN BOTH THE EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS HAVE MADE DISCUSSION AND PLANNING OF FUNDING OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS WITH
INVESTMENT BANKERS, BANKS AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIC PARTNERS MORE TENUOUS, IV) STRAINS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND
MARKETS HAVE MADE DISCUSSION AND PLANNING OF FUNDING OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS MORE DIFFICULT AS FUTURE INDUSTRY
CONDITIONS ARE NOW MORE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS/PREDICT, V) CONSTRAINTS DUE TO PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED IN THE GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
WHICH HAVE INCREASED ANTICIPATED PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS, VI) DUE TO THE AGE AND HEALTH OF OUR CORE MANAGEMENT TEAM, MOST OF WHOM ARE
AGE 70 OR OLDER AND HAVE HAD ONE OR MORE EXISTING HEALTH ISSUES, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PLACES THE COMPANY AT GREATER RISK THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY
THE CASE (TO A HIGHER DEGREE THAN WOULD BE THE CASE IF THE COMPANY HAD A LARGER, DEEPER AND/OR YOUNGER CORE MANAGEMENT TEAM), AND VII)
THERE ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL BE OTHER UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC EMERGENCY AND ITS
AFTERMATH.

Bion disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise
any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated
or unanticipated events.
The following discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this Report.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND PLAN
Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc.'s ("Bion,"
"Company," "We," "Us," or "Our") was incorporated in 1987 in the State of Colorado. Bion’s
mission is to create extraordinary value for our shareholders and employees (all of whom own securities in the Company) while delivering
premium, sustainable products to our customers through ventures developing profitable, transparent, and sustainable solutions for livestock
agriculture.
Our patented and proprietary technology provides advanced
waste treatment and resource recovery for large-scale livestock production facilities (also known as “Concentrated Animal Feeding
Operations” or “CAFOs"). Livestock production and its waste, particularly from CAFOs, has been identified as one of the
greatest soil, air, and water quality problems in the U.S. today.  Application of our third generation technology and business/technology
platform (“Gen3Tech”) can largely mitigate these environmental problems, while simultaneously improving operational/ resource
efficiencies by recovering high-value co-products from the CAFOs’ waste stream. These waste stream ‘assets’ –
nutrients and methane – have traditionally been wasted or underutilized and are the same ‘pollutants’ that today fuel
harmful algae blooms, contaminate groundwater, and exacerbate climate change.
Bion’s business model and technology platform
can create the opportunity for joint ventures s (in various contractual forms)(“JVs”) between the Company and large livestock/food/fertilizer
industry participants based upon the supplemental cash flow generated by implementation of our Gen3Tech business model, which cash flows
will support the costs of technology implementation (including servicing related debt). We anticipate this will result in substantial
long term value for Bion. In the context of such JVs, we believe that the verifiable sustainable branding opportunities (conventional
and organic) in meat will represent the single largest enhanced revenue contributor provided by Bion to the JVs (and Bion licensees).
The Company believes that the largest portion of its business with be conducted through such JVs, but a material portion may involve licensing
and or other approaches.
Bion’s Gen3Tech was designed to capture and
stabilize these assets and produce renewable energy, fertilizer products, and clean water as part of the process of raising verifiably
sustainable livestock. All steps and stages in the treatment process will be third-party verified, providing the basis for additional
revenues, including renewable energy-related credits and, eventually, payment for ecosystem services, such as nutrient credits as described
below. The same verified data will be used to substantiate the claims of a USDA-certified sustainable brand that will support premium
pricing for the meat/ animal protein products that are produced in Bion facilities.
During the first half of 2022 Bion began
marketing our sustainable beef to retailers, food service distributors and the meat industry in the U.S.  In general, the response
has been favorable. During July 2022, Bion announced a letter of intent (“Ribbonwire LOI”) to develop a large-scale commercial
project --- a 15,000-head sustainable beef cattle feeding operation together with the Ribbonwire Ranch, in Dalhart, Texas (with a provision
to expand to 60,000 head) (“Dalhart Project”). During January 2023 Bion announced a letter of intent (“Olson LOI”)
to develop a large-scale commercial project --- a 15,000-head sustainable beef cattle feeding operation together with the Olson Feeders
and TD Angus, near North Platte, Nebraska (with a provision to expand to 45,000 head or more) (“Olson Project”). The Olson
Project and the Dalhart Project (and subsequent Projects) will be developed to produce blockchain-verified, sustainable beef in customized
covered barns (with reduced stress on cattle caused by extreme weather and temperatures and resulting higher feed/weight gain efficiency)
with ongoing manure transfer to anaerobic digesters (AD) to both capture nitrogen from the manure stream before loss to the atmosphere
and generating renewable natural gas (RNG) for sale while remediating the environmental impacts associated usually associated with cattle
CAFOs. Bion’s patented Gen3Tech will refine the waste stream into valuable coproducts that include clean water, RNG), photovoltaic
solar electricity and organic fertilizer products. We anticipate converting the Ribbonwire LOI and Olson LOI into a definitive joint
venture agreements and creating distribution agreements with key retailers and food service distributors during the next six to nine
months.
37
Bion’s business model and technology platform can create
the opportunity for joint ventures (in various contractual forms)(“JVs”) between the Company and large livestock/food/fertilizer
industry participants based upon the supplemental cash flow generated by implementation of our Gen3Tech business model, which cash flows
will support the costs of technology implementation (including servicing related debt). We anticipate this will result in substantial
long-term value for Bion. In the context of such JVs, we believe that the verifiable sustainable branding opportunities (conventional
and organic) in meat will represent the single largest enhanced revenue contributor provided by Bion to the JVs (and, in some cases, Bion
licensees). The Company believes that the largest portion of its business with be conducted through such JVs, but a material portion may
involve licensing and or other approaches.
Bion’s Gen3Tech was designed to capture and stabilize
the assets contained in the livestock waste stream and produce renewable energy, fertilizer products, and clean water as part of the process
of raising verifiably sustainable livestock. All steps and stages in the treatment process will be third-party verified, providing the
basis for additional revenues, including renewable energy-related credits and, eventually, payment for ecosystem services, such as nutrient
credits as described below. The same verified data will be used to substantiate the claims of a USDA-certified sustainable brand that
will support premium pricing for the meat/ animal protein products that are produced in Bion facilities.
Our business plan is focused on executing
multiple agreements and letters of intent related to the “Bion Beef Opportunity” and commencing development of multiple
sustainable beef joint venture projects over the next twelve-eighteen (12-18) months while moving forward with the Initial Project
(see below) and the Dalhart and Olson Projects. Bion also intends to pursue other opportunities in the livestock industry enabled by
our Gen3Tech business model. The Ribbonwire and Olson LOI announcement have generated significant interest within the livestock
industry (among ranchers, feedlot operators, farmers and other AG industry parties). We believe that this interest, combined with
consumer interest in ‘sustainable products’ and the growing enthusiasm among some livestock industry parties for
environmental/sustainable/regenerative practices, provides Bion (and its partners/venturers) with an opportunity to move forward
with a truly sustainable solution in this industry segment.
At present, there is essentially no traceable
and verifiable ‘sustainable beef’ available to the US market except for niche products. In response to consumer demand
for transparency and sustainability, Bion expects the meat industry in general, and beef specifically, to evolve towards using new
technologies to deliver these attributes in their products. While we anticipate a faster adoption of tracking, verification and
sustainability technologies in other perishable food categories like produce and dairy due to their harvest and production
techniques, meat industry leaders have also announced their willingness to move forward with initiatives in this area. Bion predicts
that within approximately five years, consumers will be able to track and verify claims including sustainability on 25% (or more) of
the products merchandised in the meat department. Bion believes that the retail market share of verifiably sustainable beef in the
US will approach 7-10 % within three (3) years (end of 2025) and 25% in five (5) years (end of 2027) (approximately 2,000,000 cattle
annually) (and more thereafter). If Bion can successfully execute on its sustainable beef business plan, facilities utilizing
Bion’s Gen3Tech platform will provide one-third (1/3) or more of that of the premium market segment (and a higher portion of
meat that is actually traceable and verifiably sustainable). Our goal is to have multiple sustainable beef projects under
development (within 3-5 distinct JVs) by the end of 2023. Our first commercial project is likely to be either the Dalhart Project or
the Olson Project but we anticipate commencing additional sustainable beef projects during 2023 as well. Our current target is to
have at least three (3) facility modules (15,000 head per module)(“Modules”) in development/under construction during
2023 in three (3) different JVs with the initial barns being populated with livestock by fall/winter 2024-25. Further expansion in
the number of distinct JVs is projected through 2025 aiming at 5-10 JVs in process --- each of which JVs will be pursuing
development of multiple Modules with targets of 12-15 populated Modules by the end of 2025 (approximately 2%-3% of the US beef
market) and 30-45 Modules constructed and populated by 2027-28 (approximately 6%-8% of the US beef market) with further expansion
thereafter. Bion’s current goal is that its Gen3Tech platform will be utilized to produce 33% of the verifiable
“sustainable beef” category at the end of the period (which will equal approximately 2 million cattle annually)(45
Modules).
During this five (5) year period, the Company also
anticipates having additional Gen3Tech projects underway in the pork/dairy/egg sectors of the US animal protein market.
38
During the next three months, the Company intends
to compete construction and begin operations of phase 1 of our Initial Project located near Fair Oaks, Indiana. Bion expects the Initial
Project to provide data that illustrates the effectiveness of our Gen3Tech in a commercial setting by the end of the 2 nd
quarter
in 2023 and supports development of the Dalhart and Olson Projects (and/or other Gen3Tech JV projects) during 2023.  We believe this
data will also provide potential stakeholders (cattle producers, cattle feeders, packers, distributors, retailers and financial institutions)
with the information they need to proceed with confidence in collaborating with Bion on multiple new projects.
Bion is now focused primarily on: i) development/construction/operation
of the Initial Project, our initial commercial-scale Gen3Tech installation, ii) pre-development of the Dalhart and Olson
Projects (and/or other Gen3Tech beef JV projects) iii) developing applications and markets for its sustainable (conventional and organic)
animal protein products (commencing with ‘verifiably sustainable beef’) and its low carbon organic fertilizer products , iv)
discussions regarding initiation and development of agreements and joint ventures (“JVs” as discussed below) (and related
projects) based on the augmented capabilities of our Gen3Tech business platform (in the sustainable beef and other livestock segments),
while (v) continuing to pursue business opportunities related to large retrofit projects (such as the Kreider poultry project JV described
below) and vi) ongoing R&D activities.
There is no assurance that the Company will reach
or approach the goals/targets set forth above. Reaching such goals/targets will require access to very large amounts of capital (equity
and debt) as each module is projected to cost in excess of $50 million to construct and require mobilization of substantial personnel,
technical resources and management skills. The Company does not possess either the financial or personnel resources required internally
and will need to source such resources from outside itself.

‘HISTORY, BACKGROUND AND CURRENT ACTIVITIES’, see discussion in Notes to the Financial Statements (particularly Notes 1,
3, 5, and 9) included in this report and Item 1 in our annual report on Form 10-K.
COVID-19 PANDEMIC RELATED MATTERS:
The Company faces risks and uncertainties and factors
beyond our control that are magnified during the current Covid-19 pandemic and the unique economic, financial, governmental and health-related
conditions in which the Company, the country and the entire world now reside. To date the Company has experienced direct impacts in various
areas including but without limitation: i) government ordered shutdowns which have slowed the Company’s research and development
projects and other initiatives, ii) shifted focus of state and federal governments which is likely to negatively impact the Company’s
legislative initiatives in Pennsylvania and Washington D. C., iii) strains and uncertainties in both the equity and debt markets which
have made discussion and planning of funding of the Company and its initiatives and projects with investment bankers, banks and potential
strategic partners more tenuous, iv) strains and uncertainties in the agricultural sector and markets have made discussion and planning
more difficult as future industry conditions are now more difficult to assess and predict, v) constraints due to problems experienced
in the global industrial supply chain since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which have delayed certain research and development testing
and have delayed and/or increased the cost of construction of the Company’s initial 3G Tech installation as equipment/services remain
difficult to acquire in a timely manner, vi) due to the age and health of our core management team, many of whom are age 70 or older and
have had one or more existing health issues (including brief periods of Covid-19 infection), the Covid-19 pandemic places the Company
at greater risk than was previously the case (to a higher degree than would be the case if the Company had a larger, deeper and/or younger
core management team), and vii) there almost certainly will be other unanticipated consequences for the Company as a result of the current
pandemic emergency and its aftermath.
39
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition
The Company currently does not generate revenue
and if and when the Company begins to generate revenue the Company will comply with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
Stock-based compensation
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718,
which generally requires that share-based compensation transactions be accounted and recognized in the statement of income based upon
their grant date fair values.
Pursuant to ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”
(“Topic 815”), the Company reviews all financial instruments for the existence of features which may require fair value accounting
and a related mark-to-market adjustment at each reporting period end. Once determined, the Company assesses these instruments as derivative
liabilities. The fair value of these instruments is adjusted to reflect the fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase
or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives. As of December 31,
2022 and 2021, there are no derivative financial instruments.
Options:
The Company has issued options to employees and consultants
under its 2006 Plan to purchase common shares of the Company. Options are valued on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The expected volatility is based on the historical price volatility of the Company’s common stock. The dividend yield represents
the Company’s anticipated cash dividend on common stock over the expected term of the stock options. The U.S. Treasury bill rate
for the expected term of the stock options was utilized to determine the risk-free interest rate. The expected term of stock options represents
the period of time the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding based upon management’s estimates.
Warrants:
The Company has issued warrants to purchase common
shares of the Company. Warrants are valued using a fair value based method, whereby the fair value of the warrant is determined at the
warrant issue date using a market-based option valuation model based on factors including an evaluation of the Company’s value as
of the date of the issuance, consideration of the Company’s limited liquid resources and business prospects, the market price of
the Company’s stock in its mostly inactive public market and the historical valuations and purchases of the Company’s warrants.
When warrants are issued in combination with debt or equity securities, the warrants are valued and accounted for based on the relative
fair value of the warrants in relation to the total value assigned to the debt or equity securities and warrants combined.
Lease Accounting:
The Company accounts for leases under ASC 842,  Leases  (“ASC
842”). Accordingly, the Company will determine whether an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. If a
lease is determined to exist, the term of such lease is assessed based on the date on which the underlying asset is made available for
the Company’s use by the lessor. The Company’s assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancelable term of the lease,
inclusive of any rent-free periods and/or periods covered by early-termination options which the Company is reasonably certain of not
exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines
lease classification as either operating or finance at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation
reflected in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.
For leases with a term exceeding 12 months,
a lease liability is recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement reflecting the present value of
its fixed minimum payment obligations over the lease term. A corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset equal to the initial
lease liability is also recorded, adjusted for any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the
lease and reduced by any lease incentives received. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a
given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement, as rates
implicit in its leasing arrangements are typically not readily determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate
it would pay to borrow on a secured basis and incorporates the term and economic environment of the associated lease.

decrease in consulting costs is due to the capitalization of costs related to the 3G project. Investor relations expenses were $422,000
and $175,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the increase is due to a new contract with an investor
relations firm and increased activity during the six months ended December 31, 2022 due to the resumption of investor conferences. Legal
costs were $32,000 and $146,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The six months ended December 31, 2021
incurred greater legal costs as a result of the hiring of a law firm to represent the Company in a lawsuit for the hack and attempt to
steal the Company’s domain, engaging a law firm on the dissolution of PA-1, legal work in relation to corporate structure matters
and preparation for the 2022 shareholder meeting and other matters.

expense relating to the change in fair value from the modification of option terms was nil for both the six months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company extended expiration dates of warrants
for certain consultants which resulted in the recognition of nil and $6,000 in non-cash compensation.
Depreciation
Total depreciation expense was $724 and $580 for
the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Legal expenses were $5,000 and $39,000 for the six
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The difference of $35,000 was due to greater costs incurred in 2021 related to
patent work and OMRI certification.
Loss from Operations
As a result of the factors described above, the
loss from operations was $1,541,000 and $1,226,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Other Expense
Other (income) expense was $108,000 and $(10,007,000)
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The company recognized a gain on the legal dissolution of PA-1 of $10,235,000
in 2021. Interest expense of $73,000 and $3,000 was recorded during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due
to the modification of expiring warrants held by investors in 2022 and 2021. Interest expense related to convertible notes was $95,000
and $92,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

2021, respectively, and the net (income) loss per basic common share was $.04 and $(.21) for both the six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's consolidated financial statements for
the six months ended December 31, 2022 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022 includes a "going concern"
explanatory paragraph which means that the auditors stated that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern.
Operating Activities
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of
approximately $1,101,000. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $1,922,000,
primarily consisting of cash operating expenses related to salaries and benefits, and other general and administrative costs such as
insurance, legal, accounting, consulting and investor relations expenses as well as the purchase of property and equipment. Cash
expenditures were offset by proceeds from financing activities, primarily the exercise of warrants.
As previously noted, the
Company is currently not generating significant revenue and accordingly has not generated cash flows from operations. The Company
does not anticipate generating sufficient revenues to offset operating and capital costs for a minimum of two to five years. While
there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in its efforts to develop and construct its Projects and market its
Systems, it is certain that the Company will require substantial funding from external sources. Given the unsettled state of the
current credit and capital markets for companies such as Bion, there is no assurance the Company will be able to raise the funds it
needs on reasonable terms.
43
Investing Activities
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company invested $739,000 in the purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to project construction in process.
Financing Activities
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company received gross cash proceeds of $56,125 from the exercise of 74,834 warrants into shares of the Company’s common stock.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company entered into subscription agreements to sell units for $1.00 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of the Company’s
restricted common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of the Company’s restricted common stock for $0.75 per share with
an expiry date of December 31, 2024, and pursuant thereto, the Company issued 546,000 units for total proceeds of $546,000.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has debt obligations
consisting of: a) deferred compensation of $714,000 and b) convertible notes payable – affiliates of $5,300,000.
Plan of Operations and Outlook
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of approximately
$1,101,000.
The Company continues to explore sources of additional
financing to satisfy its current operating requirements as it is not currently generating any significant revenues.
During fiscal
years 2022 and 2021, the Company has faced progressively less difficulty in raising equity funding (but substantial equity dilution has
resulted from the larger amounts of equity financing during the periods). Less funds were raised during the six months ended December
31, 2022 and the Company anticipates substantial increases in demands for capital and operating expenditures during the second half of
fiscal year 2023 (and periods thereafter) as it moves toward commercial implementation of its 3G Tech and development of JVs and, therefore,
is likely to continue to face, significant cash flow management challenges due to limited capital resources and working capital constraints
which have only recently begun to be alleviated.
As a result, the Company has faced, and continues to face, significant cash flow management
challenges due to material working capital constraints.
To partially mitigate these working capital constraints, the Company's core
senior management and some key employees and consultants have been deferring part of their cash compensation and/or are accepting
compensation in the form of securities of the Company (Notes 5 and 7 to Financial Statements) and members of the Company's senior management
have from time to time made loans to the Company. During the year ended June 30, 2018 senior management and certain core employees and
consultants agreed to a one-time extinguishment of liabilities owed by the Company which in aggregate totaled $2,404,000. As of June 30
2022, such deferrals/loans totaled approximately $5,765,000 (including accrued interest and deferred compensation converted into convertible
obligations and convertible promissory notes but excluding conversions of deferred compensation into the Company's common stock by officers,
employees and consultants that have already been completed).
The extended constraints on available resources have had, and continue
to have, negative effects on the pace and scope of the Company's effort to develop its business . The Company made reductions in its
personnel during the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2015 and again in 2018. The constraint on available resources has had, and continues
to have, negative effects on the pace and scope of the Company’s efforts to develop its business. The Company has had to delay payment
of trade obligations and has had to economize in many ways that have potentially negative consequences. If the Company is able to continue
its recent increased success in its efforts to raise needed funds during the remainder of the current fiscal year (and subsequent periods),
of which there is no assurance, management will not need to consider deeper cuts (including additional personnel cuts) and curtailment
of ongoing activities including research and development activities.
The Company will need to obtain additional capital
to fund its operations and technology development, to satisfy existing creditors, to develop the Initial Project, JVs,
and CAFO Retrofit waste remediation systems (potentially including the Kreider 2 facility. The Company anticipates
that it will seek to raise from $20,000,000 to $80,000,000 or more (debt and equity) during the next twelve months.
However, as discussed
above, there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise sufficient funds or further capital for the operations planned in the near
future.
44
The Company is not currently generating any significant
revenues. Further, the Company’s anticipated revenues, if any, from existing projects, JVs and proposed projects will not be sufficient
to meet the Company’s anticipated operational and capital expenditure needs for many years.
During the six months ended December
31, 2022 the Company raised gross proceeds of approximately $602,000 through the sale of its securities. During the year ended June 30,
2021 the Company raised gross proceeds of approximately $5,209,000 through the sale of its securities and paid commissions of approximately
$165,000, and anticipates raising additional funds from such sales and transactions. During the year ended June 30, 2022 the Company raised
gross proceeds for approximately $1,737,000 and paid commissions of approximately $18,600.
However, there is no guarantee that we will
be able to raise sufficient funds or further capital for the operations planned in the near future.
Because the Company is not currently generating
significant revenues, the Company will need to obtain additional capital to fund its operations and technology development, to satisfy
existing creditors, to develop the Initial Project and subsequent Projects.
As indicated above, the Company anticipates that it
will seek to raise from $20,000,000 to $80,000,000 or more (from debt, equity, joint venture, strategic partnering, etc.) during the next
twelve months, some of which may be in the context of joint ventures for the development of one or more large scale projects.
We reiterate
that there is no assurance, especially in the extremely unsettled capital markets that presently exist for companies such as Bion, that
the Company will be able to obtain the funds that it needs to stay in business, finance its Projects and other activities, continue its
technology development and/or to successfully develop its business.
See Item 2 below and Note 5 (“Pennvest Loan and Bion PA1 LLC
(“PA1”) Dissolution”) to the Financial Statements included in this report
and the Company’s Forms 10-K for
the year ended June 30, 2022 (and the years 2009-2021) for discussion and more details related to the dissolution of PA1, the Pennvest
Loan and the
Kreider 1 project.
As indicated above, the Company anticipates that
it will seek to raise from $20,000,000 to $80,000,000 or more (from debt, equity, joint venture, strategic partnering, etc.) during the
next twelve months, some of which may be in the context of joint ventures for the development of one or more large scale projects.
We
reiterate that there is no assurance, especially in the extremely unsettled capital markets that presently exist for companies such as
Bion, that the Company will be able to obtain the funds that it needs to stay in business, finance its Projects, JVs and other activities,
continue its technology development and/or to successfully develop its business.
There is extremely limited likelihood that funds
required during the next twelve months or in the periods immediately thereafter will be generated from operations and there is no assurance
that those funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional
capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations and/or to raise capital from external sources would force the
Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Further, there
can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significantly
dilutive effect on the Company's existing shareholders. All of these factors have been exacerbated by the extremely limited and unsettled
credit and capital markets presently existing for companies such as Bion.
Covid-19 pandemic related matters:
The Company faces risks and uncertainties and factors
beyond our control that are magnified during the current Covid-19 pandemic and the unique economic, financial, governmental and health-related
conditions in which the Company, the country and the entire world now reside. To date the Company has experienced direct impacts in various
areas including but without limitation: i) government ordered shutdowns which have slowed the Company’s research and development
projects and other initiatives, ii) shifted focus of state and federal governments which is likely to negatively impact the Company’s
legislative initiatives in Pennsylvania and Washington D. C., iii) strains and uncertainties in both the equity and debt markets which
have made discussion and planning of funding of the Company and its initiatives and projects with investment bankers, banks and potential
strategic partners more tenuous, iv) strains and uncertainties in the agricultural sector and markets have made discussion and planning
more difficult as future industry conditions are now more difficult to assess and predict, v) constraints due to problems experienced
in the global industrial supply chain since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which have delayed certain research and development testing
and have delayed and/or increased the cost of construction of the Company’s initial 3G Tech installation as equipment/services remain
difficult to acquire in a timely manner, vi) due to the age and health of our core management team, many of whom are age 70 or older and
have had one or more existing health issues (including brief periods of Covid-19 infection), the Covid-19 pandemic places the Company
at greater risk than was previously the case (to a higher degree than would be the case if the Company had a larger, deeper and/or younger
core management team), and vii) there almost certainly will be other unanticipated consequences for the Company as a result of the current
pandemic emergency and its aftermath.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
We have the following material contractual obligations
(in addition to employment and consulting agreements with management and employees):
The Company entered into an agreement on September
23, 2021, to lease approximately four acres of land near Fair Oaks, Indiana, for the development site of its Initial Project.
The future minimum lease payment under noncancelable operating lease with
terms greater than one year as of December 31, 2022:
From October to December 2022

Less imputed interest
(14,557 )
Total
$ 135,443
The weighted average remaining lease term and discounted rate related to
the Company’s lease liability as of December 31, 2022 were 2.08 years and 10%, respectively. The Company’s lease discount
rate is generally based on the estimates of its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s lease
cannot be readily determined.
Through 3G1 the Company is in the process of developing
the Initial Project. See discussion above and in the Notes to our Financial Statements.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term
is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition,
revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). This term refers to the controls
and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods. Our Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, and has concluded that, as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at ensuring that required information will be disclosed on a timely basis in our reports filed under the Exchange Act,
as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting discussed in Item 9(A) of our Form 10-K for the year
ended June 30, 2022.
(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
The Company is currently involved in no litigation matters except:
A: Website:
Domain Sale/Resolved Litigation/Hacking/Theft
On March 23, 2022
the Company entered into an agreement to sell domain name <biontech.com> and other related assets to BioNTech SE (“BNTX”)
for the sum of $950,000 (before expenses related to the transaction) which sale was closed/completed on April 2, 2022 with a one-time
gain of $902,490. The Company has been using www.bionenviro.com as its primary website (and domain) since July 2021 due to the
events described below. The Company has not been using biontech.com as its primary website since July 2021 so domain name <biontech.com>
no longer represented a core asset of the Company.
As previously reported, on
Saturday morning, July 17, 2021, our historical website domain – biontech.com – and email services were compromised
and disabled. Research indicated that an unknown party had ‘hijacked’ the domain in a theft attempt. On September 10, 2021,
the Company filed a federal lawsuit ‘in rem’ to recover the <biontech.com> domain and the unknown ‘John Doe’
who hacked and attempted to steal the website. The litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia, Alexandria Division under the heading ‘Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc., Plaintiff, vs John Doe and <biontech.com>,
Defendants’ (Case No. 1:21-cv-01034), seeking recovery of the domain name and other relief as set forth therein.
On November 19, 2021, the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division issued an order stating that “… ORDERED,
ADJUDGED and Decreed that plaintiff Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc. (‘plaintiff) Is the lawful owner of domain name <biontech.com>
….” under the heading ‘Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc., Plaintiff, vs John Doe and <biontech.com>, Defendants’
(Case No. 1:21-cv-01034). The Company has moved the domain name <biontech.com> to a new registrar and reactivated it for the Company’s
use (paired currently with its current bionenviro.com website).
No shareholder, sensitive
or confidential information was available to be breached which has limited damages from the hack/theft to date. However, the Company’s
email operations were subject to short term disruption and expenses were incurred related to the matter including legal fees.
The Company created ‘work-arounds’
as a result. These issues have been resolved and the Company has moved our website (and email) to a new domain: bionenviro.com. Website
access is now www.bionenviro.com. To send emails to Bion personnel, one uses the same name identifier previously used, but in the
address, substitute ‘bionenviro.com’ for “biontech.com’: For example cscott@biontech.com (no longer functional)
is cscott@bionenviro.com and mas@biontech.com (no longer functional) is now mas@bionenviro.com.
47
B: Dissolution of Bion PA1, LLC (“PA1”)
PA1, the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary, was dissolved on December 29, 2021 on which date it owed approximately $10,010,000 under the terms of the Pennvest
Loan related to the construction of the Kreider 1 System including accrued interest and late charges totaling $2,255,802 as of that date.
Through the date of the dissolution, PA1 was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and its assets and liabilities were included on
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2021, PA1’s total assets were $297 and its total liabilities were
$10,154,334 (including the Pennvest Loan in the aggregate amount of $9,939,148, accounts payable of $214,235 and accrued liabilities of
$950) which sums were included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2021. Subsequent to the dissolution of PA1, its assets and liabilities are no longer consolidated and included in the Company’s
balance sheet. As of December 29, 2021, PA1’s total assets were nil and its total liabilities were $10,234,501 (including the Pennvest
Loan in the aggregate amount of $10,009,802, accounts payable of $212,263 and accrued liabilities of $12,436). The net amount of $10,234,501
was recognized as a gain on the legal dissolution of a subsidiary in other (income) expense.
As background, the terms
of the Pennvest Loan provided for funding of up to $7,754,000 which was to be repaid by interest-only payments for three years, followed
by an additional ten-year amortization of principal. The Pennvest Loan accrued interest at 2.547% per annum for years 1 through 5 and
3.184% per annum for years 6 through maturity. The Pennvest Loan required minimum annual principal payments of approximately $5,886,000
in fiscal years 2013 through 2021, and $846,000 in fiscal year 2022, $873,000 in fiscal year 2023 and $149,000 in fiscal year 2024. The
Pennvest Loan was collateralized by PA1’s Kreider 1 System and by a pledge of all revenues generated from Kreider 1 including, but
not limited to, revenues generated from nutrient reduction credit sales and by-product sales. In addition, in consideration for the excess
credit risk associated with the project, Pennvest was entitled to participate in the profits from Kreider 1 calculated on a net cash flow
basis, as defined. The Company has incurred interest expense related to the Pennvest Loan of $123,444 and $246,887 for the years ended
June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the limited development of the depth and breadth of the Pennsylvania nutrient reduction
credit market, PA1 commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring the obligations under
the Pennvest Loan during 2013. In the context of such negotiations, PA1 elected not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest
Loan since January 2013. Additionally, the PA1 did not make any principal payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and, therefore,
the Company classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability through the dissolution of PA1 on December 29, 2021.
During August 2012, the Company
provided Pennvest (and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 system met the ‘technology guaranty’ standards
which were incorporated in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan has been solely an obligation of PA1 since
that date. Note, however, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 reflects the Pennvest Loan as a liability
of $9,868,495 despite the fact that the obligation (if any) was solely an obligation of PA1 .
On September 25, 2014, the
Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (“Pennvest”) exercised its right to declare the PA1’s Pennvest Loan
in default, accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal, interest plus late charges) on or before October
24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and did/does not have the resources to make the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 commenced discussions
and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest rejected PA1’s proposal made during the fall of 2014. PA1 made
a final proposal to Pennvest during September 2021 which proposal was also rejected by Pennvest. PA1 provided Pennvest with its financial
statements (which include a description of system status) annually. During the 2021 fiscal year, Pennvest’s auditors requested a
‘corrective action plan’ and PA1 informed Pennvest that “… there is no viable corrective action plan for the
Pennvest Loan (‘Loan’). The facility funded by the Loan has been shut down for many years (which has been disclosed in the
annual financial reports to Pennvest and in public filings by the parent of Bion PA 1, LLC) and the technology utilized in the facility
is now obsolete. The facility has not been commercially operated for approximately six years and has generated zero income. We recommend
that Pennvest take appropriate steps to remove and sell the equipment.” Pennvest responded favorably to the approach of selling
the equipment.
On December 29, 2021, the
Company approved and executed a ‘Consent of the Sole Member of Bion PA 1’ (the “Consent to Dissolution”) that
authorized the complete liquidation and dissolution of PA1. A Statement of Dissolution was filed by PA1 with the Colorado Secretary of
State on December 29, 2021.The liquidation value of Bion PA 1’s property is substantially below the current amount outstanding under
the Funding Agreement dated October 27, 2010 by and between PA1 and Pennvest, the only known secured creditor of PA1. Post-dissolution,
PA1’s activities will be limited entirely to activities required to properly distribute its net assets to creditors and wind down
its business.
48
PA1 and Pennvest agreed to
have the equipment sold by a third party auctioneer who  arranged for the sale of its property and delivery of all proceeds (net
of commissions and customary costs of sale) to Pennvest. The auction took place during the period of May 13-18, 2022. The Company’s
personnel assisted PA1 with this process as needed at no cost to PA1. The net sum of $104,725 was realized from the asset sale, which
sum was delivered to Pennvest on June 15, 2022. Pursuant to agreement with Pennvest and Kreider Farms, the remaining unsold assets have
been transferred to Kreider Farms in order to complete the winding up of the Kreider 1 project.
Upon the complete distribution
of all assets of PA1, whether by transfer or sale and distribution of net proceeds as provided above, PA1 will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the cessation of all activities. No distributions of PA1’s assets will be made to the Company or its affiliates.
The Consent to Dissolution authorized Mark A. Smith, the Company’s President and the sole manager of PA1, to cause to be delivered
for filing the Statement of Dissolution, to give notice of the dissolution, and to take any other act necessary to wind up and liquidate
the business.
PA1 has made no payments
to vendors or other creditors in connection with the dissolution other than the payment to Pennvest described above. No distributions
or payments of any kind have ever been made to the Company, the sole member of PA1, since inception and no payment will be made to the
Company or any affiliate in connection with the dissolution.

of the Pennvest Loan and PA1, please review our Form’s 10-K for the years from 2008 through 2021 including the Notes to the Financial
Statements included therein.
