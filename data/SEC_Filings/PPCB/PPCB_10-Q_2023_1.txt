NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
Nature
of Operations
Propanc
Biopharma, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was originally incorporated in Melbourne,
Victoria Australia on October 15, 2007 as Propanc PTY LTD, and continues to be based in Camberwell, Victoria Australia. Since its inception,
substantially all of the operations of the Company have been focused on the development of new cancer treatments targeting high-risk
patients, particularly cancer survivors, who need a follow-up, non-toxic, long-term therapy designed to prevent the cancer from returning
and spreading. The Company anticipates establishing global markets for its technologies. Our lead product candidate, which we refer to
as PRP, is an enhanced pro-enzyme formulation designed to enhance the anti-cancer effects of multiple enzymes acting synergistically.
It is currently in the preclinical phase of development.
On
November 23, 2010, the Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware as Propanc Health Group Corporation. In January 2011, to reorganize
the Company, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Propanc PTY LTD on a one-for-one basis making it a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company.
On
July 22, 2016, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Propanc (UK) Limited under the laws of England and Wales for the purpose
of submitting an orphan drug application to the European Medicines Agency as a small and medium-sized enterprise. As of December 31,
2022, there has been no activity within this entity.
Effective
April 20, 2017, the Company changed its name to “Propanc Biopharma, Inc.” to reflect the Company’s stage of operations
and development better.
In
July 2020, a world-first patent was granted in Australia for the cancer treatment method patent family. Presently, there are 43 granted,
allowed, or accepted patents and 22 patents filed, or under examination in key global jurisdictions relating to the use of proenzymes
against solid tumors, covering the lead product candidate PRP.
The
Company hopes to capture and protect additional patentable subject matter based on the Company’s field of technology relating to
pharmaceutical compositions of proenzymes for treating cancer by filing additional patent applications as it advances its lead product
candidate, PRP, through various stages of development.
On
May 18, 2022, the board of directors of the Company approved and authorized, and the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Company’s
voting capital stock approved by written consent, in accordance with Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, for the Company
to file a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation (the “May Certificate”) with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, which increased the Company’s authorized capital stock. The May Certificate increased the number of authorized
shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $ 0.001
per share, from
1,000,000,000
to
3,000,000,000 . The number of authorized
shares of preferred stock remains at
1,500,005 , such that the total number of shares of all classes and series the Company was authorized
to issue became
3,001,500,005
shares. The Certificate was filed and became effective on July 6, 2022.
On
September 21, 2022, the board of directors of the Company approved and authorized, and the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Company’s
voting capital stock approved by written consent, in accordance with Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, for the Company
to file a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation (the “September Certificate”) with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, which increased the Company’s authorized capital stock. The September Certificate increased the
number of authorized shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $ 0.001
per share, from
3,000,000,000
to
10,000,000,000 . The
number of authorized shares of preferred stock remains at
1,500,005 , such that the total number of shares of all classes and series the
Company is authorized to issue is
10,001,500,005
shares. The Certificate was filed and became effective on November 4, 2022.
Basis
of Presentation
The
Company’s interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly
Report”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In the
opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications and non-recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly our consolidated results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021 and cash flows for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and our consolidated financial position at December
31, 2022 have been made. The Company’s results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
Certain
information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the Company’s annual audited consolidated financial statements have
been condensed or omitted from the Company’s interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report. Accordingly, these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The June 30, 2022 balance sheet
is derived from those statements.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Propanc Biopharma, Inc., the parent entity, and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Propanc PTY LTD. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Propanc (UK) Limited was
an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary through December 31, 2022.

December

(Unaudited)
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the estimates of useful lives for depreciation, valuation of the operating lease liability and related right-of-use
asset, valuation of derivatives, allowance for uncollectable receivables, valuation of equity based instruments issued for other than
cash, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and foreign currency translation due to certain average exchange rates applied in
lieu of spot rates on transaction dates.
Foreign
Currency Translation and Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
The
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary’s functional currency is the Australian dollar (AUD). For financial reporting purposes,
the Australian dollar has been translated into the Company’s reporting currency which is the United States dollar ($) and/or (USD).
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated
at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. Equity transactions are translated at each historical transaction
date spot rate. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component
of stockholders’ equity (deficit) as “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Gains and losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a component of other comprehensive
income (loss). There have been no significant fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of Australian dollars to USD after
the balance sheet date.
Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented includes only foreign currency translation gains (losses).
Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the
consolidated balance sheet date with any transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated
in a currency other than the functional currency included in the consolidated results of operations as incurred. Effective fiscal year
2021, the parent company determined that the intercompany loans will not be repaid in the foreseeable future and thus, per ASC 830-20-35-3,
gains and losses from measuring the intercompany balances are recorded within cumulative translation adjustment, a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss). Prior to July 1, 2020, the Company recorded the foreign currency transaction gains and losses from
measuring the intercompany balances as a component of other income (expenses) titled foreign currency transaction gain (loss). As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized a cumulative exchange gain (loss) of approximately $ 269,000
and $ 485,000 , respectively,
on intercompany loans made by the parent to the subsidiary that have not been repaid as of December 31, 2022, which is included as component
of accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.
As
of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the exchange rates used to translate amounts in Australian dollars into USD for the purposes
of preparing the consolidated financial statements were as follows:

Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with US GAAP. For certain financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short
maturities. Amounts recorded for notes payable, net of discount, and loans payable also approximate fair value because current interest
rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities are substantially the same.
The
Company follows accounting guidance for financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring
fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related
to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income
approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement
cost).

The
guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad
levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:
Level
1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2: Inputs, other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level
3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us,
which reflect those that a market participant would use.
Also
see Note 11 – Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and at banks, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less with financial
institutions, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are reflected as a current liability on the balance sheets. There were
no
cash equivalents
as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred;
additions, renewals, and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of
property and equipment is provided using the declining balance method. The depreciable amount is the cost less its residual value.
The
estimated useful lives are as follows:
SCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVE
Machinery
and equipment
-
5
years
Furniture
-
7

Patents
Patents
are stated at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods if and once the patent has been granted by
a regulatory agency. However, the Company will expense any patent costs as long as we are in the startup stage. Accordingly, as the Company’s
products are not currently approved for market, all patent costs incurred from 2013 through December 31, 2022 were expensed immediately.
This practice of expensing patent costs immediately ends when a product receives market authorization from a government regulatory agency.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
In
accordance with ASC 360-10, “Long-lived assets,” which include property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future
cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily
determinable.
Employee
Benefit Liability
Liabilities
arising in respect of wages and salaries, accumulated annual leave, accumulated long service leave and any other employee benefits expected
to be settled within twelve months of the reporting date are measured based on the employee’s remuneration rates applicable at
the reporting date. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflow to
be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. All employee liabilities are owed within the next twelve
months.
Australian
Goods and Services Tax (“GST”)
Revenues,
expenses and balance sheet items are recognized net of the amount of GST, except payable and receivable balances which are shown inclusive
of GST. The GST incurred is payable on revenues to, and recoverable on purchases from, the Australian Taxation Office.
Cash
flows are presented in the statements of cash flow on a gross basis, except for the GST component of investing and financing activities,
which are disclosed as operating cash flows.
As
of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the Company was owed $ 4,543
and $ 2,342 , respectively, from the Australian Taxation Office. These
amounts were fully collected subsequent to the balance sheet reporting dates.

Derivative
Instruments
ASC
Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging
(“ASC Topic 815”), establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings. On the date of conversion or payoff
of debt, the Company records the fair value of the conversion shares, removes the fair value of the related derivative liability, removes
any discounts and records a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment. On July 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASU 2017-11 under which down-round
Features in Financial Instruments will no longer cause derivative treatment.
Convertible
Notes With Variable Conversion Options
The
Company has entered into convertible notes, some of which contain variable conversion options, whereby the outstanding principal and
accrued interest may be converted, by the holder, into common shares at a fixed discount to the price of the common stock at or around
the time of conversion. The Company treats these convertible notes as stock settled debt under ASC 480, “ Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity ” and measures the fair value of the notes at the time of issuance, which is the result of the share price discount
at the time of conversion and records the put premium as interest expense.
Income
Taxes
The
Company is governed by Australia and United States income tax laws, which are administered by the Australian Taxation Office and the
United States Internal Revenue Service, respectively. The Company follows ASC 740 “ Accounting for Income Taxes ,” when
accounting for income taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets
and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or
minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The
Company follows ASC 740, Sections 25 through 60, “ Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes .” These sections provide
detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial
statements. Tax positions must meet a “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized
upon the adoption of ASC 740 and in subsequent periods.
Research
and Development Costs and Tax Credits
In
accordance with ASC 730-10,
“Research and Development-Overall,”
research and development costs are expensed when incurred.
Total research and development costs for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 74,878
and $ 50,753 , respectively. Total
research and development costs for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 176,203
and $ 97,307 , respectively. Research
and development costs include allocations of salary among certain officers.
The
Company may apply for research and development tax concessions with the Australian Taxation Office on an annual basis. Although the amount
is possible to estimate at year end, the Australian Taxation Office may reject or materially alter the claim amount. Accordingly, the
Company does not recognize the benefit of the claim amount until cash receipt since collectability is not certain until such time. The
tax concession is a refundable credit. If the Company has net income, then the Company can receive the credit which reduces its income
tax liability. If the Company has net losses, then the Company may still receive a cash payment for the credit, however, the Company’s
net operating loss carryforwards are reduced by the gross equivalent loss that would produce the credit amount when the income tax rate
is applied to that gross amount. The concession is recognized as tax benefit, in operations, upon receipt.
During
each of the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company applied for, and received from the Australian Taxation Office, a
research and development tax credit in the amount of $ 129,321
and $ 55,463 , respectively, which is reflected as a tax benefit in the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Stock
Based Compensation
The
Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “ Stock Compensation ”. ASC 718 requires the fair
value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the shorter of the service period
or the vesting period. The Company values employee and non-employee stock-based compensation at fair value using the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing Model.
The
Company adopted ASU 2018-07 and accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria
of ASC 718 and recognizes the fair value of such awards over the service period. The Company used the modified prospective method of
adoption.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company applies ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 establishes a single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue
recognition guidance. This standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also
requires certain additional disclosures. Subject to these criteria, the Company intends to recognize revenue relating to royalties on
product sales in the period in which the sale occurs and the royalty term has begun.

Legal
Expenses
All
legal costs for litigation are charged to expense as incurred.
Leases
The
Company follows ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842) and applies the package of practical expedients, which permit it not to reassess under
the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. In addition, the Company
elected not to apply ASC Topic 842 to arrangements with lease terms of 12 months or less. Operating lease right of use assets (“ROU”)
represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value
of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company
uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future
payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general
and administrative expenses.
Reclassifications
Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassified amounts have no impact
on the Company’s previously reported financial position or results of operations and relate to the presentation of accrued
interest separately on the consolidated balance sheet of which $ 57,822
was previously included in convertible notes, net of
discounts and including premiums at June 30, 2022.
Basic
and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share
Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of the incremental
common shares issuable upon exercise of common stock equivalents such as stock options, warrants and convertible debt instruments. Potentially
dilutive securities are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. As a result, the basic and diluted per-share
amounts for all periods presented are identical.
Each holder of the notes has agreed to a
4.99 %
beneficial ownership conversion limitation
(subject to certain noteholders’ abilities to increase such limitation to 9.99% upon 60 days’ notice to the Company), and
each note may not be converted during the first six-month period from the date of issuance.
The
Company’s CEO holds Series A Preferred Stock and B Preferred Stock that, when combined, confers upon him a majority vote regarding
authorization of additional common shares and/or the authorization of a reverse split the stock as considered necessary.
Such
securities are considered dilutive securities, which were excluded from the computation since the effect is anti-dilutive.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
We
have reviewed the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods.
We have carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and do not believe that
any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial position or operations in the near
term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of the Company’s financial management.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options
(Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which eliminates the beneficial
conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments, amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity’s
own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions, and modifies how particular convertible
instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS calculation. The standard is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 for smaller reporting companies, and interim periods within those reporting periods.
Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those
reporting periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had no revenues, had a net loss of $ 1,102,713 ,
and had net cash used in operations of $ 734,542 . Additionally, As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit, stockholders’
deficit and accumulated deficit of $ 2,938,328 , $ 2,915,417 , and $ 63,069,163 , respectively. It is management’s opinion that these
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months
from the issue date of this Quarterly Report.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Successful
completion of the Company’s development program and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent upon future
events, including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its development activities, acceptance of the Company’s patent applications,
obtaining additional sources of suitable and adequate financing and ultimately achieving a level of sales adequate to support the Company’s
cost structure and business plan. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on its ability to further
develop and execute on its business plan. However, there can be no assurances that any or all of these endeavors will be successful.
In
March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a pandemic by the World
Health Organization, and the outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, Europe and Australia, including in each
of the areas in which the Company operates. The COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak has had a notable impact on general economic conditions,
including but not limited to the temporary closures of many businesses, “shelter-in-place” and other governmental regulations,
reduced business and consumer spending due to both job losses, reduced investing activity and M&A transactions, among many other
effects attributable to the COVID-19 (coronavirus), and there continue to be many unknowns. While to date the Company has not been required
to stop operating, management is evaluating its use of its office space, virtual meetings and the like. The Company continues to monitor
the impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak closely. The extent to which the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak will impact the Company’s
operations, ability to obtain financing or future financial results is uncertain.

Coventry
Enterprises, LLC Securities Purchase Agreement
On
November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Coventry Enterprises, LLC (“Coventry”), pursuant
to which Coventry purchased a promissory note from the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $ 125,000 , such principal and the
interest thereon convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock following an event of default. The Coventry note contains
a $ 25,000
original issue discount. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of $ 100,000
from the Coventry note for general working
capital purposes.
The
Coventry note bears interest at a rate of
10 % per annum, a $ 12,500
guaranteed interest. The principal amount and the guaranteed interest
is due and payable in seven equal monthly payments (each, a “Monthly Payment”) of $ 19,643 , commencing on March 24, 2023 and
continuing on the 24th day of each month thereafter (each, a “Monthly Payment Date”) until paid in full not later than October
24, 2023 (the “Maturity Date”), or such earlier date as the Coventry note is required or permitted to be repaid and to pay
such other interest to Coventry on the aggregate unconverted and then-outstanding principal amount of the Coventry note in accordance
with the provisions thereof. Any or all of the principal amount and guaranteed interest may be pre-paid at any time and from time to
time, in each case without penalty or premium.
Additionally,
in the event that, while the Coventry note has been outstanding for four months, there is a qualified Offering Statement on Form 1-A,
then Coventry may choose to convert any amount up to the entire balance of the Coventry Note, including guaranteed interest into shares
at the 1-A offering price.
At
any time following an event of default under 7(a)(i) of the Coventry Note, it becomes convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of
Common Stock at the option of Coventry, at any time and from time to time thereafter (subject to the beneficial ownership limitations
set forth in Section 5d thereof). The conversion price of the Coventry note is ninety percent (90%) per share of the lowest per-share
VWAP during the twenty (20) trading-day period before the conversion (each, a “Calculated Conversion Price”). In the event
that, within 30 calendar days either before or after any conversion, the conversion price of which is based upon a Calculated Conversion
Price, the Company consummates (in whole or in part) any financing (whether such financing is equity, equity-equivalent, or debt or any
combination thereof ) or for any other reason issues any shares of its Common Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents at a price less than
the most recent Calculated Conversion Price (the “Alternative Conversion Price”), regardless of when that note or instrument
was originated, then, in respect of such conversion and at the option of Coventry, (i) if the conversion shall not then have yet occurred,
then the Alternative Conversion Price shall be substituted for the Calculated Conversion Price and (ii) if the conversion shall already
have occurred, then, within two Trading Days following the written request from Coventry therefor, the Company shall issue to Coventry
that number of shares of Common Stock equivalent to the difference between the number of shares of Common Stock that had been issued
using the Calculated Conversion Price and the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued using the Alternative Conversion
Price.
Upon
the occurrence and during the continuation of certain events of default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate that shall
be equal to the lesser of i) 18% per annum or ii) the maximum rate permitted by law. Subject to the beneficial ownership limitation as
set forth in Section 5(d) of the Coventry note, if any event of default occurs, then the outstanding principal amount of the note, the
outstanding guaranteed interest amount of the note, plus accrued but unpaid default rate interest, liquidated damages and other amounts
owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become, at Coventry’s election, immediately due and payable at
its option, in cash or in shares of Common Stock, at the mandatory default amount, which amount is equal to 120% of the outstanding principal
amount of the note and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in addition to the payment of all other amounts, costs, expenses, and liquidated
damages due in respect of the note. In the event that the Company fails to deliver to Coventry shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of principal or interest, the Company shall pay in cash an amount that is equivalent to the amount in excess of the sales value of the
shares of Common Stock that Coventry would have been entitled to receive from the conversion over the principal amount and interest of
the attempted conversion.
As
an additional inducement to Coventry purchasing the Coventry note, the Company, as of the Original Issue Date and for no additional consideration,
issued to Coventry
75,000,000
shares of the Company’s Common Stock, which was valued using the relative fair value method at $ 37,500
and recognized as debt discount to be amortized over the term of the note.

On
August 10, 2017, the Company entered into a consulting agreement, retroactive to May 16, 2017, with a certain consultant, pursuant to
which the consultant agreed to provide certain consulting and business advisory services in exchange for a $ 310,000
junior subordinated
convertible note. The maturity date of the August 10, 2017 convertible note was
August 10, 2019
and was past due (see Note 8). The note
accrued interest at a rate of
10 % per annum and was convertible into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the lesser of $ 750
or
65 % of the three lowest trades in the
ten
trading days prior to the conversion. The August 10, 2017 convertible note was fully earned
upon signing the consulting agreement and matured on
August 10, 2019 . The Company accrued $ 155,000
related to this expense at June 30,
2017 and recorded the remaining $ 155,000
related to this expense in fiscal year 2018. Upon an event of default, principal and accrued
interest immediately became due and payable under the note. Additionally, upon an event of default, at the election of the holder, the
note would accrue interest at a default interest rate of
18 % per annum or the highest rate of interest permitted by law. The consulting
agreement had a three-month term and expired on August 16, 2017. An aggregate total of $ 578,212
of the August 10, 2017 convertible note
was bifurcated with the embedded conversion option recorded as a derivative liability at fair value. During the year ended June 30, 2018,
the consultant converted $ 140,000
of principal and $ 10,764
of interest. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the consultant converted
an additional $ 161,000
of principal and $ 19,418

The
conversion price for the October 3, 2019 Crown Bridge Note was equal to 60% (representing a 40% discount) of the lowest closing bid price
(“Lowest Trading Price”) of the Common Stock for the ten trading days immediately prior to the delivery of a Notice of Conversion,
including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion was received . Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crown Bridge was restricted from effecting
a conversion if such conversion, along with other shares of the Company’s common stock beneficially owned by Crown Bridge and its
affiliates, exceeds
4.99 % of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock which may be increased up to
9.99 % upon 60 days
prior written notice by the Crown Bridge to the Company. The note was treated as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and accordingly the
Company recorded a $ 72,000
put premium.
The
October 3, 2019 Crown Bridge Note contained certain events of default, upon which principal and accrued interest would become immediately
due and payable. In addition, upon an event of default, interest on the outstanding principal accrued at a default interest rate of
15 %
per annum, or if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the highest rate of interest permitted by law. Further,
certain events of default may trigger penalty and liquidated damage provisions.
The
total principal amount outstanding under the October 3, 2019 Crown Bridge Note was $ 65,280
and accrued interest of $ 7,232
as of as of
June 30, 2020 following conversion of $ 42,720
of the principal balance during the year ended June 30, 2020. Accordingly, $ 28,480
of the
put premium was released in respect of the October 3, 2019 Crown Bridge Note during the year ended June 30, 2020 following partial conversion
of the principal balance.
There
were
15,000
unissued shares of Common Stock that were considered issuable for accounting purposes during the 1 st
quarter of
fiscal 2021 related to a conversion notice dated and received on September 16, 2020. In November 2020, the Company was notified by Crown
Bridge of the cancellation of this conversion notice as a result of the reverse stock split and, as such, the Company reversed the effects
of this transaction, thereby increasing the principal balance by $ 9,600
and put premium by $ 6,400
and a corresponding decrease in equity
of $ 16,000 .
The
total principal amount outstanding under the October 3, 2019 Crown Bridge Note was $ 65,280
and accrued interest of $ 25,930
as of June
30, 2022.
In
August 2022, the SEC filed a complaint against Crown Bridge due to its violation of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Crown Bridge agreed to surrender all conversion rights in its currently held convertible notes, including the Company’s note.
Consequently, as of December 31, 2022, the Company reclassified the remaining principal balance of $ 65,280
from convertible note into
a loan payable (see Note 5). Additionally, the Company recorded the remaining put premium of $ 43,520
into gain on extinguishment of debt
during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Therefore, the total principal amount outstanding under the above Crown Bridge financing
agreement was $ 0

Red
Road Holdings Securities Purchase Agreement
On
October 6, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Red Road Holdings
Corporation, a Virginia corporation (“Red Road”), pursuant to which Red Road purchased a convertible promissory note (the
“Note”) from the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $ 53,750 , such principal and the interest thereon convertible
into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the option of Red Road. The transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement closed
on October 12, 2022. The Company intends to use the net proceeds ($ 50,000 ) from the Note for general working capital purposes. The maturity
date of the Note is October 6, 2023 (the “Maturity Date”). The Note bears interest at a rate of
8 % per annum, which interest
may be paid by the Company to Red Road in shares of the Company’s Common Stock, but shall not be payable until the Note becomes
payable, whether at the Maturity Date or upon acceleration or by prepayment, as described below. In addition, upon an event of default,
interest on the outstanding principal shall accrue at a default interest rate of
22 % per annum, or if such rate is usurious or not permitted
by current law, then at the highest rate of interest permitted by law. Further, certain events of default may trigger penalty and liquidated
damage provisions. Red Road has the option to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of the Note, beginning on the date
which is one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of the Note and ending on the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the
date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined below), each in respect of the remaining outstanding amount of the Note, to convert
all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid amount of the Note into common stock at the then-applicable conversion price. Pursuant
to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid Red Road’s legal fees and due diligence expenses in the aggregate amount
of $ 3,750
which was recorded as a debt discount.
The
conversion price for the Note shall be equal to the Variable Conversion Price (as defined therein) (subject to equitable adjustments
for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Company relating to the Company’s securities or the securities of
any subsidiary of the Company, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events).
The
“Variable Conversion Price” shall mean 65% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined therein) (representing a discount rate
of 35%). “Market Price” means the average of the lowest three (3) Trading Prices (as defined below) for the Company’s
Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days prior to the conversion date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Red Road shall be restricted
from effecting a conversion if such conversion, along with other shares of the Company’s Common Stock beneficially owned by Red
Road and its affiliates, exceeds
4.99 % of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Note is treated as stock settled
debt under ASC 480 and accordingly the Company recorded a total of $ 28,942
put premium .
The
Note may be prepaid until 180 days from the Issuance date. If the Note is prepaid within 60 days of the issuance date, then the prepayment
premium shall be 110% of the face amount plus any accrued interest, if prepaid after 60 days from the issuance date, but less than 91
days from the issuance date, then the prepayment premium shall be 115% of the face amount plus any accrued interest, if prepaid after
90 days from the issuance date, but less than 121 days from the issuance date, then the prepayment premium shall be 120% of the face
amount plus any accrued interest, if prepaid after 120 days from the issuance date, but less than 151 days from the issuance date, then
the prepayment premium shall be 125% of the face amount plus any accrued interest, and if prepaid after 150 days from the issuance date,
but less than 181 days from the issuance date, then the prepayment premium shall be 129% of the face amount plus any accrued interest.
So long as the Note is outstanding, the Company covenants not to, without prior written consent from Red Road, sell, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets outside the ordinary course of business, which would render the Company a “shell
company” as such term is defined in Rule 144 .
In
the event that the Company fails to deliver to Red Road shares of the Company’s Common Stock issuable upon conversion of principal
or interest under the Note within three business days of a notice of conversion by Red Road, the Company shall incur a penalty of $ 1,000
per day;
provided ,
however , that such fee shall not be due if the failure to deliver the shares is a result of a third
party, such as the transfer agent. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of certain events of default, the Note will become
immediately due and payable and the Company will pay Red Road in full satisfaction of its obligations in the Note an amount equal to
150% of an amount equal to the then outstanding principal amount of the Note plus any interest accrued upon such event of default or
prior events of default.
The
total principal amount outstanding under the above Red Road Note was $ 53,750
and accrued interest of $ 1,013
as of December 31, 2022.

In
2016 and early 2017, the Company filed other patent applications. Three applications were filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (the
“PCT”). The PCT assists applicants in seeking patent protection by filing one international patent application under the
PCT, applicants can simultaneously seek protection for an invention in over 150 countries. Once filed, the application is placed under
the control of the national or regional patent offices, as applicable, in what is called the national phase. One of the PCT applications
filed in November 2016, entered national phase in July 2018 and another PCT application is currently entering national phase in August
2018. A third PCT application entered the national phase in October 2018.
In
July 2020, a world-first patent was granted in Australia for the cancer treatment method patent family. Presently, there are 43 granted,
allowed, or accepted patents and 22 patents filed, or under examination in key global jurisdictions relating to the use of proenzymes
against solid tumors, covering the lead product candidate PRP.
Further
patent applications are expected to be filed to capture and protect additional patentable subject matter based on the Company’s
field of technology relating to pharmaceutical compositions of proenzymes for treating cancer.
Foreign
Operations
As
of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company’s operations are based in Camberwell, Australia; however, the majority of research
and development is being conducted in the European Union.
On

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Derivative
Financial Instruments:
The
Company applies the provisions of ASC 815-40,
Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity , under which convertible instruments and
warrants, which contain terms that protect holders from declines in the stock price (reset provisions), may not be exempt from derivative
accounting treatment. As a result, warrants and embedded conversion options in convertible debt are recorded as a liability and are revalued
at fair value at each reporting date. If the fair value of the warrants exceeds the face value of the related debt, the excess is recorded
as change in fair value in operations on the issuance date. The Company had $ 164,500
(2 notes) and $ 79,000
(1 note) of convertible debt,
which were treated as derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
The
Company calculates the estimated fair values of the liabilities for derivative instruments using the Binomial Trees Method. The closing
price of the Company’s common stock at December 31, 2022, the last trading day of the period ended December 31, 2022, was $ 0.0006 .
The volatility, expected remaining term and risk-free interest rates used to estimate the fair value of derivative liabilities at December
31, 2022 are indicated in the table that follows. The expected term is equal to the remaining term of the warrants or convertible instruments
and the risk-free rate is based upon rates for treasury securities with the same term.

Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information
The
following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of Propanc Biopharma, Inc., and its wholly-owned
Australian subsidiary, Propanc PTY LTD (“Propanc” or the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and for the six months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes to those unaudited
financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. References in this Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to “us”, “we”, “our” and similar terms
refer to Propanc. This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the federal securities laws. The
events described in forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report may not occur. Generally, these statements relate to
business plans or strategies, projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of our plans or strategies, projected or anticipated
benefits from acquisitions to be made by us, or projections involving anticipated revenues, earnings or other aspects of our operating
results. The words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “project,”
“plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” and “continue,” and their opposites and similar expressions,
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or
events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are beyond our control, which may influence
the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based.
Our
actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.
Except as required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether from new information, future events or otherwise.
At
Propanc, our highest priority remains the safety, health and well-being of our employees, their families and our communities. The COVID-19
pandemic is a highly fluid situation and it is not currently possible for us to reasonably estimate the impact it may have on our financial
and operating results. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business as we learn more and the impact
of COVID-19 on our industry becomes clearer. We are complying health guidelines regarding safety procedures, including, but are not limited
to, social distancing, remote working, and teleconferencing. The extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business
is uncertain and difficult to predict. Adverse global economic and market conditions as a result of COVID-19 could also adversely affect
our business. If the pandemic continues to cause significant negative impacts to economic conditions, our results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity could be adversely impacted.
U.S.
Dollars are denoted herein by “USD,” “$” and “dollars”.
Overview
We
were incorporated in the state of Delaware as Propanc Health Group Corporation on November 23, 2010. In January 2011, to reorganize our
Company, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Propanc PTY LTD, an Australian corporation, on a one-for-one basis and Propanc
PTY LTD became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective April 20, 2017, we changed our name to “Propanc Biopharma, Inc.” to
better reflect our current stage of operations and development.
We
are a development-stage healthcare company that is currently focused on developing new cancer treatments for patients suffering from
pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancer. Utilizing our scientific and oncology consultants, we have developed a rational, composite
formulation of anti-cancer compounds, which together exert a number of effects designed to control or prevent tumors from recurring and
spreading through the body. Our lead product candidate, PRP, is a variation upon our novel formulation and involves pro-enzymes, the
inactive precursors of enzymes.
Recent
Developments
On
July 19, 2022, successful production of a synthetic recombinant version of the proenzyme trypsinogen was completed via the Proenzyme
Optimization Project 1 (POP1) joint research and drug discovery program. The program is designed to produce a backup clinical compound
to the Company’s lead product candidate, PRP, which is targeting metastatic cancer from solid tumors. On August 23, 2022, the initial
success of producing trypsinogen synthetically has now advanced to the stage where optimization of protein production is underway; whereas,
purification and yield of chymotrypsinogen is currently the focus of research.
On
August 3, 2022, a Joint Research Collaboration Agreement was established with the University of Jaén and the University of Granada,
Spain. Since late 2020, Mrs. Belén Toledo Cutillas MSc, has been investigating an important experimental thesis on the effects
of proenzyme therapy and the tumor microenvironment, which is the key to the development, invasion, metastatic spread and recurrence
of solid tumors. The work is being conducted at the laboratory of Professor Macarena Perán PhD, who is the lead researcher on
the project and is the second Joint Research and Collaboration Agreement currently in progress with the two Spanish Universities. On
September 8, 2022, proenzyme therapy was shown to have a favorable impact inhibiting, slowing, or reversing tumor development by acting
as an anti-tumor agent, decreasing tumor cell proliferation, developing a non-malignant phenotype (observable characteristics) and promoting
cell adhesion (sticking close to one another) and differentiation (cell specialization rather than stem cell like). It was concluded
that proenzyme therapy could have a significant impact on the tumor microenvironment as a potential clinical application.
On
August 16, 2022, a Notice of Allowance has been received from the European Patent Office (EPO) for claims involving compositions of proenzymes
to treat cancer. This is the second patent application allowed in this jurisdiction and expires in November 2036. A third patent application
is currently under examination at the EPO for a method to treat cancer stem cells, which was allowed in March this year by the US Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO). The field of the invention covers future dosing in planned clinical studies for the Company’s lead
product candidate, PRP.
On
November 9 and 10, 2022, Mr. James Nathanielsz, Propanc’s Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, conducted investor meetings and
presented at the Sidoti & Company’s upcoming Micro-Cap Virtual Investor Conference. The Sidoti & Company Micro-Cap Investor
Conference is a virtual event featuring micro-cap companies interacting with a number of institutional investors from across the United
States.

On
December 17, 2022, on behalf of the University of Jaén and the University of Granada, and Propanc Biopharma, Mrs. Belén
Toledo Cutillas MSc, Joint Researcher, presented at the recent 43 rd
Meeting of the European Organization of Research and Treatment
of Cancer (EORTC), Pharmacology and Molecular Mechanisms (PAMM) group. Mrs. Toledo Cutillas discussed novel approaches to hampering tumor
support of key components within the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, she described how “a protein-based treatment (PRP) re-educates”
certain tumor cells that play a key role in the tumor microenvironment, decreasing the tumor microenvironment influence on tumorigenesis
and increasing drug uptake of standard therapies that are often rendered ineffective due to chemoresistance.
Results
of Operations
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included elsewhere in this Report. The results discussed below are of the Company and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Propanc
PTY LTD.
For
the Three and Six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the Three and Six months ended December 31, 2021.
Revenue
For
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated no revenue because we are currently undertaking research and
development activities for market approval and no sales were generated in this period.
Administration
Expense
Administration
expense increased to $525,620 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $346,164 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021. This increase of approximately $179,000 is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $145,000 in
employee remuneration expense, increase in stock-based expenses of approximately $31,000, increase in accounting fees of
approximately $5,000 offset by a decrease in general consulting, legal and investor relation fees of approximately
$2,000.
Administration
expense increased to $990,752 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $777,904 for the six months ended December 31,
2021. This increase of approximately $213,000 is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $151,000 in general consulting,
legal and investor relation fees, increase in accounting fees of approximately $9,000, increase of approximately $164,000 in employee
remuneration expense, increase in marketing expenses of $7,000, offset by decrease in stock-based expenses of approximately $116,000
and decrease in other general and administrative expenses of approximately $2,000.
Occupancy
Expense
Occupancy
expenses increased to $7,506 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $6,550 for the three months ended December 31,
2021. This increase of $956 is primarily attributable to exchange rate movements over the period when compared to the same period in
2021.
Occupancy
expenses decreased to $13,879 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $14,286 for the six months ended December 31,
2021. This decrease of $407 is primarily attributable to exchange rate movements over the period when compared to the same period in
2021.
Research
and Development Expenses
Research
and development expenses were increased to $74,878 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $50,753 for the three
months ended December 31, 2021. Research and development expenses were increased to $176,203 for the six months ended December 31, 2022
as compared to $97,307 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable
to the two-year collaboration agreement with University of Jaén which was executed in October 2020 to provide certain research
services to the Company. Additionally, on July 27, 2022, the Company entered into another two-year research agreement with the University
of Jaén to provide certain research and experiment services to the Company.
Interest
Expense
Interest
expense decreased to $98,619 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $177,905 for the three months ended December
31, 2021. Interest expense is primarily comprised of approximately $81,000 of debt discount amortization and accretion of put premium
and interest expense from accrual of interest expense and other financing fees for a total of approximately $18,000 for the three months
ended December 31, 2022. This decrease in interest expense of $79,286 is primarily attributable to the decrease of approximately $126,000
in accretion of put premium offset by increase in amortization of debt discount of approximately $47,000.
Interest
expense decreased to $261,371 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $287,758 for the six months ended December 31,
2021. Interest expense is primarily comprised of approximately $229,000 of debt discount amortization and accretion of put premium and
interest expense from accrual of interest expense and other financing fees for a total of approximately $32,000 for the six months ended
December 31, 2022. This decrease in interest expense of $26,387 is primarily attributable to the decrease of approximately $99,000 in
accretion of put premium offset by increase in amortization of debt discount of approximately $73,000.
Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities
Change
in fair value of derivative liabilities were increased to a gain of $62,335 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared
to a loss of $163,853 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Change in fair value of derivative liabilities were increased to
a gain of $127,508 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a loss of $167,757 for the six months ended December 31,
2021. This increase in gain during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $226,000 and $295,000, respectively,
is primarily attributable to a decrease in fair value of the principal amount of convertible notes with bifurcated embedded conversion
option derivatives as a result of the decrease in stock prices during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
4
Gain
from Settlement of accounts payable
Gain
from settlement of accounts payable was $17,499 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $0 for the six months ended
December 31, 2021. On August 16, 2022, the Company and a third-party investor relations consultant agreed to settle an outstanding payable
of $23,050 in exchange for 2,305,000 warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock at $0.01 per share with an expiry date of
August 16, 2025 and fair market value of $5,551. Accordingly, the Company recognized gain from settlement of accounts payable of $17,499
during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Gain
on Extinguishment of Debt, net
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, notes with principal amounts totaling $79,000 and accrued interest of $9,543 contained bifurcated
embedded conversion option derivatives. Accordingly, the fair market value of the shares issued was $195,952, resulting in a loss on
extinguishment at the time of conversion of $107,409 and $106,799 of derivative fair value liability was recorded as a gain on extinguishment
at the time of conversion, resulting in a net loss of $610.
Additionally,
during the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized the remaining put premium of $43,520 related to a convertible note
into gain on extinguishment of debt during the six months ended December 31, 2022. The lender of such convertible note agreed to surrender
all conversion rights in its currently held convertible notes due to violation of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.
Foreign
Currency Transaction Gain (Loss)
Foreign
currency transaction gain decreased to a loss of $13,988 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a loss of $110,215
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Foreign currency transaction gain increased to a gain of $22,235 for the six months ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to a loss of $1,086 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of approximately $96,000 and
$23,000 is partially attributable to the increase in exchange rates during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.
Net
loss
Net
loss decreased to $485,418 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a net loss of $799,977 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021. Net loss decreased to $1,102,713 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a net loss of $1,290,635
for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The change relates to the factors discussed above.
Deemed
dividend
The
Company recognized the value of the effect of a down round feature related to our Series A warrants when triggered. Upon the occurrence
of the triggering event that resulted in a reduction of the strike price, the Company measured the value of the effect of the feature
as the difference between the fair value of the warrants without the down round feature or before the strike price reduction and the
fair value of the warrants with a strike price corresponding to the reduced strike price upon the down round feature being triggered.
Accordingly, the Company recognized deemed dividends of $19,322 and $93,398 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, and a corresponding reduction of income available to common stockholders upon the alternate cashless exercise of these
warrants during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recognized deemed dividend of $408,557 and
$208,242 during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a corresponding reduction of income available to common
stockholders upon the alternate cashless exercise of these warrants during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Net
loss available to common stockholders
Net
loss available to common stockholders decreased to $504,740 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a net loss available
to common stockholders of $893,375 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Net loss available to common stockholders increased
to $1,511,270 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a net loss available to common stockholders of $1,498,877 for
the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The
decrease and increase during the three- and six-months period are primarily attributable to the change relates to the factors discussed
above.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Current
Financial Condition
As
of December 31, 2022, we had total assets of $108,022, comprised primarily of cash of $24,476, GST tax receivable of $4,543, prepaid
expenses and other current assets of $25,207, security deposit of $2,042, operating lease ROU asset, net of $50,671, and property and
equipment, net of $1,083. As compared to June 30, 2022, we had total assets of $81,651, comprised primarily of cash of $4,067, GST tax
receivable of $2,342, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8,621, property and equipment, net, of $2,023, operating lease ROU
asset, net of $62,523, and security deposit of $2,075.
We
had current liabilities of $2,992,554, primarily comprised of net convertible debt of $633,740, note payable, net of $72,404, loan payable
of $65,280, accrued interest of $59,733, accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,470,605, employee benefit liability of $578,453,
and embedded conversion option liabilities of $10,623 as of December 31, 2022. As compared to June 30, 2022, we had current liabilities
of $3,062,981, primarily comprised of net convertible debt of $926,438, accrued interest of $57,822, accounts payable and accrued expenses
of $1,409,138, employee benefit liability of $415,799, and embedded conversion option liabilities of $151,262.
We
have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity and/or convertible debt securities for cash. The cash was used primarily
for payments for research and development, administration expenses, occupancy expenses, professional fees, consultants and travel.
5
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022 we received proceeds from exercise of warrants of $200,000, proceeds from issuance of convertible
notes and note payable of $495,750, proceeds from sale of shares of our Common Stock of $24,711 and proceeds from collection of subscription
receivables of $23,758.
We
have substantial capital resource requirements and have incurred significant losses since inception. As of December 31, 2022, we had
$24,476 in cash. We depend upon debt and/or equity financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our current business plan.
Such capital requirements are in excess of what we have in available cash and for which we currently have commitments. Therefore, we
presently do not have enough available cash to meet our obligations over the next 12 months. If continued funding and capital resources
are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may curtail our plan of operations. We will be required to obtain alternative or additional financing
from financial institutions, investors or otherwise, in order to maintain and expand our existing operations. The failure by us to obtain
such financing would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations, and adversely affecting
our ability to complete ongoing activities in connection with our research and development programs.

issuance of convertible notes and a note payable of $495,750.
Net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2021 were $789,500 as compared to $358,044 for the six months
ended December 31, 2020. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, we received proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $375,000
and net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes of $414,500.
Effect
of Exchange Rate
The
effect of the exchange rate on cash resulted in a $10,732 positive adjustment to cash flows in the six months ended December 31, 2022,
as compared to a $7,046 negative adjustment to cash flows in the six months ended December 31, 2021. The reason for the fluctuation is
due to the application of currency translation rates throughout the cash flow statement, the volume of transactions within each period
and the daily fluctuation in exchange rates.
Critical
Accounting Estimates
Below
is a discussion of our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining (i) the methodology used in calculating
the estimates, (ii) the inherent uncertainties pertaining to such estimates, and (iii) the possible effects of a significant variance
in actual experience, from that of the estimate, on our financial condition. Estimates involve numerous assumptions that, if incorrect,
could create a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Foreign
Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss) : The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary’s functional currency is
the AUD. For financial reporting purposes, the Australian Dollar (“AUD”) has been translated into USD as the Company’s
reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses
are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. Equity transactions are translated at each historical
transaction date spot rate. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included
as a component of stockholders’ equity (deficit) as “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Gains and losses
resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as other income (expense).
Effective fiscal year 2021, the parent company determined that intercompany loans will not be repaid in the foreseeable future and thus,
per ASC 830-20-35-3, gains and losses from measuring the intercompany balances are recorded within cumulative translation adjustment,
a component of other comprehensive income.
Accounting
for Income Taxes:
We are governed by Australian income tax laws and United States income tax laws, which are administered by the
Australian Taxation Office and the United States Internal Revenue Service, respectively. We follow ASC 740, “ Accounting for
Income Taxes,”
which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets
and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or
minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The
Company adopted provisions of ASC 740, Sections 25 through 60, “ Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes .” These
sections provide detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized
in the financial statements. Tax positions must meet a “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold at the effective date
to be recognized upon the adoption of ASC 740 and in subsequent periods.
Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation : We record stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “ Stock Compensation ”
and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 issued by the SEC in March 2005 regarding its interpretation of ASC 718. ASC 718 requires the fair
value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related requisite service period.
The statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding
at the date of adoption. We value any employee or non-employee stock-based compensation at fair value using the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing Model.
We
account for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC 718.
Derivative
Instruments:
ASC 815, “ Derivatives and Hedging, ” establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings. On the date of conversion, or payoff,
of debt, we record the fair value of the conversion shares, remove the fair value of the related derivative liability, remove any discounts
and record a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.
Convertible
Notes with Variable Conversion Options : We have entered into convertible notes, some of which contain variable conversion options,
whereby the outstanding principal and accrued interest may be converted, by the holder, into common shares at or around a fixed discount
to the price of the common stock at the time of conversion. We treat these convertible notes as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and
measure the fair value of the notes at the time of issuance, which is the result of the share price discount at the time of conversion,
and record the put premium as accretion to interest expense.
Research
and Development Tax Credits : We may apply for Research and Development tax concessions with the Australian Taxation Office on an
annual basis. Although the amount is possible to estimate at year end, the Australian Taxation Office may reject or materially alter
the claim amount. Accordingly, we do not recognize the benefit of the claim amount until cash receipt since collectability is not certain
until such time. The tax concession is a refundable credit. If we have net income then we can receive the credit which reduces its income
tax liability. If we have net losses, then we may still receive a cash payment for the credit, however, our net operating loss carry
forwards are reduced by the gross equivalent loss that would produce the credit amount when the income tax rate is applied to that gross
amount. The concession is recognized as an income tax benefit, in operations, upon receipt.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Please
see section captioned “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.
Going
Concern Qualification
We
did not generate any revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and have incurred significant losses and cash used in
operations, and such losses and use of cash are expected to continue. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included
a “Going Concern Qualification” in its audit report for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. In addition,
we have negative working capital and convertible debt that is past maturity that we are currently negotiating with lenders in order to
amend the maturity dates. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12
months from the issue date of this report. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our strategy
and on our ability to raise additional funds and/or to consummate a public offering. Management is currently seeking additional funds,
primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any
future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain
additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution
for our stockholders, in case of equity and/or convertible debt financing. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The “Going Concern Qualification” might make it substantially more
difficult to raise capital.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) that are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and
procedures” in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management
recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures.
At
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we conducted an evaluation (the “Evaluation”), under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022, the disclosure controls and procedures of our Company were not effective to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports was recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis due to the material
weaknesses in financial reporting as discussed below.
Material
Weaknesses and Corrective Actions
The
framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “2013 Internal Control
- Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, (“COSO”). In
connection with the audits of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we identified certain deficiencies
relating to our internal control over financial reporting that constitute a material weakness under standards established by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
within the meaning of PCAOB Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
The
following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist at December 31, 2022:
●
we
do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);
●
we
do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our limited size
and early-stage nature of operations, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically
feasible; however, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions
should be performed by separate individuals;
●
we
lack an audit committee of our board of directors; and
●
we
have insufficient monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process, including the lack of individuals
with current knowledge of US GAAP.
We
outsource certain of the functions that would normally be performed by a principal financial officer to assist us in implementing the
necessary financial controls over the financial reporting and the utilization of internal management and staff to effectuate these controls.
We
believe that these material weaknesses primarily relate, in part, to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in US GAAP
and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial reporting functions, and the lack of robust accounting systems, as well as the
lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement these accounting systems.
Subject
to raising sufficient additional capital, we plan to take a number of actions in the future to correct these material weaknesses including,
but not limited to, establishing an audit committee of our board of directors comprised of at least two independent directors, adding
experienced accounting and financial personnel and retaining third-party consultants to review our internal controls and recommend improvements.
We will need to take additional measures to fully mitigate these issues, and the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve
our internal controls may not be sufficient to (1) address the issues identified, (2) ensure that our internal controls are effective
or (3) ensure that the identified material weakness or other material weaknesses will not result in a material misstatement of our annual
or interim financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses may be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct
deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately
and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect
the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information,
subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial
condition.
Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
