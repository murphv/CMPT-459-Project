BASIS OF PRESENTATION   Principles of consolidation   The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements (referred to as the “Financial Statements” herein) include the accounts of Scholastic Corporation (the “Corporation”) and all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Scholastic” or the “Company”). Intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
The Company’s fiscal year is not a calendar year. Accordingly, references in this document to fiscal 2023 relate to the twelve-month period ending May 31, 2023.
Noncontrolling Interest The Company owns a
95.0 % majority ownership interest in Make Believe Ideas Limited ("MBI"), a UK-based children's book publishing company. The founder and chief executive officer of MBI retains a
5.0 % noncontrolling ownership interest in MBI. The Company fully consolidated MBI as of the acquisition date, and the
5.0 % noncontrolling interest is classified within stockholder's equity. Interim Financial Statements
The accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial information, and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. The Financial Statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, the Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Financial Statements for the periods presented.   Seasonality   The Company’s  Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution  school-based book club and book fair channels and most of its
Education Solutions
businesses operate on a school-year basis; therefore, the Company’s business is highly seasonal. As a result, the Company’s revenues in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year generally are lower than its revenues in the other two fiscal quarters. Typically, school-based channels and magazine revenues are minimal in the first quarter of the fiscal year as schools are not in session. Education channel revenues are generally higher in the fourth quarter. Trade sales can vary throughout the year due to varying release dates of published titles.
Use of estimates   The preparation of these Financial Statements involves the use of estimates and assumptions by management, which affects the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, all of which are necessary, in order to form a basis for determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates the adequacy of its reserves and the estimates used in these calculations, including, but not limited to: • Accounts receivable allowance for credit losses
• Pension and postretirement benefit plans
• Uncertain tax positions • The timing and amount of future income taxes and related deductions • Inventory reserves • Cost of goods sold from book fair operations during interim periods based on estimated gross profit rates • Sales tax contingencies • Royalty advance reserves and royalty expense accruals • Impairment testing for goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets and investments 9 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) • Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations • Variable consideration related to anticipated returns • Allocation of transaction price to contractual performance obligations Sale of Long-lived Assets There were
no
sales of long-lived assets during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 4, Asset Write Down and Sale, for details regarding the disposition of the direct sales business in Asia completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company sold a facility, which included office and warehouse space, located in Lake Mary, Florida as part of an initiative to rightsize its real estate footprint to reduce occupancy costs. The long-lived assets, which consisted of land, building, building improvements, furniture and fixtures, were included in the
Children's Book Publishing and Distribution
segment. These assets had a carrying value of $ 4.2
and were classified as held for sale as of the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The net proceeds from the sale were $ 10.4
and the Company recognized a gain on sale of $ 6.2 . This amount is included within Gain (loss) on sale of assets and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2022, ASU No. 2022-6, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date for Topic 848" was issued. Refer to the Current Fiscal Year Adoptions section below for further details. Refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 for more information on current applicable authoritative guidance and its impact on the Company's financial statements. Current Fiscal Year Adoptions: ASU No. 2021-8 The Company adopted ASU No. 2021-8, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers" (ASU 2021-8), in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The updates in this guidance seek to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the following: 1. Recognition of an acquired contract liability and 2. Payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The amendments in ASU 2021-8 improve comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination. The amendments improve comparability by specifying for all acquired revenue contracts regardless of their timing of payment: (1) the circumstances in which the acquirer should recognize contract assets and contract liabilities that are acquired in a business combination and (2) how to measure those contract assets and contract liabilities. The amendments improve comparability after the business combination by providing consistent recognition and measurement guidance for revenue contracts with customers acquired in a business combination and revenue contracts with customers not acquired in a business combination. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-8 and applied the amendments in accounting for the acquisition of Learning Ovations, Inc. during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. ASU No. 2020-4 and ASU No. 2022-6 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-4, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting" (ASU 2020-4), and in December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-6, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date for Topic 848" (ASU 2022-6). ASU 2020-4 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. This guidance is elective and applies to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU 2022-6 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company adopted the expedient in accounting for the amendments to the Company's Credit Agreement which were made as a result of the replacement of LIBOR as a reference rate. Refer to Note 5, Debt, for further details regarding the interest

Losses The Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses on customer receivables that are expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the receivable.

The Company reviews new information as it becomes available and makes adjustments to the reserves accordingly. At the time the Company determines that a receivable balance, or any portion thereof, is deemed to be permanently uncollectible, the balance is then written off.

US Credit Agreement On October 27, 2021, Scholastic Corporation and its principal operating subsidiary, Scholastic Inc., entered into an amended and restated
5-year
credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a
$ 300.0
unsecured revolving credit facility and allows the Company to borrow, repay or prepay and reborrow at any time prior to the October 27, 2026 maturity date. The Credit Agreement also provides an unlimited basket for permitted payments of
dividends and other distributions in respect of capital stock so long as the Corporation’s pro forma Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as defined, is not in excess of
2.75 :1. On February 28, 2023, the Company entered into the First and Second Amendments to the Credit Agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto, Truist Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (collectively the "Amendments"). The Amendments, among other things, (i) adjusted the credit spread adjustment for SOFR (the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) to
0.10 % (10 basis points) and (ii) transitioned the reference rate under the Credit Agreement for borrowings from LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate) to SOFR, together with various other conforming changes to accommodate such replacement. Under the Credit Agreement, interest on amounts borrowed thereunder is due and payable in arrears on the last day of the interest period (defined as the period commencing on the date of the advance and ending on the last day of the period selected by the Borrower at the time each advance is made). The interest pricing under the Credit Agreement is dependent upon the Borrower’s election of a rate that is either: • a Base Rate equal to the higher of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the prevailing Federal Funds rate plus
0.50 % or (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus
1.00 % plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from
0.35 % to
0.75 %, as determined by the Company’s prevailing Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement); - or - • a Eurodollar Rate equal to SOFR (Daily Simple or Term), plus a SOFR adjustment of
0.10 % per annum and an applicable margin ranging from
1.35 % to
1.75 %, as determined by the Company’s prevailing Consolidated Leverage Ratio. As of February 28, 2023, the applicable margin on Base Rate Advances was
0.35 % and the applicable margin on Eurodollar Advances was
1.35 %, both based on the Company’s prevailing Consolidated Leverage Ratio. The Credit Agreement provides for payment of a commitment fee in respect of the aggregate unused amount of revolving credit commitments ranging from
0.20 % per annum to
0.30 % per annum based upon the Corporation’s then prevailing Consolidated Leverage Ratio. As of February 28, 2023, the commitment fee rate was
0.20 %.
A portion of the revolving credit facility, up to a maximum of $ 50.0 , is available for the issuance of letters of credit. In addition, a portion of the revolving credit facility, up to a maximum of $ 15.0 , is available for swingline loans. The Credit Agreement has an accordion feature which permits the Company, provided certain conditions are satisfied, to increase the facility by up to an additional $ 150.0 . As of February 28, 2023, the Company had
no
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to leverage and interest coverage ratios (as defined in the Credit Agreement), limitations on the amount of dividends and other distributions, and other limitations on fundamental changes to the Company or its business. The Company was in compliance with required covenants for all periods presented. At February 28, 2023, the Company had open standby letters of credit totaling $ 4.1
issued under certain credit lines, including $ 0.4
under the Credit Agreement and $ 3.7
under the domestic credit lines discussed below.

no
outstanding borrowings under these credit lines as of February 28, 2023, May 31, 2022 and February 28, 2022. As of February 28, 2023, availability under these unsecured money market bid rate credit lines totaled $ 6.3 .
All loans made under these credit lines are at the sole discretion of the lender and at an interest rate and term agreed to at the time each loan is made, but not to exceed
365
days. These credit lines may be renewed, if requested by the Company, at the option of the lender. As of February 28, 2023, the Company had various local currency international credit lines totaling $ 24.3
underwritten by banks primarily in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Outstanding borrowings under these facilities were $ 5.2
at February 28, 2023 at a weighted average interest rate of

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal Matters Various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business are pending against the Company. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. When only a range can be estimated, the most probable amount in the range is accrued unless no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, in which case the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Legal costs associated with litigation are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The Company does not expect, in the case of those various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business where a loss is considered probable or reasonably possible, that the reasonably possible losses from such claims and lawsuits (either individually or in the aggregate) would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company received $ 5.0
in recoveries from its insurance programs related to photo litigation settlements accrued and paid in prior periods. The recoveries were recognized as an offset to the legal settlements and reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the quarter ended February 28, 2023. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company received $ 6.6
in recoveries from its insurance programs related to an intellectual property legal settlement, which was accrued in fiscal 2021. The recoveries were recognized as an offset to the legal settlement and reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the quarter ended February 28, 2022. While the Company expects to receive additional recoveries from its insurance programs, it is premature to determine with any level of probability or accuracy the amount of those recoveries at this time. 13 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 7.

ACQUISITIONS On September 1, 2022, the Company acquired
100 % of the share capital of Learning Ovations, Inc., a U.S.-based education technology business and developer of a literacy assessment and instructional system, for $ 11.1 , net of
cash acquired. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. Fair values were assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired, including cash, receivables, and technology/know-how. The receivables acquired had a fair value of $ 0.1
and have been substantially collected as of February 28, 2023. The Company utilized internally-developed discounted cash flow forecasts to determine the fair value of the technology/know-how using a discount rate of
17.5 % to account for the relative risks of the estimated future cash flows. The Company classified this as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of these significant unobservable inputs. The fair values of the net assets were $ 4.2
which included $ 4.1
of amortizable intangible assets attributable to the technology/know-how. This acquisition resulted in $ 7.0
of goodwill that was assigned to the Company's
Education Solutions
segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations of this business subsequent to the acquisition are included in the
Education Solutions
segment. The transaction was not determined to be material to the Company's results and therefore pro forma financial information is not presented. 14 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 9.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   The Company determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for each fair value measurement of assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the Company’s financial statements. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs, which refer to assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, based upon the highest and best use, into three levels as follows:   • Level 1
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. • Level 2
Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.   • Level 3
Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which are significant to the fair value measurement and require the Company to develop its own assumptions. 19 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value consisted of cash and cash equivalents, debt and foreign currency forward contracts. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and short-term investments, such as money market funds, the fair value of which is based on quoted market prices, a Level 1 fair value measure. The Company employs Level 2 fair value measurements for the disclosure of the fair value of its various lines of credit and long term debt. The fair value of the Company's debt approximates the carrying value for all periods presented. The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts, used by the Company to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, are based on quotations from financial institutions, a Level 2 fair value measure. Non-financial assets for which the Company employs fair value measures on a non-recurring basis include: • Long-lived assets, including held for sale • Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets • Investments • Assets acquired in a business combination • Impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets Level 2 and Level 3 inputs are employed by the Company in the fair value measurement of these assets. For the fair value measurements employed by the Company for certain property, plant and equipment, investments and prepublication assets, the Company assessed future expected cash flows attributable to these assets. See Note 10, Investments, for a more complete description of the fair value measurements employed. For the fair value measurements employed by the Company for certain acquired intangible assets, the Company utilized internally-developed discounted cash flow forecasts. See Note 8, Acquisitions, for further details regarding the acquired assets and fair value measurements employed. 16.
INCOME TAXES AND OTHER TAXES Tax Legislation Updates In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which, among other things, included provisions related to the carry back of net operating losses and the Employee Retention Credit. The Company applied these provisions as applicable. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company received a federal tax refund of $ 63.1
primarily related to the carry back of net operating losses generated in the U.S. In fiscal 2021, the Company applied for employee retention credits in the U.S. and the related receivable was $ 9.3
as of February 28, 2023.
Income Taxes
In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon currently known facts and circumstances and applies that rate to its year-to-date earnings or losses. The Company’s effective tax rate is based on expected income and statutory tax rates and takes into consideration permanent differences between financial statement and tax return income applicable to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The effect of discrete items, such as changes in estimates, changes in rates or tax status, and unusual or infrequently occurring events, is recognized in the interim period in which the discrete item occurs. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained or as the result of new judicial interpretations or regulatory or tax law changes. The Company's interim effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete items, for the three and nine month periods ended February 28, 2023 was
26.3 % and
36.3 %, respectively, compared to
23.7 % and
19.7 %, respectively, for the prior fiscal year period. The interim effective tax rate for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 varied from the prior fiscal year period primarily due to a GILTI inclusion in the period ended February 28, 2023 and the release of reserves related to the IRS examination recognized in the prior period. The interim effective tax rate for the
nine months ended February 28, 2023 varied from the statutory rate due to tax shortfalls related to vested option cancellations in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company, including its domestic subsidiaries, files a consolidated U.S. income tax return, and also files tax returns in various states and other local jurisdictions. Also, certain subsidiaries of the Company file income tax
20 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) returns in foreign jurisdictions. The Company is routinely audited by various tax authorities. The Company was previously under audit for the fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2020 tax years and the examination was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with no impact to the financial results. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company received a federal tax refund of $ 9.8 , inclusive of interest, which was released due to the completion of the IRS examination. As of February 28, 2023, there was approximately $ 11.9
in receivables from the IRS related to the years previously under audit included in Income tax receivable in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. Non-income Taxes   The Company is subject to tax examinations for sales-based taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing and, in certain cases, have resulted in assessments from taxing authorities. The Company assesses sales tax contingencies for each jurisdiction in which it operates, considering all relevant facts including statutes, regulations, case law and experience. Where a sales tax liability with respect to a jurisdiction is probable and can be reliably estimated for such jurisdiction, the Company has made accruals for these matters which are reflected in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts are included in the Financial
Statements in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Future developments relating to the foregoing could result in adjustments being made to these accruals. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a benefit of $ 1.8
related to a
favorable settlement of certain legacy sales tax matters. 17.
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING   The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts to economically hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with the forecasted purchase of inventory, the foreign exchange risk associated with certain receivables denominated in foreign currencies and certain future commitments for foreign expenditures. These derivative contracts are economic hedges and are not designated as cash flow hedges.
The Company marks-to-market these instruments and records the changes in the fair value of these items in Selling, general and administrative expenses and recognizes the unrealized gain or loss in Other current assets or Other current liabilities. The notional values of the contracts as of February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022 were $ 22.8
and $ 21.9 , respectively. A net unrealized gain of $ 0.6
and $ 0.3
were recognized for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022, respectively.

OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES   Other accrued expenses consisted of the following as of the dates indicated:    February 28, 2023 May 31, 2022 February 28, 2022 Accrued payroll, payroll taxes and benefits $ 31.6   $ 32.2   $ 35.3   Accrued bonus and commissions 21.8   44.2   22.5   Returns liability 44.8   42.2   48.8   Accrued other taxes 20.5   26.8   30.2   Accrued advertising and promotions 8.8   10.3   15.1   Other accrued expenses 36.4   37.6   32.9   Total accrued expenses $ 163.9   $ 193.3   $ 184.8   19.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   On January 12, 2022, the Company entered into a share repurchase agreement to purchase shares of its common stock from the Estate of M. Richard Robinson, Jr. in a privately negotiated transaction. Pursuant to the repurchase agreement, the Company purchased
300,000
shares of common stock on January 19, 2022 at a price of $ 40.65
per share, representing an aggregate purchase price of $ 12.2 . The price per share paid represented a
4.2 % discount to the closing price of the stock, $ 42.43 , on the date of execution of the repurchase agreement. The repurchase was made pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase program as previously approved by the Board. The aforementioned transaction was approved by the Board upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On March 22, 2023, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.20
per share on the Company’s Class A and Common Stock for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The dividend is payable on June 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 28, 2023. On March 22, 2023, the Board also authorized an increase of $ 50.0
for Common share repurchases under the Company's share buy-back program, resulting in a current Board authorization of $ 75.2 , which includes $ 28.2
remaining from the previous Board authorization less share repurchases of $ 3.0
subsequent to February 28, 2023. 22 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) Overview and Outlook Revenues for the third quarter ended February 28, 2023 were $324.9 million, compared to $344.5 million in the prior fiscal year quarter, a decrease of $19.6 million or 6%. The Company reported net loss per diluted share of Class A and Common Stock of $0.57 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to a net loss per diluted share of $0.44 in the prior fiscal year quarter. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company's trade channel continued to be impacted by the softening retail demand for children’s books in the U.S. and major international markets. Despite the foregoing, the
Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution
segment revenues grew in the quarter with continued strong performance in the book fairs channel reflecting investments in innovation and improved fair experiences since the pandemic, as well as Scholastic’s unique and trusted position in schools. Ongoing delays in school and school districts’ purchasing of instructional materials as they focus on managing staffing shortages and changes to the methods for literacy instruction contributed to lower revenues in
Education Solutions . The
International
segment experienced trends similar to the U.S. markets with lower revenues in the trade channels partially offset by improvements in book fairs sales. Operating loss increased $8.2 million, or 42%, from the prior fiscal year quarter primarily driven by the lower revenues and the continued impact of inflationary pressures on costs, in addition to decreased profit contribution from the
Education Solutions
segment, which included increased spending on long-term strategic investments. The Company expects continued improvement in the book fairs businesses around the world, most notably in the U.S. which continues to outperform fiscal 2022 with higher fair count and improved revenue-per-fair. The trade channel will continue to release new titles from bestselling authors, including
Dog Man ®
#11: Twenty Thousand Fleas Under the Sea
by Dav Pilkey to be released at the end of March 2023, but expects unfavorable economic trends in the retail book markets to continue to negatively impact the channel both domestically and internationally. The
Education Solutions
segment will continue to focus on integration efforts related to the Learning Ovations acquisition as well as the upcoming launch of Ready4Reading TM , a new K-3 phonics program. The segment is preparing for the seasonally important fiscal fourth quarter, although the softness in the education instructional materials market could continue. Internationally, margins are expected to continue to benefit from the disposition of the direct sales business in Asia, which generated losses in the prior period, despite unfavorable economic conditions in the UK and Canada which are expected to continue to impact revenue growth and operating income, together with unfavorable foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar remains strong. The Company continues to monitor and control discretionary spending which is expected to continue to help mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures on freight and product costs. Results of Operations Consolidated Revenues for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 decreased by $19.6 million to $324.9 million, compared to $344.5 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. The
Children's Book Publishing and Distribution
segment revenues increased by $3.0 million, driven by higher book fairs channel revenues resulting from increased fair count and higher revenue per fair, substantially offset by lower trade channel revenues due to the industry-wide decline in the retail market for children's books and lower book clubs channel sales due to the timing of revenues in the prior year and a continued decline in order volumes. In the
Education Solutions
segment, revenues decreased by $7.2 million primarily due to lower sales of instructional products and programs as a result of purchasing delays by school and district administrators and changes to the methods for literacy instruction. In local currency, the
International
segment revenues decreased by $11.9 million, primarily driven by lower sales in Asia as a result of the disposition of the direct sales business, coupled with lower trade channel sales, largely in Canada, as a result of the industry-wide decline in retail sales as well as lower book clubs channel revenues in Australia and New Zealand.
International
segment revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of $3.5 million in the quarter ended February 28, 2023. Revenues for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 increased by $47.2 million to $1,175.7 million, compared to $1,128.5 million in the prior fiscal year period. The
Children's Book Publishing and Distribution
segment revenues increased by $77.7 million primarily driven by higher book fairs channel revenues resulting from increased fair count, higher revenue per fair and increased redemptions of book fair incentive program credits, partially offset by lower trade channel revenues due to the industry-wide decline in the retail market for
23 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) children's books and lower book clubs channel sales due to the multi-year trend of lower sponsor participation. In the
Education Solutions
segment, revenues decreased by $13.6 million primarily driven by lower sales of instructional products and programs due to purchasing delays by school and district administrators and changes to the methods for literacy instruction as well as the shifting of revenues from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to supply chain constraints at that time into the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In addition, the segment had lower sales of
Rising Voices Library ®
products. This was partially offset by revenues from sponsored programs and increased revenues from traditional classroom book collections. In local currency, the
International
segment revenues increased by $1.4 million primarily driven by increased revenues in the Company's Major Markets (Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand) as a result of the continued recovery of the book fairs channel, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia as a result of the disposition of the direct sales business.
International
segment revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of $18.3 million in the nine months ended February 28, 2023. Components of Cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022 are as follows:   Three months ended Nine months ended February 28, February 28, February 28, February 28,   2023 2022 2023 2022 ($ amounts in millions) $ % of Revenue $ % of Revenue $ % of Revenue $ % of Revenue Product, service and production costs and inventory reserves $ 96.2  29.6  % $ 93.8  27.2  % $ 337.2  28.7  % $ 306.6  27.2  % Royalty costs 24.8  7.6  % 30.0  8.7  % 97.6  8.3  % 102.8  9.1  % Prepublication amortization 6.3  2.0  % 6.8  2.0  % 19.1  1.6  % 20.6  1.8  % Postage, freight, shipping, fulfillment and other 33.8  10.4  % 39.0  11.3  % 112.1  9.5  % 110.9  9.8  % Total $ 161.1   49.6   % $ 169.6   49.2   % $ 566.0   48.1   % $ 540.9   47.9   % Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 was $161.1 million, or 49.6% of revenues, compared to $169.6 million, or 49.2% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year quarter. Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 was $566.0 million, or 48.1% of revenues, compared to $540.9 million, or 47.9% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year period. Cost of goods sold continued to be impacted by inflationary pressures which resulted in increased product costs due to higher print and inbound freight costs, substantially offset by lower royalty costs driven by the increased sales volume in the book fairs channel, which traditionally has a higher mix of non-royalty bearing titles. In addition, the
Education Solutions
segment recognized higher inventory reserves due to lower utilization of aged inventory. Favorable postage, freight, shipping and fulfillment costs as a percentage of revenue were driven by improved efficiencies at the Company's centralized distribution facility in Missouri which resulted in more units per shipment and fewer shipments to fulfill orders. During fiscal 2023, the Company purchased a substantial amount of inventory at higher costs to mitigate long lead times and these higher costs will be reflected in Cost of goods sold and impact margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 decreased to $178.0 million, compared to $180.8 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. The $2.8 million decrease was primarily attributable to overall lower costs in Asia as a result of the disposition of the direct sales business, a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit recognized in the book fairs channel in the quarter ended February 28, 2023 and lower severance expense from the Company's restructuring programs of $2.5 million. In addition, the Company received and recognized insurance recoveries of $5.0 million in the quarter ended February 28, 2023 related to photo litigation settlements paid in prior periods and also recognized a benefit related to the favorable settlement of certain legacy sales tax matters. The decrease was partially offset by increased labor costs, largely in the book fairs channel to support the increased fair count and in connection with the digital literacy platform integration efforts related to the Learning Ovations acquisition and the upcoming launch of Ready4Reading, in addition to increased marketing expenses in the book fairs channel associated with the increased fair count.
24 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 increased to $554.4 million, compared to $512.7 million in the prior fiscal year period. The $41.7 million increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, largely in the book fairs channel to support the increased fair count, coupled with the investment in the
Education Solutions
segment which included digital literacy platform integration efforts related to the Learning Ovations acquisition and the upcoming launch of Ready4Reading. The increase was also driven by the $6.6 million of insurance recoveries received in the period ended February 28, 2022 related to the intellectual property legal settlement
accrued in fiscal 2021 and higher marketing costs associated with sponsored programs. Partially offsetting this increase, the Company incurred lower severance expense from its restructuring programs of $5.7 million, recognized a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit in the book fairs channel in the period ended February 28, 2023 and incurred overall lower costs in Asia during the period ended February 28, 2023 as a result of the disposition of the direct sales business. The Company also received and recognized insurance recoveries of $5.0 million in the period ended February 28, 2023 related to photo litigation settlements paid in prior periods and recognized a benefit related to the favorable settlement of certain legacy sales tax matters.
Depreciation and amortization expenses in the three and nine months ended February 28, 2023 were $13.5 million and $41.0 million, respectively, compared to $13.6 million and $43.0 million, respectively, in the prior fiscal year period. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses in the three and nine months ended February 28, 2023 was primarily attributable to a shift towards spending on cloud computing arrangements in which the amortization expense is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses rather than Depreciation and amortization. Amortization related to cloud computing arrangements increased $0.1 million and $1.8 million for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, when compared to the prior period which substantially offset the decrease in Depreciation and amortization as there were no significant assets placed into service during the period ended February 28, 2023. Management expects the Company to continue to utilize more cloud-based software tools. Interest income in the three and nine months ended February 28, 2023 was $1.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, compared to less than $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in the prior fiscal year period. The Company invests excess cash in short term investments which earn competitive interest rates that change directionally in relation to the Federal Funds rate. Interest expense in the three and nine months ended February 28, 2023 was $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, compared to $0.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in the prior fiscal year period. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower average debt borrowings as compared to the prior fiscal year period as the outstanding borrowings on the U.S. credit agreement were paid down during fiscal 2022, resulting in no outstanding borrowings as of the beginning of fiscal 2023.
Gain (loss) on sale of assets and other in the nine months ended February 28, 2022 was $6.2 million. In the prior year period, the Company sold a facility, which included office and warehouse space, located in Lake Mary, Florida, as part of an initiative to rightsize its real estate footprint to reduce occupancy costs, which resulted in a gain on sale. The Company's interim effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete items, for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2023 was 26.3% and 36.3%, respectively, compared to 23.7% and 19.7%, respectively, for the prior fiscal year periods. The interim effective tax rate for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 varied from the prior fiscal year period primarily due to a GILTI inclusion in the period ended February 28, 2023 and the release of reserves related to the IRS examination recognized in the prior period. The interim effective tax rate for the
nine months ended February 28, 2023 varied from the statutory rate due to tax shortfalls related to vested option cancellations in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
Net loss attributable to Scholastic Corporation for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 increased by $3.9 million to $19.2 million, compared to $15.3 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. Loss per basic and diluted share of Class A and Common Stock was $0.57 and $0.57, respectively, for the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2023, compared to $0.44 and $0.44, respectively, in the prior fiscal year quarter. Net income attributable to Scholastic Corporation for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 decreased by $18.2 million to $10.6 million, compared to $28.8 million in the prior fiscal year period.

Revenues for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 increased by $3.0 million to $204.0 million, compared to $201.0 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. The increase in segment revenues was driven by higher book fairs channel revenues of $27.5 million, partially offset by lower revenues in the book clubs and trade channels of $12.8 million and $11.7 million, respectively. The improvement in the book fairs channel resulted from increased fair count, coupled with higher revenue per fair and increased redemptions of book fair incentive program credits. In the book clubs channel, decreased revenues resulted from the timing of revenues in the prior year, in which the discrete systems issue in the second quarter caused a backlog and shifted approximately $18 million of revenues into the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, coupled with a continued decline in order volumes. The trade channel continued to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in retail market sales, contributing to lower backlist sales as compared to the prior fiscal year quarter. In the quarter ended February 28, 2023, the trade channel released several new bestselling titles including

as well as increased sales in the

business. Revenues for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 increased by $77.7 million to $747.0 million, compared to $669.3 million in the prior fiscal year period. The increase in segment revenues was driven by higher book fairs channel revenues of $104.4 million resulting from increased fair count, which continued to trend at 85% of pre-pandemic levels compared to 70% in the prior fiscal year period, coupled with higher revenue per fair and increased redemptions of book fair incentive program credits. Partially offsetting the improvement in the book fairs channel, the book clubs and trade channels experienced lower revenues of $7.6 million and $19.1 million, respectively. In the book clubs channel, decreased revenues resulted from the multi-year trend of lower sponsor participation and fewer events held in the period ended February 28, 2023. The trade channel was impacted by the industry-wide decline in retail market sales, coupled with the prior fiscal year period release of

and benefited from increased media revenue as the Company continued to deliver episodes associated with the production of the animated series "Eva the Owlet" TM . The unfavorable economic trends in the retail book markets could continue to negatively impact the trade channel. Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 was $103.7 million, or 50.8% of revenues, compared to $102.5 million, or 51.0% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year quarter. Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 was $361.4, or 48.4% of revenues, compared to $325.4, or 48.6% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year period. The segment benefited from lower royalty costs as a percentage of revenues driven by the increased sales volume in the book fairs channel, which traditionally has a higher mix of non-royalty bearing titles, substantially offset by increased product costs due to higher print and inbound freight costs which continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures. Other operating expenses for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 increased to $98.4 million, compared to $93.5 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. Other operating expenses increased $4.9 million primarily driven by higher marketing expenses in the book fairs channel associated with the increased fair count. In addition,
26 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) increased labor costs, largely in the book fairs channel to support the increased fair count, were partially offset by a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit recognized in the quarter ended February 28, 2023.
Other operating expenses for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 increased to $300.6 million, compared to $275.4 million in the prior fiscal year period. Other operating expenses increased $25.2 million primarily attributable to increased labor costs, largely in the book fairs channel to support the increased fair count, which is expected to continue to trend higher during the remainder of fiscal 2023. The higher labor costs were partially offset by a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit recognized in the quarter ended February 28, 2023. In addition, the book fairs channel incurred higher fuel charges, marketing expenses and bank fees as a result of the increased fair count as well as increased rent for warehouse space.
Segment operating income for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 was $1.9 million, compared to $5.0 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. The $3.1 million decrease in operating income was attributable to the rising costs associated with freight, paper and labor, which continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures. In addition, increased margins from the book fairs channel were offset by lower revenues in the trade and book clubs channels.
Segment operating income for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 was $85.0 million, compared to $68.5 million in the prior fiscal year period. The $16.5 million increase in operating income was driven by higher revenues from the book fairs channel as fair count and revenue per fair continued to exceed the prior period, partially offset by the rising costs associated with freight, paper, labor and fuel, which continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures. In addition, increased margins from the book fairs channel were offset by lower revenues in the trade and book clubs channels.

Revenues for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 decreased by $7.2 million to $70.0 million, compared to $77.2 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. The decrease in segment revenues was primarily driven by lower sales of instructional products and programs, largely from the
Scholastic Bookroom
and
Guided Reading
offerings, which were impacted by purchasing delays and changes to the methods in which schools approach literacy instruction, as well as lower revenues from Scholastic Literacy Partners, a program that partners with mission-driven organizations to support literacy by increasing children's access to books. Partially offsetting this decrease, the segment had increased sales of products from the Scholastic Family and Community Engagement (FACE) TM
initiative. Revenues from Magazines+ TM , digital subscription products and sponsored programs remained relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year quarter. The delays in school and school districts’ purchasing of instructional materials could continue into the fourth quarter and impact the education channel.
Revenues for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 decreased by $13.6 million to $223.2 million, compared to $236.8 million in the prior fiscal year period. The decrease in segment revenues was largely driven by lower sales of instructional products and programs, primarily early childhood programs, summer learning product offerings, and offerings from the Company's
Scholastic Bookroom, Guided Reading
and
Scholastic Literacy
products. A substantial portion of the decrease related to instructional products and programs was due to the timing of revenues in the prior fiscal year period, which benefited from shipments, primarily consisting of summer learning products, that shifted from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to supply chain constraints at that time. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, orders were shipped more timely with fewer sales shifting into the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Purchasing delays by school and district administrators and changes to the methods in which schools approach literacy instruction also contributed to the lower revenues from
27 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) instructional products and programs. In addition, the segment had lower sales of
Rising Voices Library ®
products, professional books and teaching resource products. The overall decrease was partially offset by revenues from sponsored programs, which did not commence shipping until the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, and increased revenues from traditional classroom book collections,

initiative. Revenues from Magazines+ and digital subscription products remained relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year period.
Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 was $25.8 million, or 36.9% of revenues, compared to $26.1 million, or 33.8% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year quarter. The increase in Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to higher inventory reserves due to lower utilization of aged inventory, coupled with increased postage and outbound freight costs as the Company continues to be impacted by inflationary pressures. Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 was $84.8 million, or 38.0% of revenues, compared to $86.4 million, or 36.5% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year period. The increase in Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the mix of products sold in the period ended February 28, 2023 which had higher product costs, including higher inbound freight costs, in addition to increased postage and outbound freight costs, as the Company continues to be impacted by inflationary pressures. The segment also recognized higher inventory reserves due to lower utilization of aged inventory.
Other operating expenses for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 were $43.5 million, compared to $38.0 million in the prior fiscal year quarter, resulting in an increase of $5.5 million. The increase in Other operating expenses was primarily related to higher employee-related costs associated with digital literacy platform integration efforts related to the Learning Ovations acquisition and the upcoming launch of Ready4Reading.

by Alice Oseman. In Canada, local currency revenues were relatively consistent with the prior period, increasing $0.2 million. The Canadian book fair channel continued to recover resulting in revenue growth over the prior period, which was substantially offset by lower trade channel sales as a result of an industry wide decline in the retail market, in addition to lower sales in the book clubs channel. The increase in segment revenues from the Company's Major Markets was substantially offset by lower local currency revenues in Asia of $11.5 million primarily attributable to the disposition of the direct sales business as well as lower sales from the Asia export and trade channels. Export channel sales remained relatively consistent with the prior year, decreasing $0.1 million in local currency.
Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 was $33.7 million, or 66.2% of revenues, compared to $38.3 million, or 57.8% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year quarter. The increase in Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was impacted by continued inflationary pressures driving an increase in product costs, primarily in Canada and the UK, as a result of higher inbound freight costs as well as increased fulfillment costs due to increased labor costs, primarily in Canada. Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 was $127.0 million, or 61.8% of revenues, compared to $125.4 million, or 56.4% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year period. The increase in Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was impacted by continued inflationary pressures driving an overall increase in product costs as a result of higher inbound freight costs as well as higher outbound postage and freight costs. Fulfillment costs also increased due to higher labor costs, primarily in Canada. In addition, certain foreign operations, primarily Canada, purchase inventory in U.S. dollars and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar unfavorably impacted Cost of goods sold. 29 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) Other operating expenses for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 were $26.2 million, compared to $33.0 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. Other operating expenses decreased $6.8 million primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses, general overhead costs and bad debt expense in Asia as a result of the disposition of the direct sales business. In addition, the UK recognized branch consolidation costs of $0.3 million in the quarter ended February 28, 2022 which did not reoccur in the current year. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 were $84.3 million, compared to $95.0 million in the prior fiscal year period. Other operating expenses decreased $10.7 million primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses, general overhead costs and bad debt expense in Asia as a result of the disposition of the direct sales business. In addition, the segment incurred severance expense of $0.7 million related to restructuring programs and UK branch consolidation costs of $0.4 million in the period ended February 28, 2022, both of which did not reoccur in the current year. The discontinuation of government subsidies related to COVID-related governmental retention programs partially offset the decrease in Other operating expenses in which $1.4 million was recognized in the period ended February 28, 2022. Segment operating loss for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 was $9.0 million, compared to $5.0 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues in the trade market, primarily in Canada and the UK, as a result of an industry wide decline in the retail market, coupled with higher Cost of goods sold due to the impact of inflationary pressures on product and fulfillment costs. This was partially offset by improved operating margin in Asia as the Company has exited the direct sales business, which generated losses in the prior period. Segment operating loss for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 was $5.8 million, compared to operating income of $2.0 million in the prior fiscal year period. The decrease was primarily driven by higher Cost of goods sold due to the impact of inflationary pressures on product, freight and fulfillment costs as well as overall unfavorable economic conditions in Canada and the UK. This was partially offset by improved operating margin in Asia of approximately $3.0 million attributable to the exit from the direct sales business, which generated losses in the prior period. Overhead
Unallocated overhead expense for the quarter ended February 28, 2023 decreased by $11.3 million to $21.3 million, from $32.6 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to insurance recoveries received and recognized in the quarter ended February 28, 2023 related to photo litigation settlements paid in prior periods and a benefit related to the favorable settlement of certain legacy sales tax matters. In addition, the Company recognized severance and related charges from its restructuring programs of $2.4 million in the prior fiscal year quarter which did not reoccur in the quarter ended February 28, 2023.
Unallocated overhead expense for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 decreased by $6.3 million to $68.3 million, from $74.6 million in the prior fiscal year period. The decrease was primarily attributable to insurance recoveries received and recognized in the quarter ended February 28, 2023 related to photo litigation settlements paid in prior periods and a benefit related to the favorable settlement of certain legacy sales tax matters, as well as lower severance and related charges from the Company's restructuring programs of $5.0 million. This was partially offset by $6.6 million of insurance recoveries received and recognized in the period ended February 28, 2022 related to the intellectual property legal settlement accrued in fiscal 2021.
Seasonality The Company’s  Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution  school-based book club and book fair channels and most of its
Education Solutions
businesses operate on a school-year basis; therefore, the Company’s business is highly seasonal. As a result, the Company’s revenues in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year generally are lower than its revenues in the other two fiscal quarters. Typically, school-based channels and magazine revenues are minimal in the first quarter of the fiscal year as schools are not in session. Education channel revenues are generally higher in the fourth quarter. Trade sales can vary throughout the year due to varying release dates of published titles. 30 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities was $28.9 million for the nine months ended February 28, 2023, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $178.5 million for the prior fiscal year period, representing a decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $149.6 million. The decrease in cash provided was primarily driven by increased inventory purchases of approximately $114.0 million to mitigate long lead times related to continuing global supply chain challenges in order to meet expected demand. The decrease in cash provided was also impacted by the $63.1 million federal income tax refund in the prior period, increased spending on general expenses in the book fairs channel to support the increased fair count and
lower cash remittances related to book fairs incentive credits and digital subscriptions. This was partially offset by higher customer remittances on receivable balances in the period ended February 28, 2023 of approximately $80.0 million. Cash used in investing activities was $65.3 million for the nine months ended February 28, 2023, compared to $30.5 million in the prior fiscal year period, representing an increase in cash used in investing activities of $34.8 million. The increase in cash used was driven by payments related to the Learning Ovations acquisition of $10.7 million, higher capital expenditures of $8.8 million, primarily for new equipment at the Company's Jefferson City, Missouri distribution facility and book fairs warehouses to meet expected demand, as well as increased prepublication spending of $4.8 million associated with product development in
Education Solutions . In addition, the prior period included the net proceeds from the sale of the Lake Mary facility of $10.4 million which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Cash used in financing activities was $79.3 million for the nine months ended February 28, 2023, compared to cash used in financing activities of $202.9 million for the prior fiscal year period, representing a decrease in cash used in financing activities of $123.6 million. The decrease in cash used was primarily related to repayments of borrowings under the U.S. credit agreement of $175.0 million during the prior period, coupled with an increase in net proceeds from stock option exercises of $8.8 million in the period ended February 28, 2023. Partially offsetting this decrease, the Company repurchased $75.9 million of common stock, which included shares repurchased through a modified Dutch auction tender offer, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to common stock repurchases of $19.5 million in the prior fiscal year period. Cash Position
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $198.8 million at February 28, 2023, $316.6 million at May 31, 2022 and $308.9 million at February 28, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s U.S. operations totaled $166.0 million at February 28, 2023, $275.5 million at May 31, 2022 and $266.5 million at February 28, 2022. Due to the seasonal nature of its business as discussed under “Seasonality”, the Company usually experiences negative cash flows in the June through September time period. The Company’s operating philosophy is to use cash provided by operating activities to create value by paying down debt, reinvesting in existing businesses and, from time to time, making acquisitions that will complement its portfolio of businesses or acquiring other strategic assets, as well as engaging in shareholder enhancement initiatives, such as share repurchases or dividend declarations. During the nine months ended February 28, 2023, the Company repurchased $78.0 million of its common stock, which included shares repurchased through a modified Dutch auction tender offer during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and open-market repurchases. Under the Company's open-market buy-back program, $28.2 million remained available for future purchases of common shares as of February 28, 2023. Subsequent to February 28, 2023, the Board authorized an increase of $50.0 million for common stock repurchases, resulting in a current Board authorization of $75.2 million, which includes the remaining amount from the previous Board authorization less share repurchases of $3.0 million subsequent to February 28, 2023.
The Company has maintained, and expects to maintain for the foreseeable future, sufficient liquidity to fund ongoing operations, including working capital requirements, pension contributions, postretirement benefits, debt service, planned capital expenditures and other investments, as well as dividends and share repurchases. As of February 28, 2023, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $198.8 million, cash from operations and the Company's U.S. credit agreement. The Company expects the U.S. credit agreement to provide it with an appropriate level of flexibility to strategically manage its business operations. The Company's U.S. credit agreement, less commitments of $0.4 million, has $299.6 million of availability. Additionally, the Company has short-term credit facilities of $34.3 million, less current borrowings of
31 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) $5.2 million and commitments of $3.7 million, resulting in $25.4 million of current availability under these facilities at February 28, 2023. Accordingly, the Company believes these sources of liquidity are sufficient to finance its currently anticipated ongoing operating needs, as well as its financing and investing activities. Financing   The Company is party to the U.S. credit agreement and certain credit lines with various banks as described in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - unaudited in Item 1, “Financial Statements." The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the U.S. credit agreement as of February 28, 2023.
On February 28, 2023, the Company entered into the First and Second Amendments to the U.S. credit agreement which adjusted the credit spread adjustment for
SOFR (the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York)
to 0.10% and transitioned the reference rate from LIBOR (the
London interbank offered rate)
to SOFR. Reference is made to Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - unaudited in Item 1, “Financial Statements for further details. The Company is party to other loan agreements, notes or other documents or instruments which reference LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate index used to set the borrowing rate on certain short-term and variable-rate loans or advances. The ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) ceased the publication of 1-week and 2-month USD LIBORs effective December 31, 2021 and will cease overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month LIBORs effective June 30, 2023. The Company is working with its financial institutions to replace USD LIBOR with alternative reference rates in financial contracts as they mature or as the Company otherwise requires. The markets have provided several replacements for USD LIBOR, including the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) and the ARRC’s SOFR, either of which will be made available to the Company by its agent banks as a substitute for USD LIBOR. The Company does not believe that the change in reference rates will have any material effect on its ability to access the credit markets under its existing financing agreements, or its ability to modify or amend financial contracts, if required.

The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 32 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company conducts its business in various foreign countries, and as such, its cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company sells products from its domestic operations to its foreign subsidiaries, creating additional currency risk. The Company manages its exposures to this market risk through internally established procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of short-term forward exchange contracts, which were not significant as of February 28, 2023. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions or use other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Market risks relating to the Company’s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates in its variable-rate borrowings. The Company is subject to the risk that market interest rates and its cost of borrowing will increase and thereby increase the interest charged under its variable-rate debt. Additional information relating to the Company’s outstanding financial instruments is included in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - unaudited in Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The following table sets forth information about the Company’s debt instruments as of February 28, 2023: ($ amounts in millions) Fiscal Year Maturity   2023 (1) 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Fair Value at 02/28/2023 Debt Obligations                 Lines of credit and current   portion of long-term debt $ 5.2  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ 5.2  $ 5.2  Average interest rate 5.0  % —  —  —  —  —  (1) Fiscal 2023 includes the remaining three months of the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. 33 SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 4. Controls and Procedures The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation, after conducting an evaluation, together with other members of the Company’s management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of February 28, 2023, have concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in its reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and accumulated and communicated to members of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There was no change in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended February 28, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. 34 PART II – OTHER INFORMATION SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION Item 2.
