See accompanying notes. -6- Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 1.      Business and Basis of Presentation
Nature of Business Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. (referred to herein as the “Company” or “we,” which reference shall, unless the context requires otherwise, be deemed to refer to Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. and all of its direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) is engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of over-the-counter (“OTC”) healthcare products to mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience and club stores and e-commerce channels in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets.  Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. is a holding company with no operations and is also the parent guarantor of the senior credit facility and the senior notes described in Note 8 to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Economic Environment
There has been economic uncertainty in the United States and globally due to several factors including global supply chain constraints, rising interest rates, a high inflationary environment, geopolitical events and the effects from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We expect economic conditions will continue to be highly volatile and uncertain, put pressure on prices and supply, and could affect demand for our products.
In fiscal 2022, we experienced solid consumer consumption and share gains across most of our brand portfolio; however, that may not be sustained at the same levels in the uncertain economic environment.
We have continued to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including a reduction in the frequency of visits to retailers and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. The volatile environment has impacted the supply of labor and raw materials and exacerbated rising input costs.
Although we have not experienced a material disruption to our overall supply chain to date, we have and may continue to experience shortages, delays and backorders for certain ingredients and products, difficulty scheduling shipping for our products, as well as price increases from many of our suppliers for both shipping and product costs. In addition, labor shortages have impacted our manufacturing operations and may impact our ability to supply certain products to our customers. To date, the pandemic and other global conditions have not had a material negative impact on our operations, supply chain, overall costs or demand for most of our products or resulting aggregate sales and earnings, and, as such, it has also not negatively impacted our liquidity position.
We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs.
These circumstances could change, however, in this dynamic, unprecedented environment.
If conditions cause further disruption in the global supply chain, the availability of labor and materials or otherwise increase costs, it may materially affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including causing disruptions in the supply and distribution of our products. The extent to which these conditions impact our results and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and duration of any further COVID-19 outbreaks, global supply chain constraints, the high inflationary environment and further global instability. These effects could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations and those of the third parties on which we rely. Basis of Presentation The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  In the opinion of management, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that are considered necessary for a fair statement of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.  Our fiscal year ends on March 31st of each year.
References in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or related notes to a year (e.g., 2023) mean our fiscal year ending or ended on March 31st of that year.
Operating results for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.  These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. -7- Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Our most significant estimates include those made in connection with the valuation of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, fair value of debt, sales returns and allowances, trade promotional allowances, inventory obsolescence, and accounting for income taxes and related uncertain tax positions.    Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements There have been no accounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal 2023.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.
This ASU responds to feedback received by the FASB during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which we adopted effective April 1, 2020.
The amendments in this update, among other things, eliminate the troubled debt restructuring recognition and measurement guidance and, instead, require the entity to evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method .
The purpose of the ASU is to address questions raised on ASU 2017-12,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.
This ASU expands the currently used single-layer method of hedge accounting to allow multiple layers of a single closed portfolio under the method.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact of adoption of this new standard is not expected to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.
This ASU requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities in a business combination.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The impact of adoption of this new standard will depend on the magnitude of future acquisitions.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, "Topic 848").
Topic 848 provides optional guidance for contract modifications and certain hedging relationships associated with the transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued.
We will adopt Topic 848 when relevant contracts are modified upon transition to alternate reference rates, but no later than December 31, 2024.
The adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 2.
Acquisition Akorn On July 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the consumer health business assets from Akorn Operating Company LLC ("Akorn") pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated May 27, 2021 (the "Purchase Agreement"), for a purchase price of $ 228.9
million in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments specified in the Purchase Agreement.
As a result of the purchase, we acquired
TheraTears
and certain other over-the-counter consumer brands.
The financial results from this acquisition are included in our North American and International OTC Healthcare segments.
The purchase price was funded by a combination of available cash on hand, additional borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility entered into January 31, 2012, as amended (the "2012 ABL Revolver") and the net proceeds from the refinancing of our term loan entered into on January 31, 2012 (the "2012 Term Loan") (see Note 8). The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.
In connection with the acquisition, we entered into a supply arrangement with Akorn for a term of
three years
with optional renewals at prevailing market rates.
-8- We finalized our analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
The following table summarizes our allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the July 1, 2021 acquisition date. (In thousands) July 1, 2021 Inventories $ 6,455   Goodwill 1,098   Intangible assets 225,410   Total assets acquired 232,963 Accounts payable 428   Reserves for sales allowances
497   Other accrued liabilities 3,124   Total liabilities assumed 4,049   Total purchase price $ 228,914   Based on this analysis, we allocated $ 195.9  million to non-amortizable intangible assets and $ 29.5  million to amortizable intangible assets.
The non-amortizable intangible assets are classified as trademarks and, of the amortizable intangible assets, $ 20.4  million are classified as customer relationships and $ 9.1  million are classified as trademarks.
We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of
12.5
years (see Note 5). We recorded goodwill of $ 1.1  million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired (see Note 4).
Goodwill is deductible and is being amortized for income tax purposes.
The financial impact of this acquisition was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and, therefore, we have not presented pro forma results of operations for the acquisition.

-9- 4.      Goodwill
A reconciliation of the activity affecting goodwill by operating segment is as follows: (In thousands) North American OTC Healthcare International OTC
Healthcare Consolidated Balance - March 31, 2022 Goodwill $ 712,002   $ 32,272   $ 744,274   Accumulated impairment loss ( 163,711 ) ( 1,587 ) ( 165,298 ) Balance - March 31, 2022 548,291   30,685   578,976    Adjustment related to acquisition ( 550 ) —   ( 550 ) Effects of foreign currency exchange rates —   ( 1,824 ) ( 1,824 ) Balance - December 31, 2022 Goodwill 711,452   30,448   741,900   Accumulated impairment loss ( 163,711 ) ( 1,587 ) ( 165,298 ) Balance - December 31, 2022 $ 547,741   $ 28,861   $ 576,602   As discussed in Note 2, on July 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from Akorn.
In connection with this acquisition, we recorded goodwill of $ 1.1  million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the estimate of the fair value of the net assets acquired. On an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, management performs a review of the values assigned to goodwill and tests for impairment.
The date of our annual impairment review was February 28, 2022, and we recorded impairment charges to goodwill of $ 0.3
million in our March 31, 2022 financial statements.
We utilized the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as part of the goodwill impairment test.
We also considered our market capitalization at February 28, 2022 as compared to the aggregate fair values of our reporting units, to assess the reasonableness of our estimates pursuant to the discounted cash flow methodology.
The estimates and assumptions made in assessing the fair value of our reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties related to future sales, gross margins, and advertising and marketing expenses, which can be impacted by increases in competition, changing consumer preferences, technical advances, or the potential impacts of COVID-19, supply chain constraints, labor shortages, and inflation.
The discount rate assumption may be influenced by such factors as changes in interest rates and rates of inflation, which can have an impact on the determination of fair value.
For example, the significant increase in interest rates over the last fiscal year, if sustained at year-end, will significantly impact the discount rate we use in our year-end analysis, impacting the final analysis of many of our brands.
If these assumptions are adversely affected, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future.
We continuously monitor events that could trigger an interim impairment analysis, which included the impact of COVID-19, supply chain constraints, labor shortages, and inflation for the period ended December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, we determined no events have occurred that would indicate potential impairment of goodwill.
-10- 5.      Intangible Assets, net
A reconciliation of the activity affecting intangible assets, net is as follows:
(In thousands) Indefinite- Lived Trademarks Finite-Lived Trademarks and Customer Relationships Totals Gross Carrying Amounts Balance — March 31, 2022 $ 2,476,559   $ 436,174   $ 2,912,733   Effects of foreign currency exchange rates ( 7,646 ) ( 1,993 ) ( 9,639 ) Balance — December 31, 2022 2,468,913   434,181   2,903,094           Accumulated Amortization       Balance — March 31, 2022 —  216,098   216,098   Additions —  16,865   16,865   Effects of foreign currency exchange rates —  ( 197 ) ( 197 ) Balance — December 31, 2022 —  232,766   232,766   Intangible assets, net - December 31, 2022 $ 2,468,913   $ 201,415   $ 2,670,328   On July 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from Akorn (see Note 2), and on December 15, 2021, our Australian subsidiary acquired the rights to the
Zaditen
brand in certain territories from Novartis Pharma AG.
In connection with these acquisitions, we allocated $ 225.4
million to intangible assets for Akorn and $ 18.1
million for
Zaditen . Amortization expense was $ 5.6
million and $ 16.9
million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and $ 5.4
million and $ 15.6
million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.   Finite-lived intangible assets are expected to be amortized over their estimated useful life, which ranges from a period of
10
to
30
years, and the estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years and the periods thereafter is as follows (in thousands): (In thousands) Year Ending March 31, Amount 2023 (remaining three months ended March 31, 2023) $ 5,619   2024 22,434   2025 20,382   2026 18,134   2027 16,493   Thereafter 118,353   $ 201,415   Under accounting guidelines, indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but must be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below the carrying amount.
The date of our annual impairment review was February 28, 2022, and we recorded impairment charges to intangible assets of $ 0.7
million in our March 31, 2022 financial statements.
Additionally, at each reporting period, an evaluation must be made to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life.  Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and are also tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. -11- We utilize the excess earnings method to estimate the fair value of our individual indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assumptions subject to significant uncertainties include the discount rate utilized in the analyses, as well as future sales, gross margins, and advertising and marketing expenses.
The discount rate assumption may be influenced by such factors as changes in interest rates and rates of inflation, which can have an impact on the determination of fair value.
For example, the significant increase in interest rates over the last fiscal year, if sustained at year-end, will significantly impact the discount rate we use in our year-end analysis, impacting the final analysis of many of our brands.
Additionally, should the related fair values of intangible assets be adversely affected as a result of declining sales or margins caused by competition, changing consumer needs or preferences, technological advances, changes in advertising and marketing expenses, or the potential impacts of COVID-19, supply chain constraints, labor shortages, or inflation, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future.
As of December 31, 2022, no events have occurred that would indicate potential impairment of intangible assets. 6.     Leases We lease real estate and equipment for use in our operations.

For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short maturity of these amounts. -13- FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820,
Fair Value Measurements , requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market assuming an orderly transaction between market participants.
ASC 820 established market (observable inputs) as the preferred source of fair value, to be followed by our assumptions of fair value based on hypothetical transactions (unobservable inputs) in the absence of observable market inputs.
Based upon the above, the following fair value hierarchy was created: Level 1 - Quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, as well as quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not considered active; and Level 3 - Unobservable inputs developed by us using estimates and assumptions reflective of those that would be utilized by a market participant. The market values have been determined based on market values for similar instruments adjusted for certain factors.
As such, the 2021 Senior Notes, the 2019 Senior Notes, the 2012 Term B-5 Loans, and the 2012 ABL Revolver are measured in Level 2 of the above hierarchy.
The summary below details the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these instruments at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.

10.     Derivative Instruments Changes in interest rates expose us to risks.
To help us manage these risks, in January 2020 we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a total of $ 200.0
million of our variable interest debt, which settled on January 31, 2022.
We do not use derivatives for trading purposes. The following table summarizes our interest rate swaps, net of tax, for the periods shown: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) Location 2022 2021 2022 2021 Gain Recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss (effective portion) Other comprehensive income (loss) $ —   $ 561   $ —   $ 1,631   Loss Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Interest expense $ —   $ ( 735 ) $ —   $ ( 2,185 ) 11.      Stockholders' Equity We are authorized to issue
250.0
million shares of common stock, $ 0.01
par value per share, and
5.0
million shares of preferred stock, $ 0.01
par value per share.  The Board of Directors may direct the issuance of the undesignated preferred stock in one or more series and determine preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. Each share of common stock has the right to
one
vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders.  The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and when declared by the Board of Directors, subject to prior rights of holders of all classes of outstanding stock having priority rights as to dividends.   No
dividends have been declared or paid on our common stock through December 31, 2022. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we repurchased shares of our common stock and recorded them as treasury stock.
Our share repurchases consisted of the following: -14- Three Months Ended December 31,

no
amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings.
13.      Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based on income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method, which includes stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance stock units ("PSUs").
Potential common shares, composed of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and unvested RSUs, are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation to the extent that they are dilutive.
In loss periods, the assumed exercise of in-the-money stock options and RSUs has an anti-dilutive effect, and therefore these instruments are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
-15- The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: Three Months Ended December 31,

0.2
million shares and a nominal amount of shares, respectively, attributable to outstanding stock-based awards that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were
0.4
million shares and
0.1
million shares, respectively, attributable to outstanding stock-based awards that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
14.      Stock-Based Compensation In connection with our initial public offering, the Board of Directors adopted the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”), which provided for grants of up to a maximum of
5.0
million shares of restricted stock, stock options, RSUs and other equity-based awards.
In June 2014, the Board of Directors approved, and in July 2014, our stockholders ratified, an increase of an additional
1.8
million shares of our common stock for issuance under the 2005 Plan, among other changes. On June 23, 2020, the Board of Directors adopted the Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2020 Plan became effective on August 4, 2020, upon the approval of the 2020 Plan by our stockholders.
On June 23, 2020, a total of
2,827,210
shares were available for issuance under the 2020 Plan (comprised of
2,000,000
new shares plus
827,210
shares that were unissued under the 2005 Plan).
All future equity awards will be made from the 2020 Plan, and the Company will not grant any additional awards under the 2005 Plan. The following table provides information regarding our stock-based compensation: Three Months Ended December 31,

million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options under the 2005 Plan and the 2020 Plan, excluding an estimate for forfeitures which may occur.  We expect to recognize such costs over a weighted average period of
1.9
years.
At December 31, 2022, there were $ 11.4
million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested RSUs and PSUs under the 2005 Plan and the 2020 Plan, excluding an estimate for forfeitures which may occur.  We expect to recognize such costs over a weighted average period of
1.7
years.
At December 31, 2022, there were
2.2
million shares available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. On May 2, 2022, the Compensation and Talent Management Committee (the "Committee") of our Board of Directors granted
67,959
PSUs,
65,721
RSUs, and stock options to acquire
195,526
shares of our common stock under the 2020 Plan to certain executive officers and employees.
The stock options were granted at an exercise price of $ 54.47
per share, which was equal to the closing price for our common stock on the date of the grant.
Each of the independent members of the Board of Directors received a grant of
2,495
RSUs on August 2, 2022.
The RSUs fully vest
one year
after receipt of the award, subject to the continued service of the director on such vesting date, and will be settled by delivery to each director of one share of our common stock for each vested RSU either (a) at the election of the director prior to the grant date, immediately upon vesting, or (b) promptly following the earliest of (i) such director's death, (ii) such director's separation from service or (iii) a change in control of the Company. Restricted Stock Units The fair value of the RSUs is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant.

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was due to discrete items primarily pertaining to state tax rate legislative changes and stock-based compensation. 16.      Employee Retirement Plans -18- The primary components of Net Periodic Benefits consist of the following: Three Months Ended December 31,
Nine Months Ended December 31,  (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Interest cost $ 30   $ 278   $ 390   $ 834   Expected return on assets —   ( 290 ) ( 252 ) ( 870 ) Net periodic benefit expense (income) $ 30   $ ( 12 ) $ 138   $ ( 36 ) During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we contributed $ 0.3
million to our non-qualified defined benefit plan and made
no
contributions to the qualified defined benefit plan.
During the remainder of fiscal 2023, we expect to contribute an additional $ 0.1
million to our non-qualified plan and to make no contributions to the qualified plan. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we adopted a plan termination date of April 30, 2021 for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the "Plan") and began the Plan termination process.
The settlements of the terminated Plan occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with lump sum settlements in the amount of $ 13.8
million being paid to eligible Plan participants who elected such payments and the purchase of annuity contracts for $ 31.1
million to the remaining participants.
These settlements were paid using Plan assets and resulted in a settlement loss of $ 0.4
million.
No further contributions to the Plan were necessary.
17.     Commitments and Contingencies We are involved from time to time in legal matters and other claims incidental to our business.  We review outstanding claims and proceedings internally and with external counsel as necessary to assess the probability and amount of a potential loss.  These assessments are re-evaluated at each reporting period and as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted.  The actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve.  In addition, because it is not permissible under GAAP to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable, in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial, for example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement).  We believe the reasonably possible losses from resolution of routine legal matters and other claims incidental to our business, taking our reserves into account, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 18.      Concentrations of Risk Our revenues are concentrated in the area of OTC Healthcare.
We sell our products to mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience and club stores and e-commerce channels.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately
36.9 % and
38.7 %, respectively, of our gross revenues were derived from our five top selling brands.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, approximately
39.6 % and
41.7 %, respectively, of our gross revenues were derived from our five top selling brands.
One customer, Walmart, accounted for more than 10% of our gross revenues for each of the periods presented.
Walmart accounted for approximately
19.9 % and
19.8 %, respectively, of our gross revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Walmart accounted for approximately
20.2 % and
20.9 %, respectively, of our gross revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.
An additional customer, Walgreens, accounted for approximately
10.4 % of our gross revenues for the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Our product distribution in the United States is managed by a third party through one primary distribution center in Clayton, Indiana.
In addition, we operate one manufacturing facility for certain of our products located in Lynchburg, Virginia, which manufactures many of the
Summer's Eve
and
Fleet
products.
A natural disaster, such as tornado, earthquake, flood, or fire, could damage our inventory and/or materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost.
In addition, a serious disruption caused by performance or contractual issues with our third-party distribution manager or labor shortages or various public health emergencies at our distribution center or manufacturing facility could materially impact our product distribution. Any disruption could result in increased costs and/or shipping times, and could cause us to incur customer fees and penalties.
We could also incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times if we need to replace our distribution center, the third-party distribution manager or the manufacturing facility.  As a result, any serious disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2022, we had relationships with
133
third-party manufacturers.  Of those, we had long-term contracts with
27
manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately
70.5 % of gross sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
At December 31, 2021, we had relationships with
127
third-party manufacturers.  Of those, we had long-term contracts with
24
manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately
68.6 % of gross sales for the nine
-19- months ended December 31, 2021.
The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing our products at any time and for any reason or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Although we are continually in the process of negotiating long-term contracts with certain key manufacturers, we may not be able to reach a timely agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. -20- 19.     Business Segments

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.  This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties.  Future results could differ materially from the discussion that follows for many reasons, including the factors described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and in future reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). See also “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page
34
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless otherwise indicated by the context, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Prestige” refer to Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. and our subsidiaries.
Similarly, reference to a year (e.g., 2023) refers to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. General We are engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name, over-the-counter ("OTC") healthcare products to mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, and club stores and e-commerce channels in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets.  We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage. We have grown our brand portfolio both organically and through acquisitions.
We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support.
Acquisitions of OTC brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy.
We have acquired well-recognized brands from consumer products and pharmaceutical companies and private equity firms.
While many of these brands have long histories of brand development and investment, we believe that, at the time we acquired them, most were considered “non-core” by their previous owners.
As a result, these acquired brands did not benefit from adequate management focus and marketing support during the period prior to their acquisition, which created opportunities for us to reinvigorate these brands and improve their performance post-acquisition.
After adding a core brand to our portfolio, we seek to increase its sales, market share and distribution in both existing and new channels through our established retail distribution network.  We pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and marketing support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations, and innovative development of brand extensions. Acquisition Acquisition of Akorn On July 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the consumer health business assets from Akorn Operating Company LLC ("Akorn") pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated May 27, 2021 (the "Purchase Agreement"), for a purchase price of $228.9 million in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments specified in the Purchase Agreement.
As a result of the purchase, we acquired
TheraTears
and certain other over-the-counter consumer brands.
The financial results from this acquisition are included in our North American and International OTC Healthcare segments.
The purchase price was funded by a combination of available cash on hand, additional borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility entered into January 31, 2012, as amended (the "2012 ABL Revolver") and the net proceeds from the refinancing of our term loan entered into on January 31, 2012 (the "2012 Term Loan"). The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.
In connection with the acquisition, we also entered into a supply arrangement with Akorn for a term of three years with optional renewals at prevailing market rates.
We prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
The following table summarizes our allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the July 1, 2021 acquisition date. -24-
(In thousands) July 1, 2021 Inventories $ 6,455  Goodwill 1,098  Intangible assets 225,410  Total assets acquired 232,963 Accounts payable 428  Reserves for sales allowances and cash discounts 497  Other accrued liabilities 3,124  Total liabilities assumed 4,049  Total purchase price $ 228,914  Based on this analysis, we allocated $195.9 million to non-amortizable intangible assets and $29.5 million to amortizable intangible assets.
The non-amortizable intangible assets are classified as trademarks and, of the amortizable intangible assets, $20.4 million are classified as customer relationships and $9.1 million are classified as trademarks. We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 12.5 years. We recorded goodwill of $1.1 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Economic Environment
There has been economic uncertainty in the United States and globally due to several factors including global supply chain constraints, rising interest rates, a high inflationary environment, geopolitical events and the effects from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We expect economic conditions will continue to be highly volatile and uncertain, put pressure on prices and supply, and could affect demand for our products.
In fiscal 2022, we experienced solid consumer consumption and share gains across most of our brand portfolio; however, that may not be sustained at the same levels in the uncertain economic environment.
We have continued to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including a reduction in the frequency of visits to retailers and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. The volatile environment has impacted the supply of labor and raw materials and exacerbated rising input costs.
Although we have not experienced a material disruption to our overall supply chain to date, we have and may continue to experience shortages, delays and backorders for certain ingredients and products, difficulty scheduling shipping for our products, as well as price increases from many of our suppliers for both shipping and product costs. In addition, labor shortages have impacted our manufacturing operations and may impact our ability to supply certain products to our customers. To date, the pandemic and other global conditions have not had a material negative impact on our operations, supply chain, overall costs or demand for most of our products or resulting aggregate sales and earnings, and, as such, it has also not negatively impacted our liquidity position.
We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs.
These circumstances could change, however, in this dynamic, unprecedented environment.
If conditions cause further disruption in the global supply chain, the availability of labor and materials or otherwise increase costs, it may materially affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including causing disruptions in the supply and distribution of our products. The extent to which these conditions impact our results and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and duration of any further COVID-19 outbreaks, global supply chain constraints, the high inflationary environment and further global instability. These effects could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations and those of the third parties on which we rely. -25- Results of Operations

North American OTC Healthcare Segment Revenues for the North American OTC Healthcare segment decreased $4.0 million, or 1.6%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 versus the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The $4.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales in the Women's Health and Eye & Ear categories, partially offset by an increase in sales in the Cough & Cold and Gastrointestinal categories. International OTC Healthcare Segment Revenues for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $5.0 million, or 15.0%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 versus the three months ended December 31, 2021. The $5.0 million increase was mainly attributable to increased consumer demand across the segment's key brands, largely as a result of easing COVID-19 restrictions, as well as an increase in consumer illnesses.

The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily a result of increased supply chain costs and product mix.
North American OTC Healthcare Segment Gross profit for the North American OTC Healthcare segment decreased $7.7 million, or 5.8%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 versus the three months ended December 31, 2021.
As a percentage of North American OTC Healthcare revenues, gross profit decreased to 53.3% during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 55.7% during the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased supply chain costs and product mix, partly offset by pricing actions. International OTC Healthcare Segment Gross profit for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $3.1 million, or 14.7%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 versus the three months ended December 31, 2021.
As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, gross profit decreased slightly to 62.3% during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 62.5% during the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased supply chain costs, partly offset by product mix. Contribution Margin Contribution margin is our segment measure of profitability.
It is defined as gross profit less advertising and marketing expenses. The following table presents our contribution margin and contribution margin as a percentage of total segment revenues, by segment for each of the periods presented. Three Months Ended December 31,
(In thousands) Increase (Decrease) Contribution Margin 2022 % 2021 % Amount % North American OTC Healthcare $ 101,499  42.8  $ 99,160  41.2  $ 2,339  2.4  International OTC Healthcare 18,480  47.8  15,661  46.6  2,819  18.0    $ 119,979  43.5  $ 114,821  41.8  $ 5,158  4.5  North American OTC Healthcare Segment Contribution margin for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $2.3 million, or 2.4%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 versus the three months ended December 31, 2021.
As a percentage of North American OTC Healthcare revenues, contribution margin increased to 42.8% during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 41.2% during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The contribution margin increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing spend in the three months ended December 31, 2022, partly offset by the decrease in gross profit discussed above. -27- International OTC Healthcare Segment Contribution margin for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $2.8 million, or 18.0%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 versus the three months ended December 31, 2021.
As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, contribution margin increased to 47.8% during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 46.6% during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The contribution margin increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing spend as a percent of net sales. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were $26.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $26.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased compensation costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and acquisition costs incurred in the prior period associated with the Akorn acquisition. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses remained relatively flat at $6.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $6.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $17.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 versus $16.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The average indebtedness decreased to $1.4 billion during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $1.6 billion during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The average cost of borrowing increased to 5.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from 4.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $16.2 million versus $15.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The effective tax rate during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 23.7% versus 23.3% during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to the impact of discrete items primarily pertaining to stock-based compensation. -28- Results of Operations

North American OTC Healthcare Segment Revenues for the North American OTC Healthcare segment decreased $3.5 million, or 0.5%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 versus the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The $3.5 million decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales in the Women's Health category, partially offset by an increase in sales in the Cough & Cold category.
International OTC Healthcare Segment Revenues for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $25.5 million, or 30.0%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 versus the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The $25.5 million increase was mainly attributable to increased sales in our Australian business of the
Hydralyte
brand (included in the Gastrointestinal category) as a result of easing COVID-19 restrictions, as well as an increase in consumer illnesses.
-29- Gross Profit The following table presents our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total segment revenues, by segment for each of the periods presented. Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) Increase (Decrease) Gross Profit
2022 % 2021 % Amount % North American OTC Healthcare

North American OTC Healthcare Segment Gross profit for the North American OTC Healthcare segment decreased $15.7 million, or 3.7%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 versus the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
As a percentage of North American OTC Healthcare revenues, gross profit decreased to 55.3% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from 57.2% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased supply chain costs and product mix, partly offset by pricing actions. International OTC Healthcare Segment Gross profit for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $15.5 million, or 29.9%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 versus the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, gross profit remained flat at 60.8% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Increases in supply chain costs were mainly offset by product mix. Contribution Margin Contribution margin is our segment measure of profitability.
It is defined as gross profit less advertising and marketing expenses. The following table presents our contribution margin and contribution margin as a percentage of total segment revenues, by segment for each of the periods presented. Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) Increase (Decrease) Contribution Margin 2022 % 2021 % Amount % North American OTC Healthcare $ 304,889  41.7  $ 313,531  42.7  $ (8,642) (2.8) International OTC Healthcare 52,448  47.5  37,845  44.6  14,603  38.6    $ 357,337  42.4  $ 351,376  42.9  $ 5,961  1.7
North American OTC Healthcare Segment Contribution margin for the North American OTC Healthcare segment decreased $8.6 million, or 2.8%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 versus the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
As a percentage of North American OTC Healthcare revenues, contribution margin decreased to 41.7% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from 42.7% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The contribution margin decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit margin noted above, partly offset by a decrease in advertising and marketing spend in the nine months ended December 31, 2022. International OTC Healthcare Segment Contribution margin for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $14.6 million, or 38.6%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 versus the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, contribution margin increased to 47.5% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from 44.6% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The contribution margin increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing spend as a percent of net sales. -30- General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were $79.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and $80.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisition costs in the prior period associated with the Akorn acquisition, partially offset by increases in compensation costs in the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses were $19.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and $18.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses was attributable to an increase in amortization expense due to the addition of certain brands purchased in conjunction with our 2022 acquisitions. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $50.2 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 versus $48.3 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The average indebtedness decreased to $1.5 billion during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from $1.6 billion during the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The average cost of borrowing increased to 4.5% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 4.1% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million related to the amendment of our 2012 Term Loan on July 1, 2021. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $47.4 million versus $48.2 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2021.  The effective tax rate during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was 23.0% versus 23.9% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was due to the impact of discrete items primarily pertaining to state tax rate legislative changes and stock-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Our primary source of cash comes from our cash flow from operations.
In the past, we have supplemented this source of cash with various debt facilities, primarily in connection with acquisitions.
We have financed our operations, and expect to continue to finance our operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, with a combination of funds generated from operations and borrowings.  Our principal uses of cash are for operating expenses, debt service, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and acquisitions.
Based on our current levels of operations and anticipated growth, excluding acquisitions, we believe that our cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities will be adequate to finance our working capital and capital expenditures through the next twelve months.
See "Economic Environment" above. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $86.4 million, an increase of $59.2 million from March 31, 2022.
The following table summarizes the change:
Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 $ Change Cash provided by (used in):   Operating Activities $ 170,729  $ 196,796  $ (26,067) Investing Activities (5,226)   (253,218) 247,992  Financing Activities (105,351)   46,546  (151,897) Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (979) (1,408) 429  Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 59,173  $ (11,284) $ 70,457  Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $170.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $196.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The $26.1 million decrease was due to increased working capital, partly offset by an increase in net income before non-cash items.
Investing Activities
-31- Net cash used in investing activities was $5.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $253.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of Akorn assets in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $105.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $46.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to lower net borrowings of $107.0 million, and the repurchase of shares of our common stock in conjunction with our share repurchase program of $50.0 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of $1.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness, which consisted of the following: • $400.0 million of 5.125% 2019 senior unsecured notes, which mature on January 15, 2028 (the "2019 Senior Notes"); • $600.0 million of 3.750% 2021 senior unsecured notes, which mature on April 1, 2031 (the "2021 Senior Notes"); and • $440.0 million of borrowings under the 2012 Term B-5 Loans due July 1, 2028. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance on our 2012 ABL Revolver and a borrowing capacity of $155.3 million.
During the year ended March 31, 2022, we made required repayments of $1.5 million as well as voluntary principal payments of $103.5 million against the outstanding balance under our 2012 Term Loan.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we made voluntary principal repayments of $55.0 million against the outstanding balance under our 2012 Term Loan.
Since we have made optional payments that exceed all of our required quarterly payments, we will not be required to make another payment on the 2012 Term Loan until maturity. Maturities: (In thousands) Year Ending March 31, Amount 2023 (remaining three months ending March 31, 2023) $ —  2024 —  2025 —  2026 —  2027 —  Thereafter 1,440,000  $ 1,440,000  Covenants: Our debt facilities contain various financial covenants, including provisions that require us to maintain certain leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge ratios.  The credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and the 2012 ABL Revolver and the indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and 2019 Senior Notes contain provisions that accelerate our indebtedness on certain changes in control and restrict us from undertaking specified corporate actions, including asset dispositions, acquisitions, payments of dividends and other specified payments, repurchasing our equity securities in the public markets, incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens, making loans and investments and transactions with affiliates. Specifically, we must: • Have a leverage ratio of less than 6.50 to 1.0 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and thereafter (defined as, with certain adjustments, the ratio of our consolidated total net debt as of the last day of the fiscal quarter to our trailing twelve month consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and certain other items (“EBITDA”)); • Have an interest coverage ratio of greater than 2.25 to 1.0 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and thereafter (defined as, with certain adjustments, the ratio of our consolidated EBITDA to our trailing twelve month consolidated cash interest expense); and -32- • Have a fixed charge ratio of greater than 1.0 to 1.0 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 (defined as, with certain adjustments, the ratio of our consolidated EBITDA minus capital expenditures to our trailing twelve month consolidated interest paid, taxes paid and other specified payments).
Our fixed charge requirement remains level throughout the term of the debt facilities. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the applicable financial and restrictive covenants under the 2012 Term Loan and the 2012 ABL Revolver and the indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2019 Senior Notes.
Management anticipates that in the normal course of operations, we will be in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants during the next twelve months.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from those estimates.  A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.  There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.

For more information, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. -35- ITEM 3.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates because our 2012 Term Loan and 2012 ABL Revolver are variable rate debt.
At December 31, 2022, approximately $440.0 million of our debt carries a variable rate of interest. Holding other variables constant, including levels of indebtedness, a 1.0% increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have an adverse impact on pre-tax earnings and cash flows for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $1.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately 14.9% and 13.8%, respectively, of our gross revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, approximately 14.2% and 12.8%, respectively, of our gross revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
As such, we are exposed to transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates.
These transactions are primarily with respect to the Canadian and Australian Dollars.
We performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to exchange rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Holding all other variables constant, and assuming a hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates, this analysis resulted in a less than 5.0% impact on pre-tax income of approximately $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and approximately $7.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
It represented a less than 5.0% impact on pre-tax income of approximately $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and approximately $5.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
ITEM 4.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a–15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2022.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II.      OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K have not materially changed in the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, but such risks are not the only risks facing us.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our quarterly operating results and revenues may fluctuate as a result of any of these or other factors.
Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and revenues for
-36- any particular future period may decrease.  In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors.  In that event, the market price of our outstanding securities could be adversely impacted.
