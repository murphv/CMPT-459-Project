NOTES TO CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION
Green Giant Inc. (“GGE”
or the “Company” or “we”, “us”, “our”), through its subsidiaries and variable interest
entity (“VIE”), engages in real estate development, and the construction and sales of residential apartments, parking spaces
and commercial properties in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties in China. On March 23, 2022, the Company completed the change of its
name from China HGS Real Estate Inc. to Green Giant Inc., effective immediately (the “Name Change”).
The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 13, 2023.
Liquidity
In recent years, the
Chinese government has implemented measures to control overheating residential and commercial property prices including but not limited
to restrictions on home purchases, increasing the down-payment requirement against speculative buying, development of low-cost rental
housing properties to help low-income groups while reducing the demand in the commercial housing market, increasing real estate property
taxes to discourage speculation, control of the land supply and slowdown the construction land auction process, etc. In addition, in December
2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced. COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout China and worldwide, which has caused
significant volatility in the PRC and international markets. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business
disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the PRC’s and international economies. To reduce the spread of COVID-19,
the Chinese government has employed measures including city lockdowns, quarantines, travel restrictions, suspension of business activities
and school closures. Due to difficulties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, the temporary closure of
the Company’s facilities and operations beginning in early February through early March 2020, limited support from the Company’s
employees, delayed access to construction raw material supplies, reduced customer visits to the Company’s sales office, and inability
to promote real estate property sales to customers on a timely basis. The Company had real estate sales of approximately $ 0.2  million
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $ 2.9  million in the same period of last year. Due to the negative
impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and its spread, the development period of real estate properties and our operating cycle has been extended
and we may not be able to liquidate our large balance of completed real estate properties within the short term as we originally expected.
In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had large construction loans payable of approximately $ 111.8  million and accounts payable
of approximately $ 10.9  million due to subcontractors.
Resurgence of COVID-19
and followed lock-down policies in some cities of PRC might cut the Company’s demand and revenue depending on length of lock-down.
Starting  on March 27, 2022, Shanghai city implements the lockdown policy, which did not have significant negative impact on the
Company’s operation because the Company has no operation in Shanghai. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s
future financial results will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, the potential resurgence
of the crisis, future government actions in response to the crisis and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the local economy
and real estate markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. Given this uncertainty, the
Company is currently unable to quantify the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its future operations, financial condition, liquidity
and results of operations if the current situation continues. The above-mentioned facts raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of this filing.

NOTE 2. LIQUIDITY
In assessing its liquidity,
management monitors and analyzes the Company’s cash on-hand, its ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future, and
its operating and capital expenditure commitments. As of December 31, 2022, our total cash and restricted cash balance was approximately
$ 3.8  million.
With respect to capital
funding requirements, the Company budgeted its capital spending based on ongoing assessments of its needs to maintain adequate cash. On
October 25, 2022, the Company closed a private placement with gross proceeds of $ 5.2  million. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately
$ 77  million of completed residential apartments and commercial units available for sale to potential buyers. Although we reported
approximately $ 10.9  million accounts payable as of December 31, 2022 due to the long-term relationship with our construction suppliers
and subcontractors, we were able to effectively manage cash spending on construction and negotiate with them to adjust the payment schedule
based on our cash on hand. In addition, most of our existing real estate development projects relate to the old town renovation which
are supported by the local government. As of December 31, 2022, we reported approximately $ 111.8  million of construction loans borrowed
from financial institutions controlled by the local government and such loans can only be used on the old town renovation related project
development. We expect that we will be able to renew all of the existing construction loans upon their maturity and borrow additional
new loans from local financial institutions, when necessary, based on our past experience and the Company’s good credit history.
Also, the Company’s cash flows from pre-sales and current sales should provide financial support for our current development projects
and operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had  six  large ongoing construction projects (see Note 4, real
estate properties under development) which were under the preliminary development stage due to delayed inspection and acceptance of the
development plans by the local government. In June 2020, we completed the residence relocation surrounding the Liangzhou Road related
projects and launched the construction of these projects in December 2020. For the other four projects, we expect we will be able to obtain
the government’s approval of the development plans on these projects in the coming fiscal year and start the pre-sale of the real
estate properties to generate cash when certain property development milestones have been achieved.
NOTE 3.  SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The interim unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States (“US GAAP”).
The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial information as of December 31, 2022 and for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 has been prepared
without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and pursuant to Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures,
which are normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP, have been omitted pursuant to those rules
and regulations. The unaudited interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the
notes thereto, included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on January 13, 2023.
In the opinion of the
management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments, which are
necessary for a fair presentation of financial results for the interim periods presented. The Company believes that the disclosures are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared using the same accounting policies as used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for
the year ended September 30, 2021. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the full years.
Principles of consolidation
The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, China HGS Investment Inc. (“HGS Investment”),
Shaanxi HGS Management and Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Shaanxi HGS”) and its variable interest entity (“VIE”), Shaanxi
Guangsha Investment and Development Group Co., Ltd. (“Guangsha”). All inter-company transactions and balances between the
Company and its subsidiaries and VIE have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the assumptions and estimates used by management in recognizing development revenue
under the percentage of completion method, the selection of the useful lives of property and equipment, provision necessary for contingent
liabilities, revenue recognition, taxes and budgeted costs. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing its consolidated
financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

REAL ESTATE, INC.)
NOTES TO UNAUDITED
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company follows the
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic
820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” It clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring
fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market
data.
Level 3-Inputs are unobservable
inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions or what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability based on the best available information.
The carrying amounts
reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for cash, restricted cash and all other current assets, security deposits for
land use rights, loans and all current liabilities approximate their fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of the customer, construction and security deposits approximate their carrying amounts because the deposits are received
in cash. It was impractical to estimate the fair value of the amount due from the local government and the other payables.
Revenue recognition
The Company follows FASB
ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized in accordance
with the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled
to for those goods and services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
● identification
of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
● identification
of the performance obligations in the contract;
● determination
of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
● allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
● recognition
of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Most of the Company’s
revenue is derived from real estate sales of condominiums and commercial properties in the PRC. The majority of the Company’s contracts
contain a single performance obligation involving significant real estate development activities that are performed together to deliver
a real estate property to its customers. Revenues arising from real estate sales are recognized when or as the control of the asset is
transferred to the customer. The control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. For the sales of individual condominium
units in a real estate development project, the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue
is recognized over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation (“percentage completion
method”). Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset. For the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any construction in progress recognized under the percentage of completion
method. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, all revenues were generated from completed condominium real estate projects.

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Revenue recognition (continued)
Contract balances
Timing of revenue recognition
may differ from the timing of billing and cash receipts from customers. The Company records a contract asset when revenue is recognized
prior to invoicing, or a contract liability when cash is received in advance of recognizing revenue. A contract asset is a right to consideration
that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Contract assets include billed and billable receivables, which are the
Company’s unconditional rights to consideration other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities include cash collected in advance
and in excess of revenue recognized. Customer deposits are excluded from contract liabilities.
The Company immediately
expenses sales commissions (included under selling expenses) because sales commission are not expected to be recovered.
The Company provides
“mortgage loan guarantees” only with respect to buyers who make down-payments of  20 %- 50 % of the total purchase price
of the property. The period of the mortgage loan guarantee begins on the date the bank approves the buyer’s mortgage and we receive
the loan proceeds in our bank account and ends on the date the “Certificate of Ownership” evidencing that title to the property
has been transferred to the buyer. The procedures to obtain the Certificate of Ownership take six to twelve months (the
“Mortgage Loan Guarantee Period”). If, after investigation of the buyer’s income and other relevant factors, the bank
decides not to grant the mortgage loan, our mortgage-loan based sales contract terminates and there will be no guarantee obligation. If,
during the Mortgage Loan Guarantee Period, the buyer defaults on his or her monthly mortgage payment for three consecutive months,
we are required to return the loan proceeds back to the bank, although we have the right to keep the customer’s deposit and resell
the property to a third party. Once the Certificate of Ownership has been issued by the relevant government authority, our loan guarantee
terminates. If the buyer then defaults on his or her mortgage loan, the bank has the right to take the property back and sell it and use
the proceeds to pay off the loan. The Company is not liable for any shortfall that the bank may incur in this event. To date, no buyer
has defaulted on his or her mortgage payments during the Mortgage Loan Guarantee Period and the Company has not returned any loan proceeds
pursuant to its mortgage loan guarantees.

Real estate property development completed
and under development
Real estate property
consists of finished residential unit sites, commercial offices and residential unit sites under development. The Company leases the land
for the residential unit sites under land use right leases with various terms from the PRC government. The cost of land use rights is
included in the development cost and allocated to each project. Real estate property development completed and real estate property under
development are stated at the lower of cost or fair value.
Expenditures for land
development, including cost of land use rights, deed tax, pre-development costs, and engineering costs, exclusive of depreciation, are
capitalized and allocated to development projects by the specific identification method. Costs are allocated to specific units within
a project based on the ratio of the sales area of units to the estimated total sales area of the project (or phase of the project) multiplied
by the total cost of the project (or phase of the project).
Cost of amenities transferred
to buyers is allocated to specific units as a component of total construction cost. The amenity cost includes landscaping, road paving,
etc. Once the projects are completed, the amenities are under control of the property management companies.
Real estate property
development completed and under development are subject to valuation adjustments when the carrying amount exceeds fair value. An impairment
loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. The Company reviews all of its
real estate projects for future losses and impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for each project to the
carrying value of such project. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not recognize any impairment loss
for its real estate properties.

Capitalization of Interest
Interest incurred during
and directly related to real estate development projects is capitalized to the related real estate property under development during the
active development period, which generally commences when borrowings are used to acquire real estate assets and ends when the properties
are substantially complete or the property becomes inactive. Interest is capitalized based on the interest rate applicable to specific
borrowings or the weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings during the period. Interest capitalized to real estate
properties under development is recorded as a component of the cost of real estate sales when related units are sold. All other interest
is expensed as incurred. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total interest capitalized for real estate property
development was $ 1,442,425
and $ 1,733,224 , respectively.
Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company reviews its
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever
any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
Assets are grouped and
evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
The Company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares
the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount
of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of impairment by comparing
the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The estimation of fair value is generally determined by using the asset’s expected
future discounted cash flows or market value. The Company estimates fair value of the assets based on certain assumptions such as budgets,
internal projections, and other available information as considered necessary. There was no impairment of long-lived assets
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Income taxes
In accordance with FASB
ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” deferred tax assets and liabilities are for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end
based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
A valuation allowances is established, when necessary, to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
ASC 740-10-25 prescribes
a more-likely-than-not threshold for consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax positions taken (or expected
to be taken) in a tax return. It also provides guidance on the recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current
and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, years open for tax
examination, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures. There are no material uncertain tax positions
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021.
The Company is a corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Florida. However, all of the Company’s operations are conducted solely by its subsidiaries
and VIE in the PRC. No income is earned in the United States and the management does not repatriate any earnings outside the PRC. As a
result, the Company did not generate any U.S. taxable income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31,
2022, the Chinese entities’ income tax returns filed in China for the years ended December 31, 2016 through 2022 are subject to
examination by the Chinese taxing authorities.
The parent Company, Green
Giant’s both U.S. federal tax returns and Florida state tax returns are delinquent since 2009. Its tax years ended September 30,
2009 through September 30, 2022 remain open for statutory examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
On December 22, 2017,
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
Changes include, but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from  35 % to  21 % effective for tax years
beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system,
and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Due to the
complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded accrued amounts
in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, including approximately $ 2.3  million
provision on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and an additional $ 1.3  million provision for delinquent
U.S. and State tax fillings. The Company plans to engage a tax professional to file its delinquent tax returns in 2023. Failure to furnish
any income tax and information returns with respect to any foreign business entity required, within the time prescribed by the IRS, subjects
the Company to civil penalties.

Land appreciation tax (“LAT”)
In accordance with the
relevant taxation laws in the PRC, the Company is subject to LAT based on progressive rates on the appreciation of land value, which is
calculated as the proceeds of sales of properties less deductible expenditures including borrowing costs and all property development
expenditures. LAT is exempted if the appreciation values do not exceed certain thresholds specified in the relevant tax laws.
The whole project must
be completed before the LAT obligation can be assessed. Accordingly, the Company records the liability and the total related expense at
the completion of a project unless the tax authorities impose an assessment at an earlier date. The methods to implement this tax law
vary among different geographic areas. Hanzhong, where the projects Mingzhu Garden, Nan Dajie and Central Plaza are located, implements
this tax rule by requiring real estate companies prepay the LAT based upon customer deposits received. The tax rate in Hanzhong is  1 %.
Yang County, where the Yangzhou Pearl Garden and Yangzhou Palace projects are located, has a tax rate of  0.5 %.
Comprehensive income (loss)
In accordance with ASC
220-10-55, comprehensive income (loss) is defined as all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions
to owners. The Company’s only components of other comprehensive income (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
were net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.
Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share
The Company computes
earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) in accordance with the ASC 260, “Earnings per share”, which requires companies
to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income (loss) divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g.,
convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date,
if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share)
are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.
On December 10, 2021,
the Company entered into a certain securities purchase agreement with certain purchasers whom are “non-U.S. Persons” as defined
in Regulation S of the Securities Act, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of  10,247,122  units , each
Unit consisting of  one  share of common stock, par value $ 0.001  per share and a warrant to purchase  three  shares
of Common Stock with an initial exercise price of $ 2.375  at a price of $ 2.375  per Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$ 24.3  million. The Warrants are exercisable at any time after the six-month anniversary of the issuance date at an initial exercise
price of $ 2.375  for cash. The Warrants may also be exercised cashlessly if at any time after the six-month anniversary of the issuance
date, there is no effective registration statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the Warrant Shares.
The Warrants shall expire five and a half years from its date of issuance. The Warrants are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions
reflecting stock dividends and splits or other similar transactions.

Concentration risk
The Company’s operations
are carried out in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced
by the political, economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC’s economy. The Company’s
operations in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America.
The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
measures, currency conversion and remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. Financial instruments which
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. The Company’s
cash and restricted cash were on deposit at financial institutions in the PRC, which the management believes are of high credit quality.
In May, 2015, China’s new Deposit Insurance Regulation came into effect, pursuant to which banking financial institutions, such
as commercial banks, established in China are required to purchase deposit insurance for deposits in RMB and in foreign currencies placed
with them. Such Deposit Insurance Regulation would not be effective in providing complete protection for the Company’s accounts,
as its aggregate deposits are much higher than the compensation limit of RMB 500,000  (approximately $ 74,600 ). However, the Company
believes that the risk of failure of any of these Chinese banks is remote. Bank failure is uncommon in China and the Company believes
that the Chinese banks that hold the Company’s cash and restricted cash are financially sound based on public available information.
The Company has not experienced any losses in its bank accounts.
For the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any individual customer that accounted for more than
10 % of the Company real
estate sales revenue for the related periods.
Recently issued accounting
standards
The Company considers the applicability
and impact of all ASUs. Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial
Instruments-Credit Losses
(Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at
the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing
incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13

other entities, this guidance and its amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. As a smaller reporting company, the Company plans to adopt this guidance effective October 1, 2023.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12,
Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate,

In September 2013, the Company entered into an agreement (“Liangzhou Agreement”) with the Hanzhong local government on the Liangzhou Road reformation and expansion project (Liangzhou Road Project”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is contracted to reform and expand the Liangzhou Road, a commercial street in downtown Hanzhong City, with a total length of 2,080 meters and a width of 30 meters and to resettle the existing residences in the Liangzhou road area. The government’s original road construction budget was approximately $ 33  million in accordance with the Liangzhou Agreement. The Company, in return, is being compensated by the local government to have an exclusive right on acquiring at least  394.5   Mu land use rights in a specified location of Hanzhong City. The  Liangzhou Road Project’s road construction started at the end of 2013. In 2014, the original scope and budget on the Liangzhou road reformation and expansion project was extended, because the local government included more area and resettlement residences into the project, which resulted in additional investments from the Company. In return, the Company is authorized by the local government to develop and manage the commercial and residential properties surrounding the Liangzhou Road project. The Company launched the construction of the Liangzhou Road related projects in December 2020. As of December 31, 2022, the main Liangzhou road construction is substantially completed.
The Company’s
development cost incurred for the Liangzhou Road Project is treated as the Company’s deposit on purchasing the related land use
rights, as agreed by the local government. As of  December 31, 2022 , the actual costs
incurred by the Company were  approximately  $ 179.7   million
( September 30, 2022 - $ 173.3   million)  and the incremental cost
related to residence resettlements approved by the local government. The Company determined that the Company’s Investment in the
Liangzhou Road Project in exchange for interests in future land use rights is a barter transaction with commercial substance.
(b)
In September 2012, the Company was approved by the Hanzhong local government to construct four municipal roads with a total length of approximately 1,192 meters. The project was deferred and then restarted during the quarter ended June 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2022, the local government has not completed the budget for these projects therefore the delivery for these projects for the government’s acceptance and related settlement were extended to 2023.
(c)
The Company was engaged by the Yang County local government to construct the East 2nd Ring Road with a total length of 2.15 km. The local government is required to repay the Company’s project investment costs within 3 years with interest at the interest rate based on the commercial borrowing rate with the similar term published by the China Construction Bank (December 31, 2022 and 2021 –  4.75 )%. The local government has approved a refund to the Company by reducing local surcharges or taxes otherwise required in the real estate development. The road construction was substantially completed as of December 31, 2022 and is in process of the government’s review and approval.

On June 26, 2015 and March 10, 2016, the Company signed phase I and Phase II agreements with Hanzhong Urban Construction Investment Development Co., Ltd, a state-owned Company, to borrow up to approximately $ 112.4  million (RMB 775
million) for a long term loan with interest at  4.75 % to develop the Liangzhou Road Project. As of  December 31, 2022 , the Company borrowed $ 94.6
million under this credit line  (September 30,  2022  - $ 91.7
million ).  Due to the local government’s delay in the relocation  of residences in the Liangzhou Road Project and related area, the Hanzhong Urban Construction Investment Development Co., Ltd has not released all the funds available to the Company and additional withdrawals will be based on the project’s development progress and the Company expects the loan will be extended upon maturity. The loan is guaranteed by Hanzhong City Hantai District Municipal Government and pledged by the Company’s Yang County Yangzhou Palace project with a carrying value of $ 35.6
million as of December 31, 2022 (September 30, 2022- $ 34.6
million). For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the interest was $ 0.86

The interest is 1.2% and due on June 20, 2031.
The Company is required to repay the loan in equal annual principal repayments of approximately $ 3.3  million commencing from December 2027 through June 2031 with interest payable on an annual basis. The Company pledged the assets of the Liangzhou Road related projects with a carrying value of $ 179.7
million as collateral for the loan. Total interest of $ 0.05
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was capitalized into the development cost of the Hanzhong City Liangzhou Road Project (December 31, 2021- $ 0.06

Additionally,
in September 2017, the Urban Development Center Co., Ltd. approved a construction loan for the Company in the amount of approximately
$ 25.4
million (RMB 175

2022. Interest charges for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 0.07
million and $ 0.08
million, respectively, which
was included in the construction capitalized costs.

NOTE 8. TAXES
(A) Business
sales tax and VAT
The Company is subject
to a  5 % VAT for its existing real estate projects based on the local tax authority’s practice. As of December  31 ,
2022, the Company had business VAT tax payable of $ 4.13
million (September 30, 2022 - $ 4.14
million ), which is expected to be paid when the projects are completed and assessed by the local tax authority.
B) Corporate income taxes (“CIT”)
The Company’s PRC
subsidiary and VIE are governed by the Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China for privately run enterprises, which are
generally subject to income tax on income reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriate tax adjustments. The Company’s
CIT rate is  25 % on taxable income. Although the possibility exists for reinterpretation of the application of the tax regulations
by higher tax authorities in the PRC, potentially overturning the decision made by the local tax authority, the Company has not experienced
any reevaluation of the income taxes for prior years. The PRC tax rules are different from the local tax rules and the
Company is required to comply with local tax rules. The difference between the two tax rules will not be a liability of the Company.
There will be no further tax payments for the difference. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company’s total
income tax payable amounted to $ 13,550,798  and $ 13,279,845 , respectively, which included the income tax payable balances in the PRC
of $ 9,985,799  and $ 9,714,844 , respectively and the Company expects to pay this income tax payable balance when the related real estate
projects are completely sold.

Recent U.S. federal tax
legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform”), was signed into law on December 22,
2017. The U.S. Tax Reform significantly modified the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, reducing the statutory U.S. federal
corporate income tax rate from  35 % to  21 % for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; limiting and/or eliminating
many business deductions; migrating the U.S. to a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation
of previously deferred foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; subject to certain limitations, generally eliminating U.S. corporate
income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and providing for new taxes on certain foreign earnings. Taxpayers may elect to pay
the one-time transition tax over eight years or in a single lump sum. The U.S. Tax Reform also includes provisions for a new tax
on  Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“ GILTI”) effective for tax years
of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2017. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed
return on tangible assets of controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”), subject to the possible use of foreign tax credits
and a deduction equal to  50  percent to offset the income tax liability, subject to some limitations. As of  December
31 , 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company assessed that the related GILTI tax payable was
Nil , which is subject to the reassessment
upon the Company’s filling of GILTI information.
For the year ended September 30,
2018, the Company recognized a one-time transition toll tax of approximately $ 2.3  million that represented management’s estimate
of the amount of U.S. corporate income tax based on the deemed repatriation to the United States of the Company’s share of previously
deferred earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and VIE of the Company mandated by the U.S. Tax Reform. The Company’s estimate
of the onetime transition toll Tax is subject to the finalization of management’s analysis related to certain matters, such as developing
interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain foreign VIEs and the filing
of our tax returns. U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the Tax Act may require
further adjustments and changes in our estimates. As of  December 31 , 2022 and September
30, 2022, the Company provided
nil
additional provision due to delinquent U.S. tax return fillings.

Since January 1,

provided for the sales of ordinary residential properties if the appreciation values do not exceed certain thresholds specified in the
relevant tax laws. However, the Company’s local tax authority in Hanzhong City has not imposed the regulation on real estate companies
in its area of administration. Instead, the local tax authority has levied the LAT at the rate of  0.5 % in Yang County and  1.0 %
in Hanzhong against total cash receipts from sales of real estate properties, rather than according to the progressive rates.

NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
From time to time, the
Company is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues costs related to these matters
when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s management does not believe the liability from
the disposition of such claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
As
an industry practice, the Company provides guarantees to PRC banks with respect to loans procured by the purchasers of the
Company’s real estate properties for the total mortgage loan amount until the buyer obtains the “Certificate of
Ownership” of the properties from the government, which generally takes six to twelve months. Because the banks provide loan
proceeds without getting the “Certificate of Ownership” as loan collateral during the six-to-twelve-month period, the
mortgage banks require the Company to maintain, as restricted cash of at least  5 % of the mortgage proceeds as security for the
Company’s obligations under such guarantees. If a purchaser defaults on its payment obligations, the mortgage bank may deduct
the delinquent mortgage payment from the security deposit and require the Company to pay the excess amount if the delinquent
mortgage payments exceed the security deposit. If the delinquent mortgage payments exceed the security deposit, the banks may
require us to pay the excess amount. If multiple purchasers’ default on their payment obligations at around the same time, we
will be required to make significant payments to the banks to satisfy our guarantee obligations. If we are unable to resell the
properties underlying defaulted mortgages on a timely basis or at prices higher than the amounts of our guarantees and related
expenses, we will suffer financial losses. The Company has the required reserves in its restricted cash account to cover any
potential mortgage defaults as required by the mortgage lenders. Since inception through the release of this report, the Company has
not experienced any delinquent mortgage loans and has not experienced any losses related to these guarantees.
As of December
31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, our outstanding guarantees in respect of our customers’ mortgage loans amounted to
approximately $ 25.7
million and
24.9
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the amount of restricted
cash reserved for these guarantees was approximately $ 2.9
million and $ 3.0
million, respectively, and the Company believes that
such reserves are sufficient.
The Company has been named as a defendant in a
number of lawsuits arising in its ordinary course of business. As of the date of this quarterly report, the Company continues to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to defend itself in these proceedings and is undergoing on-going discussion with regulatory authorities.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition reported in the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements of Green Giant Inc. (formerly “China HGS Real Estate, Inc.”) for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in
this report.
As used in this report,
the terms “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “GGE” refer to Green Giant Inc.
and its subsidiaries.
Preliminary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements.
We make forward-looking
statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report
based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements include
information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “Business Overview,”
“Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and other statements throughout this report preceded by, followed by or that include the
words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates”
or similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements
are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these
forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our
periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We therefore caution you not to rely unduly
on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake
no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements relating to:
● our
ability to sustain our project development
● our
ability to obtain additional land use rights at favorable prices;
● the
market for real estate in Tier 3 and 4 cities and counties;
● our
ability to obtain additional capital in future years to fund our planned expansion; or
● economic
political, regulatory, legal and foreign exchange risks associated with our operations.
Business Overview
We conduct substantially
all of our business through Shaanxi Guangsha Investment and Development Group Co., Ltd, in Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province. Since the initiation
of our business, we have been focused on expanding our business in certain Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties in China.
For the three months
ended December 31, 2022, our sales and gross profit were $0.2 million and $0.03 million, respectively, representing an approximate 94.2%
and 97.6% decrease in sales and gross profit as compared to three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease in sales
and gross profit was mainly the result of less gross floor area (“GFA”) sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
the average selling price (“ASP”) for our real estate projects located in Yang County was approximately $482 per square meter,
decreased $31 per square comparing to the same period of last year due to lower ASP.

Market Outlook
On November 11, 2022, the People’s Bank
of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission issued “Yin Fa [2022] No. 254 “Notice on Supporting the
Stable and Healthy Development of the Real Estate Market” to support the stable and healthy development of the real estate market.
On November 14, 2022, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the Central
Bank issued the “Notice on the Relevant Work of Commercial Banks Issuing letters of Guarantee to Replace the Pre-sale Supervision
Funds” (the “Pre-sale Supervision Funds Notice”). Commercial banks’ house related credit business is expected
to expand. The “Financial Support for Real Estate Notice” issued sixteen measures to generate power at both supply and demand
ends, it further clarifies the support policies for housing credit. Many policies have been implemented at the document system level for
the first time, or will push banks to increase their support for the real estate market. It is expected to positively affect the conservative
attitude of commercial banks to intervene in the development of loan market and support the increasing demand from home buyers for mortagage
loans.
The Company intends to remain focused on our existing
construction projects in Hanzhong City and Yang County, deepening our institutional sales network, enhancing our cost and operational
synergies and improving cash flows and strengthening our balance sheet.
The Company started the construction of the Liangzhou
Road related projects after the approval by the local government of the road. These projects comprise residential for end-users and upgraders,
shopping malls as well as serviced apartments and offices to satisfy different market demands.
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
(COVID-19) surfaced. COVID-19 has spread rapidly to many parts of the PRC and other parts of the world in the first quarter of 2020, which
has caused significant volatility in the PRC and international markets. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration
of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the PRC and international economies. For the quarter ended December
31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have did have a material net impact on the Company’s financial position and operating results,
especially Yang County which is operation was shut down. On and off from August 2022 onwards the extent of the impact on the Company’s
future financial results will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, the potential resurgence
of the pandemic, future government actions in response to the pandemic and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the local economy
and real estate markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. Given this uncertainty, the
Company is currently unable to quantify the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its future operations, financial condition, liquidity
and results of operations if the current situation continues.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis and base them on historical experience
and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances as the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates because
of different and changing assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following
critical accounting policies affect our significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements. These policies should be read in conjunction with Note 3 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements.
Revenue recognition
The Company follows FASB
ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, revenue is recognized in accordance with the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration
that the Company expects to be entitled to for those goods and services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following
steps:
● identification
of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
● identification
of the performance obligations in the contract;
● determination
of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
●
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
●
recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
22
Most of the Company’s
revenue is derived from real estate sales of condominiums and commercial properties in the PRC. The majority of the Company’s contracts
contain a single performance obligation involving significant real estate development activities that are performed together to deliver
a real estate property to its customers. Revenues arising from real estate sales are recognized when or as the control of the asset is
transferred to the customer. The control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. For the sales of individual condominium
units in a real estate development project, the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue
is recognized over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation (“percentage completion
method”). Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset. For the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any construction in progress meet the revenue recognition under percentage
completion method.

Contract balances
Timing of revenue recognition
may differ from the timing of billing and cash receipts from customers. The Company records a contract asset when revenue is recognized
prior to invoicing, or a contract liability when cash is received in advance of recognizing revenue. A contract asset is a right to consideration
that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Contract assets include billed and billable receivables, which are the
Company’s unconditional rights to consideration other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities include cash collected in advance
and in excess of revenue recognized. Customer deposits are excluded from contract liabilities.
The Company immediately
expenses sales commissions (included under selling expenses) because sales commission is not expected to be recovered.
The Company provides
“mortgage loan guarantees” only with respect to buyers who make down-payments of 20%-50% of the total purchase price of the
property. The period of the mortgage loan guarantee begins on the date the bank approves the buyer’s mortgage and we receive the
loan proceeds in our bank account and ends on the date the “Certificate of Ownership” evidencing that title to the property
has been transferred to the buyer. The procedures to obtain the Certificate of Ownership take six to twelve months (the “Mortgage
Loan Guarantee Period”). If, after investigation of the buyer’s income and other relevant factors, the bank decides not to
grant the mortgage loan, our mortgage-loan based sales contract terminates and there will be no guarantee obligation. If, during the Mortgage
Loan Guarantee Period, the buyer defaults on his or her monthly mortgage payment for three consecutive months, we are required
to return the loan proceeds back to the bank, although we have the right to keep the customer’s deposit and resell the property
to a third party. Once the Certificate of Ownership has been issued by the relevant government authority, our loan guarantee terminates.
If the buyer then defaults on his or her mortgage loan, the bank has the right to take the property back and sell it and use the proceeds
to pay off the loan. The Company is not liable for any shortfall that the bank may incur in this event. To date, no buyer has defaulted
on his or her mortgage payments during the Mortgage Loan Guarantee Period and the Company has not returned any loan proceeds pursuant
to its mortgage loan guarantees.
23
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the assumptions and estimates used by management in recognizing development revenue
under the percentage of completion method, the selection of the useful lives of property and equipment, provision necessary for contingent
liabilities, revenue recognition, taxes and budgeted costs. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing its consolidated
financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Real estate property development completed
and under development
Real estate property
consists of finished residential unit sites, commercial offices and residential unit sites under development. The Company leases the land
for the residential unit sites under land use right leases with various terms from the PRC government. The cost of land use rights is
included in the development cost and allocated to each project. Real estate property development completed and real estate property under
development are stated at the lower of cost or fair value.
Expenditures for land
development, including cost of land use rights, deed tax, pre-development costs, and engineering costs, exclusive of depreciation, are
capitalized and allocated to development projects by the specific identification method. Costs are allocated to specific units within
a project based on the ratio of the sales area of units to the estimated total sales area of the project (or phase of the project) multiplied
by the total cost of the project (or phase of the project).
Cost of amenities transferred
to buyers is allocated to specific units as a component of total construction cost. The amenity cost includes landscaping, road paving, etc.
Once the projects are completed, the amenities are under control of the property management companies.
Real estate property
development completed and under development are subject to valuation adjustments when the carrying amount exceeds fair value. An impairment
loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The Company reviews all of its
real estate projects for future losses and impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for each project to the
carrying value of such project. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not recognize any impairment loss
for its real estate properties.

Our revenues are derived from the sale of residential
buildings, commercial store-fronts and parking spaces in projects that we have developed. Comparing to the same period of last year, revenues
before sales tax decreased by 94.3% from approximately $2.9 million to approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended December
31, 2022. The total GFA sold during three months ended December 31, 2022 was 342 square meters, decreased from the 3,670 square meters
completed and sold during the same period of last year. The sales tax for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $2,000
decreased by 96.7% from same period of last year , consistent with the decreased revenue.
The year-over-year decrease in revenue was mainly
caused by the following reasons: 1) The macro-control of the real estate market by the Chinese government, mainly suppressed in the past
12 months; 2)China's economic downturn due to recurring epidemic; 3) Lower disposable income resulted in the decreased demand for housing;
4) The Company is a real estate developer in the third and fourth tier cities in China, the decline in house prices is especially obvious
than that in the first tier and second tier cities.

Our cost of sales consists
primarily of costs associated with land use rights and construction costs. Cost of sales are capitalized and allocated to development
projects using a specific identification method. Costs are allocated to specific units within a project based on the ratio of the sales
area of units to the estimated total sales area of the project or phase of the project times the total cost of the project or phase of
the project.
Cost of sales was approximately
$0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1.5 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in cost
of sales was mainly attributable to less GFA sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Land use rights cost:
The cost of land use rights includes the land premium we pay to acquire land use rights for our property development sites, plus taxes.
Our land use rights cost varies for different projects according to the size and location of the site and the minimum land premium set
for the site, all of which are influenced by government policies, as well as prevailing market conditions. Costs for land use rights for
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $0.006 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
25
Construction cost: We
outsource the construction of all of our projects to third party contractors, whom we select through a competitive tender process. Our
construction contracts provide a fixed payment which covers substantially all labor, materials and equipment costs, subject to adjustments
for some types of excess, such as design changes during construction or changes in government-suggested steel prices. Our construction
costs consist primarily of the payments to our third-party contractors, which are paid over the construction period based on specified
milestones. In addition, we purchase and supply a limited range of fittings and equipment, including elevators, window frames and door
frames. Our construction costs for the three months ending December 31, 2022 were approximately $0.1 million as compared to approximately
$1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of approximately $1.2 million. The decrease in construction
cost was due to less units sold during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
Gross Profit
Gross profit and gross margin were approximately
$0.03 million and 19.7 % respectively for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to approximately $1.4 million and
47.4% respectively in the same period of last year due to the economic downturn caused by the epidemic control in China and aforementioned.

Our general and administrative expense was approximately $0.57 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, decreased by $0.63
million from the three months ended December 31, 2021  due to no professional and consulting fees incurred in the 1st quarter of

Income Taxes
PRC Taxes
The Company’s PRC
subsidiary and VIE are governed by the Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China concerning the privately run enterprises,
which are generally subject to income tax on income reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriate tax adjustments.
The Company’s CIT rate is 25% on taxable income. Although the possibility exists for reinterpretation of the application of the
tax regulations by higher tax authorities in the PRC, potentially overturning the decision made by the local tax authority, the Company
has not experienced any reevaluation of the income taxes for prior years. The PRC tax rules are different from the local tax
rules and the Company is required to comply with local tax rules. The difference between the two tax rules will not be a liability
of the Company. There will be no further tax payments for the difference. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s
effective income tax rate was nil and 29%.
Net Income
We reported net loss
of approximately $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net income of approximately $0.4 for the three
months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to less revenue and more operating expenses as discussed
above.
Other Comprehensive Income
We operate primarily
in the PRC and the functional currency of our operating subsidiary and VIE is the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”).  RMB is not
freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation
is made that RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into USD at the rates used in translation.
Translation adjustments
resulting from this process amounted to $3.0 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The balance sheet amounts with the exception of equity at December 31, 2022 were translated at 6.8972 RMB to 1.00 USD as compared to 7.1135
RMB to 1.00 USD at September 30, 2022. The equity accounts were stated at their historical rate. The average translation rates applied
to the income statements accounts for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 7.1120 RMB and 6.3914 RMB, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
Our principal need for
liquidity and capital resources is to maintain working capital sufficient to support our operations and to make capital expenditures to
finance the growth of our business.
27
In recent years, the Chinese government has implemented
measures to control overheating residential and commercial property prices including but not limited to restrictions on home purchase,
increasing the down-payment requirement against speculative buying, development of low-cost rental housing properties to help low-income
groups while reducing the demand in the commercial housing market, increasing real estate property taxes to discourage speculation, control
of the land supply and slowdown the construction land auction process, etc. In addition, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
(COVID-19) surfaced. COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout China and worldwide, which has caused significant volatility in the PRC and
international markets. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as
well as its impact on the PRC and international economies. To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government has employed measures
including city lockdowns, quarantines, travel restrictions, suspension of business activities and school closures. Due to difficulties
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, the temporary closure of the Company’s facilities and operations
beginning in early February through early March 2020, limited support from the Company’s employees, delayed access to construction
raw material supplies, reduced customer visits to the Company’s sales office, and inability to promote real estate property sales
to customers on a timely basis, The Company experienced recovery of its real estate business in fiscal 2022 and the following period.
The Company had real estate sales of approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, decreased from $2.9
million in the same period of last year. Based on the assessment of the current economic environment, customer demand and sales trends,
we believe that consumer spending has been restored in the local real estate market and real estate sales are expected to grow in the
coming periods. On the other side, due to the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants, the development period of real
estate properties and our operating cycle has been extended and we may not be able to liquidate our large balance of completed real estate
properties within the short term as we originally expected. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had large construction loans payable
of approximately $111.8 million and accounts payable of approximately $10.9 million to be paid to subcontractors. The extent of the impact
of COVID-19 on the Company’s future financial results will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of
the crisis, the potential resurgence of the crisis, future government actions in response to the crisis and the overall impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the local economy and real estate markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable.
Given this uncertainty, the Company is currently unable to quantify the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its future operations,
financial condition, liquidity and results of operations if the current situation continues. The above-mentioned facts raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of this filing.
In assessing its liquidity, management monitors
and analyzes the Company’s cash on-hand, its ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future, and its operating and
capital expenditure commitments. As of December 31, 2022, our total cash and restricted cash balance was approximately $3.8 million, decreased
from approximately $4.4 million as of September 30, 2022. With respect to capital funding requirements, the Company budgeted its capital
spending based on ongoing assessments of needs to maintain adequate cash.  On October 25, 2022, the Company closed a private placement
with gross proceeds of $5.2 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $77.0 million of completed residential apartments and
commercial units available for sale to potential buyers. Although we reported approximately $10.9 million of accounts payable as of December
31, 2022, due to the long-term relationship with our construction suppliers and subcontractors, we were able to effectively manage cash
spending on construction and negotiate with them to adjust the payment schedule based on our cash on hand. In addition, most of our existing
real estate development projects relate to the old town renovation which is supported by the local government. As of December 31, 2022,
we reported approximately $111.8 million of construction loans borrowed from financial institutions controlled by the local government
and such loans can only be used on the old town renovation related project development. We expect that we will be able to renew all of
the existing construction loans upon their maturity and borrow additional new loans from local financial institutions, when necessary,
based on our past experience and the Company’s good credit history. Also, the Company’s cash flows from pre-sales and current
sales should provide financial support for our current development projects and operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
we had six large ongoing construction projects (see Note 4,  real estate properties under development) which were in the preliminary
development stage due to delayed inspection and acceptance of the development plans by the local government. In June 2020, we completed
the residence relocation surrounding the Liangzhou Road related projects and launched the construction of these projects in December 2020.
For the other four projects, we expect we will be able to obtain the government’s approval of the development plans on these projects
in the coming fiscal year and start the pre-sale of the real estate properties to generate cash when certain property development milestones
have been achieved.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements.
As
an industry practice, the Company provides guarantees to PRC banks with respect to loans procured by the purchasers of the
Company’s real estate properties for the total mortgage loan amount until the buyer obtains the “Certificate of
Ownership” of the properties from the government, which generally takes six to twelve months. Because the banks provide loan
proceeds without getting the “Certificate of Ownership” as loan collateral during the six-to-twelve-month period, the
mortgage banks require the Company to maintain, as restricted cash of at least 5% of the mortgage proceeds as security for the
Company’s obligations under such guarantees. If a purchaser defaults on its payment obligations, the mortgage bank may deduct
the delinquent mortgage payment from the security deposit and require the Company to pay the excess amount if the delinquent
mortgage payments exceed the security deposit. If the delinquent mortgage payments exceed the security deposit, the banks may
require us to pay the excess amount. If multiple purchasers’ default on their payment obligations at around the same time, we
will be required to make significant payments to the banks to satisfy our guarantee obligations. If we are unable to resell the
properties underlying defaulted mortgages on a timely basis or at prices higher than the amounts of our guarantees and related
expenses, we will suffer financial losses. The Company has the required reserves in its restricted cash account to cover any
potential mortgage defaults as required by the mortgage lenders. Since inception through the release of this report, the Company has
not experienced any delinquent mortgage loans and has not experienced any losses related to these guarantees.
As of December
31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, our outstanding guarantees in respect of our customers’ mortgage loans amounted to
approximately $25.7 million and 24.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the amount of restricted
cash reserved for these guarantees was approximately $2.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively, and the Company believes that
such reserves are sufficient.
Inflation
Inflationary factors,
such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs, could impair our operating results. Although we do not believe that
inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future
may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.
We Conduct Substantially All Our Business
in Foreign Country
Substantially all of
our operations are conducted in China and are subject to various political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties inherent in conducting
business in China. Among other risks, our Company and our subsidiaries’ operations are subject to the risks of restrictions on transfer
of funds; export duties, quotas, and embargoes; domestic and international customs and tariffs; changing taxation policies; foreign exchange
restrictions; and political conditions and governmental regulations.

deficiencies and to prevent similar deficiencies in the future, we are currently evaluating additional controls and procedures, which
may include:
● Provide
more U.S. GAAP knowledge and SEC reporting requirements training for the accounting department and establish formal policies and procedures.
The remedial measures
being undertaken may not be fully effectuated or may be insufficient to address the significant deficiencies we identified, and there
can be no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be
identified or occur in the future. If additional significant deficiencies (or if material weaknesses) in our internal controls are discovered
or occur in the future, among other similar or related effects: (i) the Company may fail to meet future reporting obligations on
a timely basis, (ii) the Company’s consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and (iii) the
Company’s business and operating results may be harmed.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
Except for the matters
described above to improve our internal controls over financial reporting, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting for the three months ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting, however, the Company is in the process of designing and planning to change as described
above.

In September 2013, the Company entered into an agreement (“Liangzhou Agreement”) with the Hanzhong local government on the Liangzhou Road reformation and expansion project (Liangzhou Road Project”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is contracted to reform and expand the Liangzhou Road, a commercial street in downtown Hanzhong City, with a total length of 2,080 meters and a width of 30 meters and to resettle the existing residences in the Liangzhou road area. The government’s original road construction budget was approximately $33 million in accordance with the Liangzhou Agreement. The Company, in return, is being compensated by the local government to have an exclusive right on acquiring at least 394.5 Mu land use rights in a specified location of Hanzhong City. The Liangzhou Road Project’s road construction started at the end of 2013. In 2014, the original scope and budget on the Liangzhou road reformation and expansion project was extended, because the local government included more area and resettlement residences into the project, which resulted in additional investments from the Company. In return, the Company is authorized by the local government to develop and manage the commercial and residential properties surrounding the Liangzhou Road project. The Company launched the construction of the Liangzhou Road related projects in December 2020. As of December 31, 2022, the main Liangzhou road construction is substantially completed.
The Company’s development cost incurred for the Liangzhou Road Project is treated as the Company’s deposit on purchasing the related land use rights, as agreed by the local government. As of December 31, 2022, the actual costs incurred by the Company were approximately $179.7 million (September 30, 2022 - $173.3 million) and the incremental cost related to residence resettlements approved by the local government. The Company determined that the Company’s Investment in the Liangzhou Road Project in exchange for interests in future land use rights is a barter transaction with commercial substance.
In September 2012, the Company was approved by the Hanzhong local government to construct four municipal roads with a total length of approximately 1,192 meters. The project was deferred and then restarted during the quarter ended June 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2022, the local government has not completed the budget for these projects therefore the delivery for these projects for the government’s acceptance and related settlement were extended to 2023.
The Company was engaged by the Yang County local government to construct the East 2nd Ring Road with a total length of 2.15 km. The local government is required to repay the Company’s project investment costs within 3 years with interest at the interest rate based on the commercial borrowing rate with the similar term published by the China Construction Bank (December 31, 2022 and 2021 – 4.75)%. The local government has approved a refund to the Company by reducing local surcharges or taxes otherwise required in the real estate development. The road construction was substantially completed as of December 31, 2022 and is in process of the government’s review and approval.
On June 26, 2015 and March 10, 2016, the Company signed phase I and Phase II agreements with Hanzhong Urban Construction Investment Development Co., Ltd, a state-owned Company, to borrow up to approximately $112.4 million (RMB775 million) for a long term loan with interest at 4.75% to develop the Liangzhou Road Project. As of December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed $94.6 million under this credit line (September 30, 2022 - $91.7 million). Due to the local government’s delay in the relocation
of residences in the Liangzhou Road Project and related area, the Hanzhong Urban Construction Investment Development Co., Ltd has not released all the funds available to the Company and additional withdrawals will be based on the project’s development progress and the Company expects the loan will be extended upon maturity. The loan is guaranteed by Hanzhong City Hantai District Municipal Government and pledged by the Company’s Yang County Yangzhou Palace project with a carrying value of $35.6 million as of December 31, 2022 (September 30, 2022- $34.6 million). For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the interest was $0.86 million (December 31, 2021 - $1.59 million), which was capitalized into the development cost of the Liangzhou Road Project.
In December 2016, the Company signed a loan agreement with Hantai District Urban Construction Investment Development Co., Ltd, a state-owned Company, to borrow up to approximately $17.3 million (RMB119 miilion) for the development of the Hanzhong City Liangzhou Road Project. The interest is 1.2% and due on June 20, 2031. The Company is required to repay the loan in equal annual principal repayments of approximately $3.3 million commencing from December 2027 through June 2031 with interest payable on an annual basis. The Company pledged the assets of the Liangzhou Road related projects with a carrying value of $179.7 million as collateral for the loan. Total interest of $0.05 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was capitalized into the development cost of the Hanzhong City Liangzhou Road Project (December 31, 2021- $0.06 miilion).
