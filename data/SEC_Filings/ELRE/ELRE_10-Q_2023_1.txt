NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   Yinfu Gold Corporation (the “Company”) is a Wyoming corporation incorporated on September 1, 2005 under the name Ace Lock and Security, Inc. with a fiscal year end of March 31. On March 5, 2007, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Wyoming Secretary of State to change the name to Element92 Resources Corp. and increased the authorized capital to
1,000,000,000
common shares. On August 16, 2010 the Company filed an amendment with the State of Wyoming changing its name from Element92 resources Corp. to Yinfu Gold Corporation and on November 18, 2010, the Company received a notification from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) that the Company’s change of name to Yinfu Gold Corporation was posted as effective with FINRA. The Company was established as an exploration stage company engaged in the search for commercially viable minerals.   The Company no longer pursues opportunities related to the exploration of minerals. The name changed signified that the Company has commenced working toward a major change in our business plan and business model.   Effective November 20, 2014, the Company executed a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) to acquire
100 % of the shares and assets of China Enterprise Overseas Investment & Finance Group Limited (“CEI”), a British Virgin Islands corporation. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue
800
million restricted common shares of the Company to the owners of CEI.   Pursuant to the Agreement, on or before January 1, 2015, CEI was to deliver to the Company, duly authorized, properly and fully executed documents in English, evidencing and confirming the sale of 100% of the shares of CEI and its assets , specifically detailing the assets and an asset valuation by a third-party valuator. The valuation report was received by the Company on January 28, 2015.   Additionally, the Agreement stated that both parties agreed that all shares issued, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement, were to be issued as soon as practicable following the signing of the agreement, but all shares so issued were to be held in escrow until all terms and conditions are met.   The various terms and conditions of the Agreement were fulfilled on January 28, 2015, therefore, the share certificates representing the shares have been issued in the names of the CEI shareholders and the Agreement between the Company and CEI was closed on January 28, 2015.   On April 11, 2017, the Company acquired Yinfu Gold International Holdings Limited (“HK”), a company incorporated in Hong Kong, and HK’s subsidiary, Yinfu International Holdings Limited (“WOFE”), a wholly owned foreign enterprise incorporated in the People’s Republic of China. The acquired entities are owned by the Company’s management; therefore, the transaction has been accounted for as a business combination under common control in accordance to ASC-805-30-5, in which the assets and liabilities of HK and WOFE have been presented at their carrying values at the date of the transaction.   During the year ended March 31, 2018, we disposed the discontinued business, Element Resources International Limited. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the disposal.   The accompanying comparative financial statements have been retroactively restated to combine the financial data of previously separate entities with those of the Company.   8 Table of Contents   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.   In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for (a) the financial position, (b) the result of operations, and (c) cash flows have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. The condensed consolidated financial information as of March 31, 2022 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements not included herein. Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.   Interim Financial Information   The unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to interim financial information and the requirements of Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosure required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been included.   These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022, as not all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements are presented. The interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of computations as the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022.   Principles of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.
Name of Subsidiary   State or Jurisdiction of Organization of Entity   Attributable equity interest   Yinfu Group Overseas Investment & Finance Limited (“BVI”)   British Virgin Island     100 % Yinfu Group International Holdings Limited (“HK”)   Hong Kong     100 % Yinfu International Holdings Limited (“WOFE”)   Shenzhen, People Republic of China     100 % Yinfu International Holdings Limited Huizhou Branch (“WOFE”)   Huizhou, People Republic of China     100 %   Yinfu Group Overseas Investment & Finance Limited is a holding entity established in BVI that did not have any activities or operations since inception.   On June 25, 2019, the management decided to abandon the BVI entity and transfer its subsidiaries Yinfu Group International Holdings Limited and Yinfu International Holdings Limited (“WOFE”) to Yinfu Gold Corp.
Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.
9 Table of Contents   Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value.
Foreign Currency Translation and Re-measurement   In accordance with ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Matters”, the Company’s foreign operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, the assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are charged to operations as incurred. The Company had foreign currency translations gain of $ 84,987
and loss of $ 25,370
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively.   Concentrations of Credit Risk   The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents as well as related party payables that it will likely incur in the near future. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company’s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposure is limited.   Financial Instruments   The Company follows ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:   Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.   Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   10 Table of Contents   Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2022. The carrying values of our financial instruments, including, cash and cash equivalents; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and loans and notes payable approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.   Business Combinations   In accordance with ASC 805-10, “Business Combinations”, the Company accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, assets and liabilities, including any remaining noncontrolling interests, are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests is recognized as goodwill. Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets, liabilities, or noncontrolling interests made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one year, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. Any cost or equity method interest that the Company holds in the acquired company prior to the acquisition is re-measured to fair value at acquisition with a resulting gain or loss recognized in income for the difference between fair value and the existing book value. Results of operations of the acquired entity are included in the Company’s results from the date of the acquisition onward and include amortization expense arising from acquired tangible and intangible assets.   Income Taxes, Deferred Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance   The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.   Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock   The Company has adopted ASC Topic 260,
“Earnings per Share,”
(“EPS”) which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.   The Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.   The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings (loss) per share, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:       Nine
Months Ended Dece mber 3 1 ,       2022     2021   Net loss
$ ( 342,635

)   $ ( 0.18
)   11 Table of Contents   Commitments and Contingencies   The Company follows ASC 450-20, “Loss Contingencies,” to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, as well as other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.   Leases   We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, operating lease liabilities - current, and operating lease liabilities - noncurrent on the balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our balance sheets.   ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   Advertising Costs
The Company follows ASC 720, “Advertising Costs,” and expenses costs as incurred. No advertising costs were incurred for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively.   Related Parties   The Company follows ASC 850,
“Related Party Disclosures,”
for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. See note 7.   Revenue Recognition   The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Topic 606 on April 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.   The adoption of Topic 606 has no impact on the Company’s financials as the Company has not generated any revenues.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”). The amendments in ASU 2018-13 modify the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 effective January 1, 2020, and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU provides an exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. This update also (1) requires an entity to recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, (2) requires an entity to evaluate when a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which goodwill was originally recognized for accounting purposes and when it should be considered a separate transaction, and (3) requires that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective January 1, 2021, and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies an issuer’s accounting for certain convertible instruments and the application of derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. This guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and required enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new guidance is required to be applied either retrospectively to financial instruments outstanding as of the beginning of the first comparable reporting period for each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change to be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2023 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effects, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective recently had or is expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures.   12 Table of Contents   NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN
The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not established an on-going source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost, and requires additional capital to commence its operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 2,744,104 , and net loss of $ 342,635
and net cash used in operations of $ 86,706
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the operating of the two new wholly owned subsidiaries. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.   In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan to obtain such resources for the Company include: sales of equity instruments; traditional financing, such as loans; and obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.   There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.   13 Table of Contents   NOTE 4-STOCKHOLDERS’EQUITY (DEFICIT)   Common Stock   The Company is authorized to issue

NOTE 6 – LEASES   The Company has a lease agreement for its office space. The current lease agreement was signed to cover the lease for the period from May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2023.
The Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate for this lease based primarily on its lease term in PRC which is approximately
4.75 %.   The Company has elected not to recognize lease assets and liabilities for leases if the lease term, which includes periods covered by renewal options whose exercise is reasonably certain, is less than 12 months.   Operating lease expenses were $ 36,129
and $ 58,295
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Management’s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures   As of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.
The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officer in connection with their review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022.
Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors’ results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   19 Table of Contents   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings and, to our knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or pending.
However, we noted the following risks arising recently:   · Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.   The PRC government will establish a foreign investment information reporting system, according to which foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information to the competent department for commerce concerned through the enterprise registration system and the enterprise credit information publicity system, and a security review system under which the security review shall be conducted for foreign investment affecting or likely affecting the state security.   Furthermore, the Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign invested enterprises established according to the existing laws regulating foreign investment may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementing of the Foreign Investment Law.   In addition, the Foreign Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments in the PRC, including, among others, that a foreign investor may freely transfer into or out of China, in Renminbi or a foreign currency, its contributions, profits, capital gains, income from disposition of assets, royalties of intellectual property rights, indemnity or compensation lawfully acquired, and income from liquidation, among others, within China; local governments shall abide by their commitments to the foreign investors; governments at all levels and their departments shall enact local normative documents concerning foreign investment in compliance with laws and regulations and shall not impair legitimate rights and interests, impose additional obligations onto FIEs, set market access restrictions and exit conditions, or intervene with the normal production and operation activities of FIEs; except for special circumstances, in which case statutory procedures shall be followed and fair and reasonable compensation shall be made in a timely manner, expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited; and mandatory technology transfer is prohibited.   ● The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. We are currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S exchanges, however, if our VIE or the holding company were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on U.S. exchange, which would materially affect the interest of the investors.   The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. The central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties.   For example, the Chinese cybersecurity regulator announced on July 2 that it had begun an investigation of Didi Global Inc. (NYSE: DIDI) and two days later ordered that the company’s app be removed from smartphone app stores.   As such, the Company’s business segments may be subject to various government and regulatory interference in the provinces in which they operate. The Company could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities, including various local and municipal agencies and government sub-divisions. The Company may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply.
Furthermore, it is uncertain when and whether the Company will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges in the future, and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. Although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC federal or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry.   20 Table of Contents   Item 1A.
