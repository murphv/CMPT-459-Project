Forward-Looking
Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements give E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.'s (we, our, us, Company or E2open) current expectations and include projections of results of operations or financial condition or forecasts of future events. Words such as "may," "can," "should," "will," "estimate," "plan," "project," "forecast," "intend," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "seek," "target" and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, forward-looking statements contained in this document include our expectations regarding our future growth, operational and financial performance and business prospects and opportunities.
These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report and management's then current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control and our directors, officers and affiliates. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We do not undertake any obligation to update, add or to otherwise correct any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events, inaccuracies that become apparent after the date hereof or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.
As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include:
• the effect of the volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions, including the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the related sanctions and other measures that have been and continue to be imposed in response to the conflict, inflation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the potential effects of these factors on our business, results of operations and financial condition as well as our clients' businesses and levels of business activity;
• changes in market interest rates particularly on our variable rate debt, including the recent significant increases in market interest rates experienced so far in fiscal 2023 and that may continue to increase;
• the inability to develop and market new product innovations and monetize our network;
• risks associated with our past and prospective acquisitions (including the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions), including the failure to successfully integrate operations, personnel, systems and products of the acquired companies, adverse tax consequences of acquisitions, greater than expected liabilities of the acquired companies, charges to earnings from acquisitions, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage profitability, maintain relationships with clients and suppliers and retain its management and key employees and the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition;
• the inability to develop and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting;
• the inability to attract new clients or upsell/cross sell existing clients or the failure to renew existing client subscriptions on term favorable to us;
• risks associated with our extensive and expanding international operations, including the risks created by geopolitical instability;
• the failure of the market for cloud-based SCM solutions to develop as quickly as we expect or failure to compete successfully in a fragmented and competitive SCM market;
• the inability to adequately protect key intellectual property rights or proprietary technology;
• the diversion of management's attention and consumption of resources as a result of potential acquisitions of other companies;
• failure to maintain adequate operational and financial resources or raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows;
• cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities; and
• certain other factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.
For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results and performance, see Part I, Item 1A.,
Risk Factors
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K).

E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
1.	Organization and Basis of Presentation Organization and Description of Business CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (CCNB1) was a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on January 14, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. CCNB1's sponsor was CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Sponsor). CCNB1 became a public company on April 28, 2020 through an initial public offering. On February 4, 2021 (Closing Date), CCNB1 and E2open Holdings, LLC and its operating subsidiaries (E2open Holdings) completed a business combination (Business Combination) contemplated by the definitive Business Combination Agreement entered into on October 14, 2020 (Business Combination Agreement). In connection with the finalization of the Business Combination, CCNB1 changed its name to "E2open Parent Holdings, Inc." (E2open) and changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware (Domestication). Immediately following the Domestication, various entities merged with and into E2open, with E2open as the surviving company. Additionally, E2open Holdings became a subsidiary of E2open with the equity interests of E2open Holdings held by E2open and existing owners of E2open Holdings. The existing owners of E2open Holdings are considered noncontrolling interests in the condensed consolidated financial statements. We are headquartered in Austin, Texas. We are a leading provider of cloud-based, end-to-end omni-channel and supply chain management software. Our software combines networks, data and applications to provide a deeply embedded, mission-critical platform that allows clients to optimize their supply chain by accelerating growth, reducing costs, increasing visibility and driving improved resiliency. Given the business-critical nature of our solutions, we maintain deep, long-term relationships with our clients across a wide range of end-markets, including technology, consumer, industrial and transportation, among others. Basis of Presentation These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Investments in other companies are carried at cost. See Note 10,
Investments
for additional information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2023 . For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2022 Form 10-K. Use of Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported results of operations during the reporting period. Such management estimates include allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other long-lived assets, estimates of standalone selling price of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations, share-based compensation, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, tax receivable agreement liability, warrants, contingent consideration and the accounting for business combinations. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from management's estimates. Reclassifications During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we began reporting deferred income taxes as a separate line as part of operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As a result, we reclassed a use of cash of
$ 17.8
million from the change in other liabilities to deferred income taxes for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. 11
During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we began reporting current income taxes payable as a separate line on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, we reclassed $ 2.7
million from accounts payable and accrued liabilities to current income taxes payable in the February 28, 2022 balance sheet. We also combined the long-term investments line of $ 0.2
million with the other noncurrent assets line in the February 28, 2022 balance sheet. The incentive program payable was renamed to channel client deposits payable to better describe the payable associated with the restricted cash deposits. Channel client deposits are deposits that we receive
from certain channel shaping clients to reimburse, on our clients' behalf, market development expenditures made by our client channel partners. Seasonality Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including seasonality in our business as a result of client budget cycles and customary European vacation schedules, with higher sales typically in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.
2.	Accounting Standards Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
to simplify the accounting for contract modifications made to replace LIBOR or other reference rates that are expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The guidance provides optional expediates and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criterion are met. The optional expedients and exceptions can be applied to contract modifications made until December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)
which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The amendments in ASU 2021-01 are elective and apply to our debt instruments that may be modified as a result of the reference rate reform. We are continuing to evaluate these standards, as well as the timing of the transition of various rates in our debt instruments affected by reference rate reform.
3.	Acquisitions Logistyx Acquisition On March 2, 2022, E2open, LLC acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Logistyx for a purchase price of $ 185
million, with an estimated fair value of $ 183.4
million, including $ 90
million paid in cash at closing (Logistyx Acquisition). An additional $ 95
million, which was subject to standard working capital adjustments and other contractual provisions, was paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and September 1, 2022. We had the option to finance the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment of $ 37.4
million was paid in cash. On August 15, 2022, E2open, LLC and the sellers of Logistyx agreed to extend the final payment to
September 1, 2022
allowing both parties to finalize
working capital adjustments and other contractual provisions. On September 1, 2022, E2open, LLC made a cash payment of $ 54.0
million to Logistyx as the final installment payment for the Logistyx Acquisition which reflected a working capital adjustment of $ 3.6
million. The Logistyx sellers disputed the working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement. During October 2022, the parties agreed to a working capital adjustment of $ 2.6
million. The additional payment for working capital was made to Logistyx on December 5, 2022. The Logistyx Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805,
Business Combinations. The following summarizes the consideration paid for the Logistyx Acquisition.

(1) Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in the Logistyx Acquisition. Goodwill associated with the Logistyx Acquisition is deductible for tax purposes at the U.S. entity level. (2) The deferred revenue was recorded under ASC 606 in accordance with ASU 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers;
therefore, a reduction in deferred revenues related to the estimated fair values of the acquired deferred revenues was not required. (3) The adjustments primarily relate to the $ 0.4
million change in fair value of the intangible assets due to a change in the deferred revenue and $ 2.6
million working capital adjustment. The fair value of the intangible assets is as follows:

The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on preliminary valuations performed to determine the fair value of the net assets as of March 2, 2022. This allocation is subject to revision as the assessment is based on preliminary information subject to refinement. We incu rred $ 4.0
million ($ 0.7
million as o f February 28, 2022) of expenses directly related to the Logistyx Acquisition through November 30, 2022
which are included in acquisition-related expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in these expenses were $ 1.6
million acquisition-related advisory fees which were incurred on March 2, 2022. At the closing of the Logistyx Acquisition, we paid $ 0.5
million of acquisition-related advisory fees and other expenses related to the Logistyx Acquisition on behalf of Logistyx. These expenses were part of the purchase price consideration and not recognized as expense in our or Logistyx's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 13
BluJay Acquisition On May 27, 2021, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with the BluJay Sellers to acquire all of the outstanding equity of BluJay. On September 1, 2021 (Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of BluJay (BluJay Acquisition). The BluJay Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805,
Business Combinations. The cash consideration in the BluJay Acquisition was provided by $ 380.0
million in proceeds from the issuance of an incremental term loan, $ 300.0
million in PIPE financing from institutional investors for the purchase of an aggregate of

(1) Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in the BluJay Acquisition. Goodwill associated with the BluJay Acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. (2) Current liabilities include a $ 2.7
million deferred acquisition liability that was acquired related to a prior acquisition by BluJay. The deferred acquisition liability was a fixed amount that was determined at the closing of the acquisition and payable after a certain period of time. The deferred acquisition liability was paid in December 2021. (3) The deferred revenue was recorded under ASC 606 in accordance with ASU 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers;
therefore, a reduction in deferred revenues related to the estimated fair values of the acquired deferred revenues was not required. 14
(4) The adjustments primarily relate to the jurisdictional netting of income taxes, impact of a tax rate change on the deferred balance and the reinstatement of income tax receivables along with the true-up of accrued liabilities. The fair value of the intangible assets is as follows:

We incurred $ 33.7

million acquisition-related advisory fees which were incurred on the Acquisition Date. In addition, we paid $ 10.4
million of debt issuance costs associated with the $ 380.0
million incremental term loan on the Acquisition Date which were capitalized and recorded as a reduction of the outstanding debt balances. At the closing of the BluJay Acquisition, we paid $ 7.1
million in fees related to the $ 300.0
million PIPE financing which were recorded as a reduction to the proceeds from the issuance of Class A Common Stock in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Additionally, we paid $ 26.7
million of acquisition-related advisory fees and other expenses related to the BluJay Acquisition on behalf of BluJay. These expenses were part of the purchase price consideration and not recognized as expense in our or BluJay's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, the Investor Rights Agreement was amended and restated to add certain of BluJay's existing stockholders as parties, including certain affiliates of Francisco Partners and Temasek.
The Investor Rights Agreement provides Francisco Partners and Temasek the right to nominate one member each to our board of directors. Mr. Deep Shah, nominated by Francisco Partners, and Mr. Martin Fichtner, nominated by Temasek, became new directors on September 1, 2021 . Unaudited Pro Forma Operating Results The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information presents the results of operations as if the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions happened as of March 1, 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital, capital expenditure needs, contractual obligations and other commitments, with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Current working capital needs relate mainly to employee compensation and benefits, as well as interest, debt repayments, capital expenditures and operating expenses. Our ability to expand and grow our business will depend on many factors, including working capital needs and the evolution of operating cash flows. We h ad $ 85.7

in cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2022. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities, and, if necessary, the borrowing capacity of up
to $ 145.0
million
available under our 2021 Revolving
15
Credit Facility (see Note 13,
Notes Payable ) will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt repayment and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing.

7.	Goodwill During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, we assess our goodwill for potential impairment. This impairment testing is applied more frequently if we become aware of events or circumstances since the last impairment testing that might call into question whether the current balances are fairly recorded. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the market price of our Class A common stock and market capitalization declined significantly. This decline resulted in us determining that a triggering event occurred and an interim goodwill impairment assessment was performed. We performed a qualitative "Step 0" goodwill impairment assessment during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 which indicated that a quantitative "Step 1" impairment analysis needed to be performed as well. The fair value of E2open was determined using a discounted cash flow method, guideline public company method and guideline transaction method using an income-based and market-based approach. We calculated the fair value of E2open under three different methods: discounted cash flow method, guideline public company method and guideline transaction method. The discounted cash flow method was based on the present value of estimated future cash flows which were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and net operating income margins, taking into consideration market and industry conditions. The discount rate used was based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the risk, size premium and business-specific characteristics related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the guideline public company method, the fair value was based on forward-looking earnings multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar market position and size. The unobservable inputs used to measure the fair value included projected revenue growth rates, the weighted average cost of capital, the normalized working capital level, capital expenditures assumptions, profitability projections, control premium, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates. Under the guideline transaction method, the fair value was based on pricing multiples derived from recently sold companies with similar characteristics to ours. The three approaches generated similar results and indicated that the fair value of E2open's equity and goodwill was less than its carrying amount. Therefore, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of
$ 514.8
m illion to goodwill. We did
no t record a goodwill impairment charge for the three months ended
November 30, 2022 or the three and nine months ended November 30, 2021. The following table presents the changes in goodwill:

10.	Investments On February 4, 2022, we made a minority investment of $ 2.5
million in a private firm focused on supply chain financing. We made the required second investment of $ 2.5
million on May 5, 2022 along with $ 0.5
million of transaction fees. This minority investment does not have a readily determinable fair value; therefore, we elected the measurement alternative for our minority investment. The investment is measured at cost, less impairment and adjusted for qualifying observable price changes and recorded in other noncurrent assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investment for impairment and whether any events or circumstances are identified that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment. In the event a decline in fair value is less than the investment's carrying value, we will record an impairment charge in other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have
no t recorded any impairment charges related to this minority investment.

12.	Tax Receivable Agreement E2open Holdings entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with selling equity holders of E2open Holdings that requires us to pay
85 % of the tax savings that are realized because of increases in the tax basis in E2open Holdings' assets. This increase is either from the sale or exchange of the Common Units for shares of Class A Common Stock and cash, as well as from tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We will retain the benefit of the remaining
15 % of these cash savings. The Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless E2open Holdings exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other accelerated events occur. Quarterly tax distributions will be paid to the holders of Common Units on a pro rata basis based upon an agreed upon formula related to the taxable income of E2open Holdings allocable to holders of Common Units. Generally, these tax distributions will be computed based on the Company's estimate of taxable income of E2open Holdings allocable to each holder of Common Units (based on certain assumptions), multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for a U.S. corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, taking into account all jurisdictions in which the Company is required to file income tax returns together with the relevant apportionment information and the character of E2open Holdings' income, subject to various adjustments. 19
Significant inputs and assumptions were used to estimate the future expected payments including the timing of the realization of the tax benefits, a tax rate of
24.1 % and an imputed interest rate of
7 % based on our cost of debt plus an incremental premium at the Closing Date. Changes in any of these or other factors are expected to impact the timing and amount of gross payments. The fair value of these obligations w ill be accreted to the amount of the gross expected obligation. In addition, if E2open Holdings were to exercise its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur, E2open Holdings will be required to make immediate cash payments. Such cash payments will be equal to the present value of the assumed future realized tax benefits based on a set of assumptions and using an agreed upon discount rate, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits. Such payments will be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that E2open Holdings has sufficient taxable income to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement over the period specified therein. The payments that E2open Holdings will be required to make will generally reduce the amount of the overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related tax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments. Pursuant to ASC 805,
Business Combination
and relevant tax law, we have calculated the fair value of the tax receivable agreement payments related to the transaction at the acquisition date and identified the timing of the utilization of the tax attributes. Under ASC 805, the Tax Receivable Agreement liability, as of the acquisition date, will be revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss as well as the associated interest reflected in the gain (loss) from change in tax receivable agreement liability in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the event occurred. Interest will accrue on the tax receivable agreement liability at a rate of LIBOR plus
100
basis points. In addition, under ASC 450,
Contingencies
transactions with partnership unit holders after the acquisition date will result in additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities that are recorded on a gross undiscounted basis. The Tax Receivable Agreement liability
was $ 58.2
millio n
and $ 66.6
million as of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 , respectively. The tax rate used in the calculation was
24.2 % and
24.1 % as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively. The discount rate used for the ASC 805 calculation was
10.4 % and
8.2 %
as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively, based on our cost of debt plus an incremental premium. During the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, a gain
of $ 2.7
million and a loss
of $ 1.5
million, respectively, was recorded as a change in the tax receivable agreement liability related to the ASC 805 discounted liability. During the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021, a gain
of $ 9.1
m illion and a loss of $ 4.6
million, respectively, was recorded as a change in the tax receivable agreement liability related to the ASC 805 discounted liability. During the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 increased b y $ 0.7

2021 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility In February 2021, E2open, LLC, our subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) that provided for $ 525.0
million in term loans (2021 Term Loan) and $ 75.0
million in commitments for revolving credit loans (2021 Revolving Credit Facility) with a $ 15.0
million letter of credit sublimit. In September 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended to include a $ 380.0
million incremental term loan, an increase in the letter of credit sublimit from $ 15.0
million to $ 30.0
million and an increase in the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility from $ 75.0
million to $ 155.0
million. In April 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to include a $ 190.0
million incremental term loan. 20
The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will mature on
February 4, 2026 . E2open, LLC can request increases in the revolving commitments and additional term loan facilities, in minimum amounts of $ 2.0
million for each facility. Principal payments are due on the Credit Agreement the last day of February, May, August and November commencing August 2021. The Credit Agreement was payable in
quarterly
installments
of $ 1.3
mill ion beginning in August 2021; however, the payments were increased to $ 2.3
million with the addition of the incremental term loan beginning in November 2021. The payment increased to $ 2.7
million with the addition of the $ 190.0
million incremental term loan beginning in May 2022. The Credit Agreement is payable in full on
February 4, 2028 . The proceeds from the $ 190.0
million incremental term loan were used to repay the $ 80.0
million outstanding balance under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility incurred to finance the initial payment for the Logistyx Acquisition. The additional cash was used to pay the $ 37.4
million payment due to Logistyx in May 20 22 and for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by E2open Intermediate, LLC, our subsidiary, and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of E2open, LLC, as guarantors, and is supported by a security interest in substantially all of the guarantors' personal property and assets. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default, representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the 2021 Term Loan had a variable interest rate of
6.64 % and
4.00 %, respectively. There we re $ 10.0
million outstanding borrowings at an interest rate of
6.77 %, no letters of credit and $ 145.0
millio n available borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of November 30, 2022 . There were $ 80.0
million borrowings outstanding at an interest rate of
5.25 %, no letters of credit and $ 75.0
million available borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of
February 28, 2022. We were in compliance with the First Lien Leverage Ratio for the Credit Agreement as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 .
14.	Contingent Consideration Business Combination The contingent consideration liability is due to the issuance of Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Series 1 restricted common units (RCUs) and Series 2 RCUs of E2open Holdings as part of the Business Combination. These shares and units were issued on a proportional basis to each holder of Class A shares in CCNB1 and Common Units of E2open Holdings. These restricted shares and Common Units are treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value. The contingent consideration liability was recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and will be remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Any gain or loss recognized from the remeasurement will be recorded in gain (loss) from the change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a nonoperating income (expense) as the change in fair value is not part of our core operating activities. The contingent consideration liability
was $ 27.8
million and $ 45.6
million as of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 , respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a gain of $ 6.3
million and loss of $ 1.1
million for the three months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a gain of $ 17.8
million a nd loss of $ 77.5
million for the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The
8,120,367
shares of Series B-1 common stock, including the Sponsor Side Letter shares noted below, automatically convert into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis upon the occurrence of the first day on which the
5 -day VWAP of our Class A Common Stock is equal to at least $ 13.50
per share; provided, however, that the reference to $ 13.50
per share shall be decreased by the aggregate per share amount of dividends actually paid in respect of a share of Class A Common Stock following the closing of the Business Combination. As of June 8, 2021, the
5 -day VWAP of our Class A Common Stock exceeded $ 13.50
per share which was the triggering event for
the Series B-1 common stock to automatically convert into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis . As such,
8,120,273
shares of Series B-1 common stock converted into
8,120,273
shares of Class A Common Stock. There were
94
shares of Series B-1 common stock pending conversion as of
November 30, 2022. There were
3,372,184
shares of Series B-2 common stock outstanding as of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 .
The Series B-2 common stock will automatically convert into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis
upon the occurrence of the first day on which the 20-day VWAP is equal to at least $ 15.00
per share; provided, however, that the reference to $ 15.00
per share shall be decreased by the aggregate per share amount of dividends actually paid in respect of a share of Class A Common Stock following the closing of the Business Combination. 21
Similar to the Series B-1 common stock, the
4,379,557
shares of Series 1 RCUs vest and become Common Units of E2open Holdings at such time as the
5 -day VWAP of the Class A Common Stock is at least $ 13.50
per share; however, the $ 13.50
per share threshold will be decreased by the aggregate amount of dividends per share paid following the closing of the Business Combination. As of June 8, 2021, the 5-day VWAP of our Class A Common Stock exceeded $ 13.50
per share which was the triggering event for the Series 1 RCUs to vest and become Common Units of E2open Holdings. As such,
4,379,557
Series 1 RCUs became
4,379,557
Common Units of E2open Holdings along with entitling the holders of the newly vested common units to
4,379,557
shares of Class V Common Stock. Catch-Up Payments were not required as a result of the Series 1 RCU vesting. There were
2,627,724
shares of Series 2 RCUs outstanding as of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 . Similar to the Series B-2 common stock, the Series 2 RCUs will vest (a) at such time as the 20-day VWAP of the Class A Common Stock is at least $ 15.00
per share; however, the $ 15.00
per share threshold will be decreased by the aggregate amount of dividends per share paid following the closing of the Business Combination; (b) upon the consummation of a qualifying change of control of us or the Sponsor and (c) upon the qualifying liquidation defined in the limited liability company agreement. Upon the conversion of an RCU, the holder of such RCU will be entitled to receive a payment equal to the amount of ordinary distributions paid on an E2open Holdings unit from the Closing Date through (but not including) the date such RCU converts into an E2open Holdings unit. If any of the RCUs do not vest on or before the
10-year
anniversary of the Closing Date, such units will be canceled for no consideration, and will not be entitled to receive any Catch-Up Payments. We have not paid any dividends to date and do not expect to in the future. Sponsor Side Letter
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor, certain investors and CCNB1's Independent Directors entered into the Sponsor Side Letter Agreement with CCNB1. Under the Sponsor Side Letter Agreement,
2,500,000
Class B ordinary shares of CCNB1 held by the Sponsor and CCNB1's Independent Directors automatically converted into
2,500,000
shares of Series B-1 Common Stock, which, collectively, are referred to as the Restricted Sponsor Shares. The vesting conditions of the shares of Series B-1 Common Stock mirror the Series 1 RCUs. These restricted shares were treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value. The contingent consideration liability was recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Any gain or loss recognized from the remeasurements was recorded in gain (loss) from the change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a nonoperating income (expense) as the change in fair value was not part of our core operating activities. As of June 8, 2021, the
5 -day VWAP of our Class A Common Stock exceeded $ 13.50
per share which was the triggering event for
the Series B-1 common stock to automatically convert into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis . The fair value remeasurements through June 8, 2021 resulted in a loss of $ 13.7
million for the nine months ended
November 30, 2021. 15.	Financial Instruments We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and provide qualitative and quantitative disclosures about such derivatives. We have international operations that expose us to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted operating expenses, we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts related to changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency relationship. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Our derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement that generally includes standard netting arrangements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties to our derivative contracts. We actively monitor our exposure to credit risk, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with high credit quality financial institutions and mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We have not experienced any instances of non-performance by any counterparties. The assets or liabilities associated with the forward contracts are recorded at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other noncurrent assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the foreign currency forward contract and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. The cash flow impact upon settlement of the derivate contracts will be included in net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 22
Cash Flow Hedging Activities Our foreign exchange forward contracts are designed and qualify as cash flow hedges. The contracts currently hedge the U.S. dollar/Indian Rupee relationship with the duration of these forward contracts ranging from
one-month
to
24-month s at inception. These contracts cover a portion of our spend in Indian Rupee. We have not hedged our exposure to revenue or expenses in other currencies. To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes in future cash flows on the hedged transactions. The related gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity and reclassified into operating expenses when the hedge is settled. As of November 30, 2022, our foreign exchange forward contracts have durations of approxima tely
21 mo nths
or less. Our exposure to the market gains or losses will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The following table represents the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets location and amount of the derivative instrument fair values:

We estimate the $ 0.5
million, net of tax, of losses on forward exchange currency derivatives instruments included in other comprehensive loss will be settled and reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. We report our foreign exchange forward contract assets and liabilities on a net basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets when a master-netting arrangement exists between us and the counterparty to the contract. A standard master netting agreement exists between us and the counterparty to the foreign exchange forward contract entered into in August 2022. The agreement allows for multiple transaction payment netting and none of the netting arrangements involve collateral. As of November 30, 2022, all of the foreign exchange forward contracts are in a liability position. See Note 22,
Other Comprehensive Loss
for additional information regarding our cash flow hedges.
16.	Fair Value Measurement Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents; investments; accounts receivable, net; accounts payable; acquisition-related obligations; notes payable; and financing lease obligations. Accounts receivable, net; accounts payable; and acquisition-related obligations are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value, due to their short maturity. We measure our cash equivalents and investments at fair value, based on an exchange or exit price which represents the amount that would be received for an asset sale or an exit price, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable and willing market participants. We estimate the fair value for notes payable and financing lease obligations by discounting the future cash flows of the related note and lease payments. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the fair value of the cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes payable and financing lease obligations approximates their recorded values. The following tables set forth details about our investments:

Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value certain financial instruments. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. 23
Our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy are summarized as follows:

Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units Cash-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) form part of our compensation program. The fair value of these awards are determined using the closing stock price of our Class A Common Stock on the last day of each balance sheet date which is considered an observable quoted market price in active markets (Level 1). Contingent Consideration The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of acquisition related accrued earn-outs and contingent consideration using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) from March 1, 2022 through

The change in the fair value of the warrant liability is recorded in gain (loss) from change in fair value of warrant liability in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair values of our Level 1 financial instruments, which are traded in active markets, are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair values of our Level 2 financial instruments are based on quoted market prices for comparable instruments or model-driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our earn-out liabilities and contingent consideration are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. These valuation models use unobservable market input, and therefore the liabilities are classified as Level 3. Our public warrants are valued using active market quoted prices, which are Level 1 inputs. The private placement warrants are valued using a binomial pricing model when the warrants are subject to the make-whole table, or otherwise are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The Forward Purchase Warrants are valued utilizing observable market prices for public shares and warrants, relative to the present value of contractual cash proceeds. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend yield, expiration dates and risk-free interest rates. These valuation models use unobservable market input, and therefore the liability is classified as both Level 1 and Level 3.
17.	Revenue We primarily generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions and professional services. We recognize revenue when the client contract and associated performance obligations have been identified, transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and performance obligations have been satisfied. We recognize revenue net of any taxes collected from clients, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Other revenue is recognized when the service is delivered to the client. 25

Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of our contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the client. Americas revenue attributed to the United States w as
83 % and
81 % du ring the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Americas revenue attributed to the United States
was
83 % and
89 % du ring the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No other country represented more than 10% of total revenue during these periods. During the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, we recor ded a $ 0.1
million and $ 10.4
million reduction to revenue to amortize the deferred revenue fair value adjustment that resulted from the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination, respectively. During the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021 , we recorded a $ 0.4
million an d $ 47.1
million reduction to revenue to amortize the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, respectively.
With the early adoption of ASU 2021-08, a fair value adjustment to deferred revenue is no longer required; therefore, an adjustment to deferred revenue was not made for the BluJay or Logistyx acquisitions. Remaining Performance Obligations Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied. It includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods and does not include contracts where the client is not committed. The client is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty under the contract. Additionally, as a practical expedient of ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
we have not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, approximatel y $ 795.1
million and $ 767.9
million of revenue was expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations, respectively. These amounts are expected to be recognized within the next
five years . Contract Assets and Liabilities Contract assets primarily represent revenues recognized for performance obligations that have been satisfied but for which amounts have not been billed. Contract assets w ere $ 28.5
million
and $ 14.6
million as of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which includes billings in excess of revenue recognized related to subscription contracts and professional services. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when we perform under the contract. Deferred revenue w as $ 176.0
million an d $ 192.1
million as of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively. Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, included in deferred revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 28, 2022,
was $ 29.7
million and $ 154.7
million,
respectively. As of February 4, 2021, a fair value adjustment of $ 60.7
million was recorded to reduce our deferred revenue to its fair value as part of the Business Combination. As deferred revenue is recognized, any fair value adjustment related to the deferred revenue is also recognized as a reduction to revenue. As of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the fair value adjustment to reduce deferred revenue as part of the Business Combinatio n was $ 0.1
million and $ 0.5
million, r espectively. With the early adoption of ASU 2021-08, a fair value adjustment to deferred revenue is no longer required; therefore, an adjustment to deferred revenue was not made for the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions. Sales Commissions With the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40,
Contracts with Customers
in March 2019, we began deferring and amortizing sales commissions that are incremental and directly related to obtaining client contracts. 26
Amortization expen se of $ 1.0
million and $ 0.5
million was recorded in sales and marketing expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. Amortization expense of $ 2.9
million and $ 0.9
million was recorded in sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Certain sales commissions that would have an amortization period of less than one year are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, we had
a total of $ 14.3
million
and $ 12.2
million of capitalized sales commissions included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.
18.	Severance and Exit Costs In connection with acquisitions, we conduct pre and post-acquisition related operational reviews to reallocate resources to strategic areas of the business. The operational reviews resulted in workforce reductions, lease obligations related to properties that were vacated and other expenses.
Severance and exit costs included in acquisition-related expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows:

In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we accrued $ 0.8
million in severance expense related to an executive who left the Company. The expense was recorded in general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accrued severance and retention liability. The severance payment was paid during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 was a restructuring liability balance, primarily consisting of lease related obligatio ns, of $ 0.2
million and
$ 0.8
million, respectively, and a restructuring severance liabil ity of $ 2.5
million and
$ 1.9
million, respectively. We expect these amounts to be substantially paid within the next 12 months. The following table reflects the changes in the severance and exit cost accruals from March 1, 2022 through

19.	Warrants As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, there were an aggregate
of
29,079,872
warran ts outstanding, which include the public warrants, private placement warrants and Forward Purchase Warrants. Each warrant entitles its holders to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50
per share. The private placement warrants became exercisable with the Domestication. The Forward Purchase Warrants became exercisable upon the effectiveness of our Form S-1 in March 2021. The public warrants became exercisable in
April 2021 . The public warrants, private placement warrants and Forward Purchase Warrants expire
five years
after the Closing Date, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Once the warrants became exercisable, we have the option to redeem the outstanding warrants when various conditions are met, such as specific stock prices, as detailed in the specific warrant agreements. However, the
10,280,000
private placement warrants are nonredeemable so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees. The warrants are recorded as a liability in warrant liability on the Condensed Co nsolidated Balance Sheets with a balance of $ 30.4
million and $ 67.1
million as of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively. During the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 , a gain of $ 16.2
million and a loss of $ 7.2
million was recognized in gain (loss) from change in fair value of the warrant liability in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. During the nine months ended
November 30, 2022 and 2021 , a gain of $ 36.8
million and loss of $ 48.4
million was recognized in gain (loss) from change in fair value of the warrant liability, respectively.

per share. In August 2021, the number of shares authorized for issuance increased to
42,747,890
Class V common stock with a par value of $ 0.0001 .
These shares have no economic value but entitle the holder to one vote per share . As of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 , there were
33,092,007
and
33,560,839
shares of Class V Common Stock issued and outstanding, respectively, and

Commo n Units that were converted into cash instead of stock at our option. Class V Common Stock are retired on a one-for-one basis when Common Units are converted into Class A Common Stock or settled in cash. (2) The Class A Common Stock withheld for taxes revert back to the 2021 Incentive Plan, as defined below, and are used for future grants. Share Repurchase Program On January 20, 2022, the board of directors approved a $ 100.0
million share repurchase program (2022 Share Repurchase Program). Stock repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program is subject to market conditions and other factors and does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of our Class A Common Stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time, without prior notice. We will record all share repurchases based on the trade date. Shares of our Class A Common Stock repurchased under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program will be recorded as treasury stock, at cost, but may from time to time be retired. No
shares of Class A Common Stock have been repurchased to date.
21.	Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interest represents the portion of E2open Holdings that we control and consolidate but do not own. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the noncontrolling interests represe nt a
9.9 % and
10.0 % ownership in E2open Holdings, respectively. As part of the Business Combination, E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. became the owner of E2open Holdings along with the existing owners of E2open Holdings through Common Unit ownership. The existing owners of E2open Holdings are shown as noncontrolling interests on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and their portion of the net income (loss) of E2open Holdings is shown as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 28
Generally, Common Units participate in net income or loss allocations and distributions and entitle their holder to the right, subject to the terms set forth in the limited liability agreement, to require E2open Holdings to redeem all or a portion of the Common Units held by such participant. At our option, we may satisfy this redemption with cash or by exchanging Class V Common Stock for Class A Common Stock on a
one -for- one
basis. During the three months ended November 30, 2022 ,
100,000
Com mon Units were converted into Class A Common Stock with a value of
$ 0.6
mi llion based off the 5-day VWAP. During the nine months ended November 30, 2022,
249,941
Common Units were converted into Class A Common Stock with a value of
$ 1.8
m illion based off the 5-day VWAP. A total of
218,891
Common Units were settled in cash of $ 1.4
million during the nine months ended
November 30, 2022. This activity resulted in a decrease to noncontrolling interests of $ 0.6
million and $ 3.2
million during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, respectively. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, there were a total o f
33.1
mil lion and
33.6
million Common Units held by participants of E2open Holdings, respectively. We follow the guidance issued by the FASB regarding the classification and measurement of redeemable securities. Accordingly, we have determined that the Common Units meet the requirements to be classified as permanent equity.

We did not reclass any items to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2021.   Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to net income (loss) when realized upon sale or upon complete, or substantially complete, liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity.   See Note 15,

23.	Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated as net income (loss) divided by the average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share assumes, when dilutive, the issuance of the net incremental shares from options and restricted shares.
The following is a reconciliation of the denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations for net income (loss):

24.	Share-Based Compensation 2021 Incentive Plan The E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2021 Incentive Plan) became effective on the Closing Date with the approval of CCNB1's shareholders and board of directors. The 2021 Incentive Plan allows us to make equity and equity-based incentive awards to officers, employees, directors and consultants. There were
15,000,000
shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Incentive Plan as of
February 28, 2022 . The "evergreen" provision of the 2021 Incentive Plan provides for an annual automatic increase to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock available under the plan. As of March 1, 2022, an additional
4,849,684
shares were reserved for issuance under the "evergreen " provision. Shares issued under the 2021 Incentive Plan can be granted as stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock awards, cash awards and other equity-based awards. No award may vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date of grant, expect under limited conditions. Our board of directors have approved the grant of options and RSUs under the 2021 Incentive Plan.
The fiscal year 2022 options were performance based and measured based on obtaining an organic growth target over a
one-year
period with a quarter of the options vesting at the end of the performance period and the remaining options vesting equally over the following
three years . The fiscal year 2023 options are performance based and measured based on obtaining organic growth, adjusted EBITDA and net booking targets over a
one-year
period with a quarter of the options vesting at the end of the performance period and the remaining options vesting equally over the following
three years . Our executive officers and senior management are granted these performance based options. The performance target is set at
100 % at the grant date, and the probability of meeting the performance target is remeasured each quarter over the performance period and adjusted if needed. The performance target for the options granted during May 2021 was finalized in April 2022 above
100 % and adjusted accordingly. As of
November 30, 2022, there w ere
4,259,741
unveste d performance based options. The RSUs are either performance based or time based. The fiscal year 2022 performance based RSUs were measured based on obtaining an organic growth target over a
one-year
period with a quarter of the RSUs vesting at the end of the performance period and the remaining RSUs vesting equally over the following
three years . The fiscal year 2023 performance based RSUs are measured based on obtaining an organic growth, adjusted EBITDA and net bookings target over a
one-year
period with a quarter of the RSUs vesting at the end of the performance period and the remaining RSUs vesting equally over the following
three years . The performance target is set at
100 % at the date of grant, and the probability of meeting the performance target is remeasured each quarter over the performance period and adjusted if needed. The performance target for the performance based RSUs granted during May 2021 was finalized in April 2022 above
100 % and adjusted accordingly. The time based RSUs for executive officers, senior management and employees vest ratably over a
three-year
period while the time based RSUs for non-employee directors of our board of directors have a
one-year
vesting period. As of
November 30, 2022, there
were
2,051,628
performance based RSUs and
4,566,069
time
based RSUs that were vested or expected to vest with a total intrinsic value of
$ 39.0
m illion. During fiscal 2023 our board of directors approved a company-wide share-based compensation program under our 2021 Incentive Plan. Under the program, approximately
3,800
employees are eligible to receive an annual stock award subject to approval by the board of directors as part of their annual compensation package. As part of the fiscal 2023 annual compensation package, our board of directors approved a grant on October 1, 2022 of
1,653,982
time based RSUs to the employees who had not previously received a fiscal year 2023 equity grant. For those employees based in China,
25,045
cash-settled RSUs w ere granted. The time based and cash-settled RSUs will vest ratably over a
three-year
period. The cash-settled RSUs must be settled in cash and are accounted for as liability-type awards. The fair value of these cash-settled RSUs equals the value of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant and is remeasured at the end of each reporting period at fair value. The change in fair value will be recorded in share-based compensation expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The liability for the cash-settled RSUs was negligible as of November 30, 2022 and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 30, 2022, there wer e
25,045
unv ested cash-settled RSUs with a total intrinsic value of
$ 0.1
mi llion. As of November 30, 2022, there w ere
8,444,185
shares of Class A Commo n Stock available for grant under the 2021 Incentive Plan. As previously disclosed in our 2022 Form
10-K in Item 9B.,
Other Information , our former Chief Financial Officer entered into a Transition Agreement in which all of his outstanding stock awards accelerated vesting to August 31, 2022. Additionally, the exercise period for his options was extended from 90 days to one year with exercises permitted through August 31, 2023 . 31

25.	Leases We account for leases in accordance with ASC 842,
Leases
which requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets on the balance sheet for most operating leases. We made the accounting policy election not to apply the recognition provisions of ASC 842 to short-term leases which are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Instead, we recognize the lease payments for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease liabilities reflect our obligation to make future lease payments for real estate locations. Lease terms are comprised of contractual terms. Payments are discounted using the rate we would pay to borrow amounts equal to the lease payments over the lease term (our incremental borrowing rate). We do not separate lease and non-lease components for contracts in which we are the lessee. ROU assets are measured based on lease liabilities adjusted for incentives and timing differences between operating lease expense and payments, recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are recognized as incurred. Common area maintenance and other executory costs are the main components of variable lease payments. Operating and variable lease expenses are recorded in general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Real Estate Leases We lease our primary office space under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates thr ough
June 2030 . Many o f our leases have an
option to be extended
from
two
to
five years , and several of the leases give us the right to cancel early with proper notification. Additionally, we ha ve
two
subleases
of our office leases as of
November 30, 2022. Several of the operating lease agreements require us to provide security deposits. As of November 30, 2022, and February 28, 2022, lease deposits were
$ 5.0
mi llion and $ 3.6
million, respectively. The deposits are generally refundable at the expiration of the lease, assuming all obligations under the lease agreement have been met. Deposits are included in prepaid and other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 33
During the three and nine months ended November 2022, we incur red a $ 1.8
million and $ 4.1
million impair ment, respectively, on our operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements due to vacating three and seven locations, respectively, with the intent to sublease them. The impairments were recorded in general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Vehicle Leases We lease vehicles under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements which have various expiration dates th rough
October 2026 . We
do not have the right to purchase the vehicles at the end of the lease term. Equipment Leases We purchase certain equipment under non-cancelable financing lease arrangements which are primarily related to software and computer equipment and which have various expiration date s through
October 2023 . We have the right to purchas e the software and computer equipment anytime during the lease or upon lease completion. Balance Sheet Presentation The following tables present the amounts and classifications of our estimated ROU assets, net and lease liabilities:

26.	Income Taxes We calculate the provision for income taxes during interim periods by applying an estimate of the forecasted annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to "ordinary" income or loss (pretax income or loss excluding discrete items) for the reporting period. Our provision for income taxes was a benefit of $ 7.9
million, or
331.8 %, for the three months ended
November 30, 2022
compared to a benefit of $ 10.8
million, or
14.3 %, for the three months ended
November 30, 2021. Our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended November 30, 2022
was a benefit of $ 130.0
million, or
23.8 %, compared to a benefit of $ 3.4
million, or
1.3 %, for the nine months ended
November 30, 2021. The loss before income taxes of
$ 2.4
m illion and $ 546.7
million for the three and nine months ended
November 30, 2022, respectfully, resulted in a
$ 7.9
millio n and $ 130.0
million income tax benefit, respectively. These benefits primarily resulted from the goodwill impairment taken in the second fiscal quarter of 2023. Additionally, the increase in the tax benefit was due to changes in the impact of book income and losses of affiliates on the carrying amount of our partnership investment and changes in the mark-to-market gains and losses on certain contingent liabilities offset by changes in book losses in certain jurisdictions for which no benefit can be recognized. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, total gr oss unrecognized tax benefits were $ 2.6
million. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of
November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022 , the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was less than $ 0.1
million which is classified as other noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 35
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. The alternative minimum tax is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 and the excise tax applies to stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. The alternative minimum tax would not be applicable in our next fiscal year as it is based on a three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1 billion. We will evaluate any impact related to the excise tax on net stock repurchases based on our relative activity.
27.	Commitments and Contingencies From time to time, we are subject to contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not currently believe the resolution of any such contingencies will have a material adverse effect upon our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations or Statements of Cash Flows.

Recent Events
On March 2, 2022, E2open, LLC acquired Logistyx for a purchase price of $185 million, with an estimated fair value of $183.4 million, including $90 million paid in cash at closing. An additional $95 million was paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and September 1, 2022. We had the option to finance the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment of $37.4 million was paid in cash. On September 1, 2022, E2open, LLC made a cash payment of $54.0 million to Logistyx as the final installment payment for the Logistyx Acquisition which reflected a working capital adjustment of $3.6 million. The Logistyx sellers disputed the working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement. During October 2022, the parties agreed to a working capital adjustment of $2.6 million with the additional payment for working capital made to Logistyx on December 5, 2022.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the market price of our Class A Common Stock and market capitalization declined significantly. This decline resulted in a triggering event, as such an interim goodwill impairment assessment was performed. We calculated the fair value of E2open under three different methods: discounted cash flow method, guideline public company method and guideline transaction method. The discounted cash flow method was based on the present value of estimated future cash flows which were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and net operating income margins, taking into consideration market and industry conditions. Under the guideline public company method, the fair value was based on forward-looking earnings multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar market position and size. Under the guideline transaction method, the fair value was based on pricing multiples derived from recently sold companies with similar characteristics to ours. The three approaches generated similar results and indicated that the fair value of E2open's equity and goodwill was less than its carrying amount. Therefore, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $514.8 million to goodwill. See Note 7,

Subscriptions revenue was $134.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, a $27.9 million, or 26%, increase compared to subscriptions revenue of $107.0 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The increase in subscriptions revenue was primarily due to the Logistyx Acquisition and new organic subscription sales predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our current client portfolio, as well as the $10.4 million amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. With the early adoption of ASU 2021-08, a fair value adjustment to deferred revenue for the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions was not recorded; therefore, amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue similar to the Business Combination adjustment did not occur for the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions.
Professional services and other revenue was flat between periods at $30.0 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. The increase in professional services and other revenue was a result of the Logistyx Acquisition offset by lower revenue driven by our strategic focus on system integrator partnership initiatives, incremental data subscription sales and macroeconomic impact from the technology sector.
Our subscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 82% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 78% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The third quarter of fiscal 2022 included $10.4 million amortization related to the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination, reducing subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue for that period.

Cost of subscriptions was $35.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, a $5.8 million, or 19%, increase compared to $30.2 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by a $3.9 million increase in software and hosting costs, predominately related to the Logistyx Acquisition.

Cost of professional services and other revenue was $20.4 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, a $2.8 million, or 16%, increase compared to $17.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021. Personnel costs such as salaries increased $1.1 million, primarily due to the Logistyx Acquisition in March 2022. Additionally, consulting expenses increased $2.3 million when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by our investment in strategic system integrator partnership initiatives.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $24.4 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, a $0.6 million, or 3%, decrease compared to $25.0 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021, driven primarily by the Logistyx Acquisition in March 2022.
Our subscriptions gross margin was 55% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 48% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to the $10.4 million amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination in fiscal 2022 offset by the additional revenue from the Logistyx Acquisition in fiscal 2023. With the early adoption of ASU 2021-08, the BluJay and Logistyx deferred revenue was recorded under ASC 606 and not at fair value at the acquisition date; therefore, amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue similar to the Business Combination adjustment did not occur for the BluJay or Logistyx acquisitions.
Our professional services gross margin was down for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 at 32% compared to 41% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to our investment in strategic system integrator partnership initiatives.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we incurred a $1.8 million impairment on our operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements due to vacating locations with the intent to sublease them. This increase was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in personnel costs such as salaries and incentive compensation compared to the prior year period and $1.1 million decrease due to the BluJay Acquisition in September 2021.

During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we recorded a gain of $2.7 million related to the change in the fair value of the tax receivable agreement liability, including interest, compared to a $1.5 million expense during the three months ended November 30, 2021. Pursuant to ASC 805,
Business Combination
and relevant tax law, we calculated the fair value of the tax receivable agreement payments and identified the timing of the utilization of the tax attributes. The tax receivable agreement liability, related to exchanges as of the Business Combination date, is revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss as well as the associated interest reflected in gain (loss) from change in tax receivable agreement liability in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the event occurred.
In addition, under ASC 450, transactions with partnership unit holders after the acquisition date will result in additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities that are recorded on a gross undiscounted basis. During the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 increased by $0.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively.

Loss before income taxes was $2.4 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, a $72.7 million decrease compared to $75.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The decrease in the loss was primarily related to a $19.9 million higher gross profit due to the Logistyx Acquisition and a decrease in the amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination as well as a $31.2 million reduction in acquisition and other related expenses due to the BluJay Acquisition in September 2021. Additionally, there was a $23.4 million increase in the gain associated with the change in the fair value of the warrant liability and a $7.4 million increase in the gain associated with the fair value adjustments for the fair contingent consideration liability related to the restricted Series B-2 common stock and Series 2 RCUs when compared to the prior year. These gains were partially offset by $10.5 million of higher interest expense.
Income tax benefit was $7.9 million, or 331.8%, for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $10.8 million, or 14.3%, for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The change in our effective tax rate between periods was due to changes in the impact of book income and losses of affiliates on the carrying amount of our partnership investment, year-over-year changes in book losses in certain jurisdictions for which no benefit can be recognized and changes in the mark-to-market gains and losses on certain contingent liabilities. For the three months ended November 30, 2021, in accordance with ASC 740-20-45-11, we accounted for the tax effect of the step-up in income tax basis related to transactions with or among shareholders and recognized a deferred tax asset and corresponding increase in stockholders' equity of $36.8 million.

The increase in subscriptions revenue was primarily due to the BluJay Acquisition, Logistyx Acquisition and new organic subscription sales predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our current client portfolio, as well as the $47.1 million amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. With the early adoption of ASU 2021-08, a fair value adjustment to deferred revenue for the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions was not recorded; therefore, amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue similar to the Business Combination adjustment did not occur for the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions.

This increase was primarily driven by $28.3 million related to the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions and an increase in personnel costs for items such as salaries and incentive compensation. Additionally, there was an increase of $13.9 million for software and hosting costs. Most of this increase related to the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions.
Cost of professional services and other revenue was $63.4 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a $24.8 million, or 64%, increase compared to $38.7 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The BluJay Acquisition in fiscal 2022, Logistyx Acquisition in fiscal 2023, increased personnel costs such as salaries and incentive compensation, our investment in strategic system integrator partnership initiatives and increased travel accounted for $24.1 million of the increase in the cost of professional services and other revenue.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $73.9 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a $25.0 million, or 51%, increase compared to $48.9 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2021, driven by the BluJay Acquisition in September 2021 and Logistyx Acquisition in March 2022.
Our subscriptions gross margin was 55% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 as compared to 49% for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 primarily due to the amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination offset by the additional revenue from the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions in fiscal 2023.

Our professional services gross margin was down to 29% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to 37% for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 primarily due to our investment in strategic system integrator partnership initiatives.

Research and development expenses were $73.1 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a $16.2 million, or 28%, increase compared to $56.9 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $13.6 million related to the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions as well as major strategic partnership initiatives around product development efforts during fiscal year 2023, which resulted in net increased personnel costs such as salaries and incentive compensation and consulting expenses as compared to the prior year period. Additionally, there was an increase of $1.0 million for software and hosting costs.

Sales and marketing expenses were $67.3 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a $25.6 million, or 61%, increase compared to $41.8 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a $21.8 million increase due to the BluJay Acquisition in fiscal 2022 and Logistyx Acquisition in fiscal 2023 as well as additional expenses associated with our new corporate branding, digital and social marketing related to the launch of our new brand and website, company store and integrated marketing experience as well as hiring additional marketing resources. Additionally, there was an increase of $1.6 million for travel and entertainment and $1.1 million in share-based compensation.

The increase was primarily attributable to $8.4 million related to the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions. Additionally, there was an increase of $2.7 million for share-based compensation. During fiscal 2023, we incurred a $4.1 million impairment on our operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements due to vacating locations with the intent to sublease them.

The decrease was mainly related to legal and consulting expenses associated with the Logistyx Acquisition in fiscal 2023 and BluJay Acquisition in fiscal 2022.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $62.5 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a $35.7 million increase, compared to $26.8 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The increase was a result of the BluJay Acquisition in September 2021 and Logistyx Acquisition in March 2022.

Goodwill Impairment
As indicated above, the market price of our Class A Common Stock and market capitalization declined significantly during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This decline resulted in us determining that a triggering event occurred and an interim goodwill impairment assessment was performed. The result of the impairment assessment was the realization of a $514.8 million impairment charge. We did not have an impairment charge in the prior year.

During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we recorded a gain of $9.1 million related to the change in the fair value of the tax receivable agreement liability, including interest, compared to a $4.6 million expense during the nine months ended November 30, 2021. Pursuant to ASC 805,
Business Combination
and relevant tax law, we calculated the fair value of the tax receivable agreement payments and identified the timing of the utilization of the tax attributes. The tax receivable agreement liability, related to exchanges as of the Business Combination date, is revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss as well as the associated interest reflected in gain (loss) from change in tax receivable agreement liability in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the event occurred.
In addition, under ASC 450, transactions with partnership unit holders after the acquisition date will result in additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities that are recorded on a gross undiscounted basis. During the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 increased by $0.7 million and $13.2 million, respectively.

Loss before income taxes was $546.7 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a $285.7 million increase compared to $261.0 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. This increase in the loss was primarily related to the $514.8 million impairment on goodwill taken in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The remaining increase was related to $58.3 million of higher operating expenses, $32.7 million of higher interest expense and a $35.7 million increase in the amortization of the intangible assets when compared to the prior year. These expenses were partially offset by a $112.4 million higher gross profit due to the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions along with a decrease in the amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination of $47.1 million. Additionally, there was a $85.2 million gain on the change in the fair value adjustments for the warrant liability and a $108.9 million gain associated with the fair value adjustments for the contingent consideration liability related to the restricted Series B-2 common stock and Series 2 RCUs when compared to the prior year.
Income tax benefit was $130.0 million, or 23.8%, for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $3.4 million, or 1.3%, for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The change in our effective tax rate between periods was primarily due to the reduction in our deferred tax liability as a result of the goodwill impairment, year-over-year changes in book losses in certain jurisdictions for which no benefit can be recognized, changes in the impact of book income and losses of affiliates on the carrying amount of our partnership investment, and changes in the mark-to-market gains and losses on certain contingent liabilities.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP subscriptions revenue, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP performance measures that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.
We calculate and define Non-GAAP revenue and Non-GAAP subscriptions revenue as revenue excluding the impact of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination. We calculate and define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items. We define and calculate EBITDA as net income or losses excluding interest income or expense, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the following items: amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, goodwill impairment charge, right-of-use assets charge, transaction-related costs, gain (loss) from change in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items as described in the reconciliation below. We also report Non-GAAP gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Non-GAAP revenue as additional measures to evaluate financial performance.
46
We include these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain expenses that are required in accordance with U.S. GAAP because they are non-recurring (for example, in the case of transaction-related costs, goodwill impairment charge, right-of-use assets charge and amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment), non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation, amortization, gain (loss) from change in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of interest income and expense). There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in the U.S. GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from U.S. GAAP financial measures such as net income or loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Non-GAAP revenue was $486.0 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a $157.4 million, or 48%, increase compared to $328.5 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The increase in Non-GAAP revenue was mainly due to the $129.2 million increase in our subscriptions revenue related to the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions and new organic sales driven by increases in products utilized across our current client portfolio. Additionally, $28.2 million of the increase was due to an increase in our professional services revenue primarily related to the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions.

The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions as well as the decrease in the amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination of $47.1 million. Gross margin was 50% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to 47% for the first nine months of fiscal 2022.

EBITDA was a loss of $334.5 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a $187.1 million increase compared to a loss of $147.4 million for nine months ended November 30, 2021. EBITDA margins were a negative 69% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to a negative 52% in the prior year. The decrease in EBITDA and EBITDA margin was primarily related to the $514.8 million goodwill impairment taken in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This expense was partially offset by a decrease of $47.1 million in the amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination. Additionally, there was a $35.8 million decrease in acquisition related expenses, higher revenues in fiscal 2023, a $85.2 million higher gain for the fair value adjustment for the warrant liability and a $108.9 million higher gain associated with the fair value adjustment for the contingent consideration liability related to the restricted Series B-2 common stock when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA margin was 32% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to 33% for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 primarily due to a lower gross margin driven by our investment in strategic system integrator partnership initiatives as well as increased hosting and labor costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital, capital expenditure needs, contractual obligations and other commitments, with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Current working capital needs relate mainly to employee compensation and benefits, as well as interest and debt. Our ability to expand and grow our business will depend on many factors, including working capital needs and the evolution of our operating cash flows.
We had $85.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $145.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of November 30, 2022. See Note 13,
Notes Payable
to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, the borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt repayment, capital expenditure requirements and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.
In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing.
51
Share Repurchase Program
On January 20, 2022, our board of directors approved the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. Share repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to other Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program is subject to market conditions and other factors and does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A Common Stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time, without prior notice. We plan to fund this program with cash on hand.
No shares of Class A Common Stock have been repurchased to date.
Debt
2021 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility
In February 2021, E2open, LLC, our subsidiary, entered into the Credit Agreement which provided for the 2021 Term Loan in the amount of $525.0 million and the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility for $75.0 million. In September 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended to include a $380.0 million incremental term loan, an increase in the letter of credit sublimit from $15.0 million to $30.0 million and an increase in the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $155.0 million. On April 6, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to include a $190.0 million incremental term loan.
The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will mature on February 4, 2026. E2open, LLC can request increases in the revolving commitments and additional term loan facilities, in minimum amounts of $2.0 million for each facility. Principal payments are due on the Credit Agreement the last day of February, May, August and November commencing August 2021. The Credit Agreement was payable in quarterly installments of $1.3 million beginning in August 2021; however, the payments were increased to $2.3 million with the addition of the incremental term loan beginning in November 2021. The payment increased to $2.7 million with the addition of the $190.0 million incremental term loan beginning in May 2022. The Credit Agreement is payable in full on February 4, 2028.
The 2021 Term Loan has a variable interest rate which was 6.64% and 4.00% as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively. As of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the 2021 Term Loan had a principal balance outstanding of $1,080.9 million and $899.2 million, respectively. There were $10.0 million outstanding borrowings at an interest rate of 6.77%, no letters of credit and $145.0 million available borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of November 30, 2022. These borrowings were used for general operating activities. There were $80.0 million of borrowings outstanding at an interest rate of 5.25%, no outstanding letters of credit and $75.0 million available borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2022.
On January 9, 2023, we repaid the outstanding $10.0 million balance on our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. After this repayment, our available borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility is $155.0 million.
The average interest rate on our 2021 Term Loan was impacted by changes in market interest rates, which was attributed to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve repeatedly raising their target benchmark interest rate in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, resulting in subsequent prime rate increases of 375 basis points between March and November 2022. Based on our current outstanding 2021 Term Loan, this increase would result in an additional $40.5 million of interest expense per year.

Nine Months Ended November 30, 2022 compared to Nine Months Ended November 30, 2021
As of November 30, 2022, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $98.8 million, a $75.7 million decrease from our balance of $174.6 million as of February 28, 2022.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 was $43.2 million compared to $28.2 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The $15.0 million increase in cash was primarily driven by the additional gross profits contributed by BluJay and Logistyx as well as organic growth partially offset by the use of $86.3 million of cash for working capital items such as the decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable, the increase in cash for accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the recognition of deferred revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2022.
Net cash used in investing activities was $222.7 million and $798.9 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During fiscal year 2023, net cash of $179.2 million was used for the Logistyx Acquisition while $774.2 million of cash was used for the BluJay Acquisition during fiscal 2022. Additionally, we made a $3.0 million minority investment in a private firm during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. During the nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, $40.5 million and $24.6 million were used for the acquisition of software and property related to our data centers, respectively.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 was $103.4 million compared to $633.0 million for nine months ended November 30, 2021. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was mainly due to the following:
• We received $300.0 million in PIPE investment proceeds and obtained additional borrowings of $380.0 million for the BluJay Acquisition under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility in fiscal 2022 compared to the $190.0 million incremental term loan for the Logistyx Acquisition in fiscal 2023;
• During fiscal 2023 we borrowed an additional $10.0 million and repaid $80.0 million more on the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility when compared to fiscal 2022;
• We paid an additional $4.5 million on the 2021 Term Loan during fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022;
• During fiscal 2023, we paid $4.8 million in debt issuance costs related to the $190.0 million term loan compared to $10.4 million in debt issuance costs related to the additional borrowings in fiscal 2022;
• We paid an additional $15.4 million more for the repurchase of Common Units upon conversion to cash during fiscal 2022 than we did in fiscal 2023;
• During fiscal 2022, we paid $2.5 million for the repurchase of common stock to pay withholding taxes; and
• We paid $7.1 million of offering costs associated with the PIPE investment financing during fiscal 2022.
Tax Receivable Agreement
Concurrently with the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with certain selling equity holders of E2open Holdings that requires us to pay 85% of the tax savings that are realized because of increases in the tax basis of E2open Holdings' assets. This increase is either from the sale of Common Units or exchange of Common Units for shares of Class A Common Stock and cash, as well as tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur.
Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be contingent upon, among other things, our generation of taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we would not be required to make the related payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although the amount of any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year.
53
The liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement was $58.2 million and $66.6 million as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively, assuming (1) a corporate tax rate of 24.2% as of November 30, 2022 and 24.1% as of February 28, 2022, (2) no dispositions of corporate subsidiaries, (3) no material changes in tax law and (4) we do not elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, due to the uncertainty of various factors, including: (a) the timing and value of future exchanges, (b) the amount and timing of our future taxable income, (c) changes in our tax rate, (d) no future dispositions of any corporate stock, (e) changes in the tax law and (f) changes in the discount rate, the likely tax savings we will realize and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay to the selling equity holders of E2open Holdings pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement are uncertain. Additionally, interest will accrue on the portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability recorded under ASC 805 at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 is recorded on a gross undiscounted basis.
The liability recorded on the balance sheet does not include an estimate of the amount of payments to be made if certain sellers exchanged their remaining interests in E2open Holdings for our common stock, as this amount is not readily determinable and is dependent on several future variables, including timing of future exchanges, stock price at date of exchange, tax attributes of the individual parties to the exchange and changes in future applicable federal and state tax rates.
In addition, if we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur, we will be required to make immediate cash payments. Such cash payments will be equal to the present value of the assumed future realized tax benefits based on a set of assumptions and using an agreed upon discount rate, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits. Such payments will be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that we have sufficient taxable income to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement over the period specified therein. The payments that we would be required to make will generally reduce the amount of the overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related tax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments.
We are entitled to receive quarterly tax distributions from E2open Holdings, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law and contractual restrictions. The cash received from such tax distributions will first be used to satisfy any tax liability and then make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect that such tax distributions will be sufficient to fund both our tax liability and the required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
Contingent Consideration
The contingent consideration liability was $27.8 million and $45.6 million as of November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a gain of $6.3 million and loss of $1.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a gain of $17.8 million and a loss of $91.2 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The contingent liability represents the Series B-1 common stock, Series B-2 common stock, Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs.
As of June 8, 2021, the Series B-1 common stock and Series 1 RCUs were no longer reflected as a contingent consideration liability as the 5-day VWAP of our Class A Common Stock exceeded $13.50 per share. This triggering event resulted in the 8,120,273 Series B-1 common stock converting into Class A Common Stock and 4,379,557 Series 1 RCUs becoming 4,379,557 Common Units of E2open Holdings along with entitling the holders of the newly vested common units to 4,379,557 shares of Class V Common Stock.
Logistyx Acquisition
On March 2, 2022, E2open, LLC acquired Logistyx for a purchase price of $185 million, and an estimated fair value of $183.4 million, including $90 million paid in cash at closing. An additional $95 million was paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and September 1, 2022. We had the option to finance the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment of $37.4 million was paid with cash. On September 1, 2022, E2open, LLC made a cash payment of $54.0 million to Logistyx as the final installment payment for the Logistyx Acquisition which reflected a working capital adjustment of $3.6 million. The Logistyx sellers disputed the working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement. During October 2022, the parties agreed to a working capital adjustment of $2.6 million. The additional payment for working capital was made to Logistyx on December 5, 2022.
Leases
We account for leases in accordance with ASC 842,
Leases
which requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets on the balance sheet for contracts that provide lessees with the right to control the use of identified assets for periods of greater than 12 months.
54
Our non-cancelable operating leases for our office spaces and vehicles have various expiration dates through June 2030. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of November 30, 2022 were: $2.6
million for December 1, 2022 through February 28, 2023, $8.9 million for fiscal 2024, $7.0 million for fiscal 2025, $4.4 million for fiscal 2026, $3.0 million for fiscal 2027 and $2.5 million thereafter. These numbers include interest of $2.7 million.
Our non-cancelable financing lease arrangements relate to software and computer equipment and have various expiration dates through October 2023. We have the right to purchase the software and computer equipment anytime during the lease or upon lease completion. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of November 30, 2022 were: $0.1 million for December 1, 2022 through February 28, 2023 and $2.0 million for fiscal 2024. These numbers include interest of $0.1 million.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K.
There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022 from those previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7,

Item 4 . Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have disclosure controls and procedures in place to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. These controls and procedures are accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report. In designing and evaluating these disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
55
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We review our disclosure controls and procedures, which may include internal controls over financial reporting, on an ongoing basis. From time to time, management makes changes to enhance the effectiveness of these controls and ensure that they continue to meet the needs of our business over time.
PART II—Other
Information
Item 1 . Legal Proceedings.
From time to time, we are subject to contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not currently believe the resolution of any such contingencies will have a material adverse effect upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations or Statements of Cash Flows.
Item 1A . Risk Factors.
There have been no material changes in our risk factors during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022 from those previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A.,
Risk Factors
of our 2022 Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our 2022 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On January 20, 2022, the board of directors approved a $100.0 million share repurchase program (2022 Share Repurchase Program). Stock repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program is subject to market conditions and other factors and does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of our Class A Common Stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time, without prior notice.
No shares of Class A Common Stock have been repurchased to date.
