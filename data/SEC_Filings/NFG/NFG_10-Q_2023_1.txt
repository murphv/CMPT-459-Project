Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles of Consolidation.
The Company consolidates all entities in which it has a controlling financial interest.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
The Company uses proportionate consolidation when accounting for drilling arrangements related to oil and gas producing properties accounted for under the full cost method of accounting.       The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. Earnings for Interim Periods.
The Company, in its opinion, has included all adjustments (which consist of only normally recurring adjustments, unless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the reported periods. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 that are included in the Company's 2022 Form 10-K.  The consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023 will be audited by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm after the end of the fiscal year.       The earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2022 should not be taken as a prediction of earnings for the entire fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.  Most of the business of the Utility segment is seasonal in nature and is influenced by weather conditions.  Due to the seasonal nature of the heating business in the Utility segment, earnings during the winter months normally represent a substantial part of the earnings that this business is expected to achieve for the entire fiscal year.  The Company’s business segments are discussed more fully in Note 9 – Business Segment Information.
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The components, as reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, of the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash presented on the Statement of Cash Flows are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended  December 31, 2022 Three Months Ended  December 31, 2021   Balance at
December 31, 2022 Balance at October 1, 2022 Balance at
December 31, 2021 Balance at October 1, 2021 Cash and Temporary Cash Investments $ 244,475   $ 46,048   $ 79,065   $ 31,528   Hedging Collateral Deposits 1,600   91,670   —   88,610   Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash $ 246,075   $ 137,718   $ 79,065   $ 120,138       The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity date of generally three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’s restricted cash is composed entirely of amounts reported as Hedging Collateral Deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Hedging Collateral Deposits is an account title for cash held in margin accounts funded by the Company to serve as collateral for derivative financial instruments in an unrealized loss position.
In accordance with its accounting policy, the Company does not offset hedging collateral deposits paid or received against related derivative financial instruments liability or asset balances. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.
The allowance for uncollectible accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable.
The allowance, the majority of which is in the Utility segment, is determined based on historical experience, the age of customer accounts, other specific information about customer accounts, and the economic and regulatory environment.
Account balances are charged off against the allowance approximately twelve months after the account is final billed or when it is anticipated that the receivable will not be recovered.
11 Table of Contents      Activity in the allowance for uncollectible accounts for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Additions Charged to Costs and Expenses Discounts on Purchased Receivables Net Accounts Receivable Recovered (Written-Off) Balance at End of Period Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts $ 40,228   $ 5,035   $ 228   $ ( 1,566 ) $ 43,925   Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts $ 31,639   $ 3,742   $ 161   $ 57   $ 35,599   Gas Stored Underground.
In the Utility segment, gas stored underground is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value, on a LIFO method.  Gas stored underground normally declines during the first and second quarters of the year and is replenished during the third and fourth quarters.  In the Utility segment, the current cost of replacing gas withdrawn from storage is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and a reserve for gas replacement is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption “Other Accruals and Current Liabilities.”  Such reserve, which amounted to $ 17.7
million at December 31, 2022, is reduced to
zero
by September 30 of each year as the inventory is replenished. Property, Plant and Equipment.
In the Company’s Exploration and Production segment, oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting. Under this methodology, all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized, including internal costs directly identified with acquisition, exploration and development activities. The internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead, or similar activities. The Company does not recognize any gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center.
The Company's capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, were $ 2.1
billion and $ 1.9
billion at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
Capitalized costs include costs related to unproved properties, which are excluded from amortization until proved reserves are found or it is determined that the unproved properties are impaired.  Such costs amounted to $ 67.5
million and $ 66.0
million at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.  All costs related to unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the pool of capitalized costs being amortized.       Capitalized costs are subject to the SEC full cost ceiling test. The ceiling test, which is performed each quarter, determines a limit, or ceiling, on the amount of property acquisition, exploration and development costs that can be capitalized. The ceiling under this test represents (a) the present value of estimated future net cash flows, excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet, using a discount factor of
10 %, which is computed by applying prices of oil and gas (as adjusted for hedging) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet, less estimated future expenditures, plus (b) the cost of unproved properties not being depleted, less (c) income tax effects related to the differences between the book and tax basis of the properties. The gas and oil prices used to calculate the full cost ceiling are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil and gas prices for each month within the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period.
If capitalized costs, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the ceiling at the end of any quarter, a permanent non-cash impairment is required to be charged to earnings in that quarter.
At December 31, 2022, the ceiling exceeded the book value of the oil and gas properties by approximately $ 3.3
billion.  The estimated future net cash flows were decreased by $ 954.3
million for hedging under the ceiling test at December 31, 2022.          The principal assets of the Utility, Pipeline and Storage and Gathering segments, consisting primarily of gas distribution pipelines, transmission pipelines, storage facilities, gathering lines and compressor stations, are recorded at historical cost.

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  For purposes of determining earnings per common share, the potentially dilutive securities the Company had outstanding were restricted stock units and performance shares.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the diluted weighted average shares outstanding shown on the Consolidated Statements of Income reflects the potential dilution as a result of these securities as determined using the Treasury Stock Method.
Restricted stock units and performance shares that are antidilutive are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share.
There were
1,987
securities and
8,732
securities excluded as being antidilutive for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation.
The Company granted
202,259
performance shares during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average fair value of such performance shares was $ 64.28
per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Performance shares are an award constituting units denominated in common stock of the Company, the number of which may be adjusted over a performance cycle based upon the extent to which performance goals have been satisfied.  Earned performance shares may be distributed in the form of shares of common stock of the Company, an equivalent value in cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock of the Company, as determined by the Company.
The performance shares do not entitle the participant to receive dividends during the vesting period.       The performance shares granted during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 include awards that must meet a performance goal related to either relative return on capital over a three-year performance cycle ("ROC performance shares"), methane intensity and greenhouse gas emissions reductions over a three-year performance cycle ("ESG performance shares") or relative shareholder return over a three-year performance cycle ("TSR performance shares").
The performance goal related to the ROC performance shares over the three-year performance cycle is the Company’s total return on capital relative to the total return on capital of other companies in a group selected by the Compensation Committee (“Report Group”).  Total return on capital for a given company means the average of the Report Group companies’ returns on capital for each twelve-month period corresponding to each of the Company’s fiscal years during the performance cycle, based on data reported for the Report Group companies in the Bloomberg database.  The number of these ROC performance shares that will vest and be paid will depend upon the Company’s performance relative to the Report Group and not upon the absolute level of return achieved by the Company.  The fair value of the ROC performance shares is calculated by multiplying the expected number of shares that will be issued by the average market price of Company common stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of forgone dividends over the vesting term of the award.  The fair value is recorded as compensation expense over the vesting term of the award. 14 Table of Contents     The performance goal related to the ESG performance shares over the three-year performance cycle consists of two parts: reductions in the rates of intensity of methane emissions for each of the Company's operating segments, and reduction of the consolidated Company's total greenhouse gas emissions.
The Company's Compensation Committee set specific target levels for methane intensity rates and total greenhouse gas emissions, and the performance goal is intended to incentivize and reward performance to the extent management achieves methane intensity and greenhouse gas reduction targets making progress towards the Company's 2030 goals.
The number of these ESG performance shares that will vest and be paid out will depend upon the number of methane intensity segment targets achieved and whether the Company meets the total greenhouse gas emissions target.
The fair value of these ESG performance shares is calculated by multiplying the expected number of shares that will be issued by the average market price of Company common stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of forgone dividends over the vesting term of the award.  The fair value is recorded as compensation expense over the vesting term of the award.     The performance goal related to the TSR performance shares over the three-year performance cycle is the Company’s three-year total shareholder return relative to the three-year total shareholder return of the other companies in the Report Group.  Three-year total shareholder return for a given company will be based on the data reported for that company (with the starting and ending stock prices over the performance cycle calculated as the average closing stock price for the prior calendar month and with dividends reinvested in that company’s securities at each ex-dividend date) in the Bloomberg database.  The number of these TSR performance shares that will vest and be paid will depend upon the Company’s performance relative to the Report Group and not upon the absolute level of return achieved by the Company.  The fair value price at the date of grant for the TSR performance shares is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, which includes a reduction in value for the present value of forgone dividends over the vesting term of the award.  This price is multiplied by the number of TSR performance shares awarded, the result of which is recorded as compensation expense over the vesting term of the award.
The Company granted
115,073
restricted stock units during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.  The weighted average fair value of such restricted stock units was $ 59.69
per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.  Restricted stock units represent the right to receive shares of common stock of the Company (or the equivalent value in cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock of the Company, as determined by the Company) at the end of a specified time period. These restricted stock units do not entitle the participant to receive dividends during the vesting period. The fair value at the date of grant of the restricted stock units (represented by the market value of Company common stock on the date of the award) must be reduced by the present value of forgone dividends over the vesting term of the award.
The fair value of restricted stock units on the date of award is recorded as compensation expense over the vesting period. Note 2 –
Asset Acquisitions and Divestitures
On June 30, 2022, the Company completed the sale of Seneca’s California assets, all of which are in the Exploration and Production segment, to Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC for a total sale price of $ 253.5  million, consisting of $ 240.9  million in cash and contingent consideration valued at $ 12.6  million at closing.
The Company pursued this sale given the strong commodity price environment and the Company's strategic focus in the Appalachian Basin.
Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company can receive up to three annual contingent payments between calendar year 2023 and calendar year 2025, not to exceed $ 10  million per year, with the amount of each annual payment calculated as $ 1.0
million for each $ 1
per barrel that the ICE Brent Average for each calendar year exceeds $ 95
per barrel up to $ 105
per barrel.
The sale price, which reflected an effective date of April 1, 2022, was reduced for production revenues less expenses that were retained by Seneca from the effective date to the closing date.
Under the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties, $ 220.7  million of the sale price at closing was accounted for as reduction of capitalized costs since the disposition did not alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to the cost center.
The remainder of the sale price ($ 32.8  million) was applied against assets that are not subject to the full cost method of accounting, with the Company recognizing a gain of $ 12.7  million on the sale of such assets.
The majority of this gain related to the sale of emission allowances.
The Company also eliminated the asset retirement obligation associated with Seneca’s California oil and gas assets.
This obligation amounted to $ 50.1  million and was accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs under the full cost method of accounting. 15 Table of Contents Note 3 –

Fair Value Measurements       The FASB authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements establishes a fair-value hierarchy and prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques that measure fair value. Those inputs are prioritized into three levels.
Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly at the measurement date. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability at the measurement date. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.        The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company's financial assets and liabilities (as applicable) that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.  Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   Recurring Fair Value Measures At fair value as of December 31, 2022 (Thousands of Dollars)    Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Netting

The net asset or net liability for each counterparty is recorded as an asset or liability on the Company’s balance sheet.   Derivative Financial Instruments       The derivative financial instruments reported in Level 2 at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 include natural gas price swap agreements, natural gas no cost collars, and foreign currency contracts, all of which are used in the Company’s Exploration and Production segment.
Hedging collateral deposits of $ 1.6  million (at December 31, 2022) and $ 91.7  million (at September 30, 2022), which were associated with the price swap agreements, no cost collars and foreign currency contracts, have been reported in Level 1.
The fair value of the Level 2 price swap agreements and no cost collars is based on an internal cash flow model that uses observable inputs (i.e. SOFR based discount rates for the price swap agreements and basis differential information, if applicable, at active natural gas and crude oil trading markets).
The fair value of the Level 2 foreign currency contracts is determined using the market approach based on observable market transactions of forward Canadian currency rates.      The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures require consideration of the impact of nonperformance risk (including credit risk) from a market participant perspective in the measurement of the fair value of assets and liabilities.  At December 31, 2022, the Company determined that nonperformance risk associated with the price swap agreements, no cost collars and foreign currency contracts would have no material impact on its financial position or results of operation.  To assess nonperformance risk, the Company considered information such as any applicable collateral posted, master netting arrangements, and applied a market-based method by using the counterparty's (assuming the derivative is in a gain position) or the Company’s (assuming the derivative is in a loss position) credit default swaps rates.       Derivative financial instruments reported in Level 2 at December 31, 2022 also includes the contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Exploration and Production segment's California assets on June 30, 2022, which is discussed at Note 2 – Asset Acquisitions and Divestitures and at Note 5 – Financial Instruments.
The fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses observable inputs, including the ICE Brent closing price as of the valuation date, initial and max trigger price, volatility, risk free rate, time of maturity and counterparty risk.       For the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were
no
assets or liabilities measured at fair value and classified as Level 3.

Financial Instruments   Long-Term Debt.
The fair market value of the Company’s debt, as presented in the table below, was determined using a discounted cash flow model, which incorporates the Company’s credit ratings and current market conditions in determining the yield, and subsequently, the fair market value of the debt.   Based on these criteria, the fair market value of long-term debt, including current portion, was as follows (in thousands):    December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022   Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Long-Term Debt $ 2,483,363   $ 2,320,923   $ 2,632,409   $ 2,453,209         The fair value amounts are not intended to reflect principal amounts that the Company will ultimately be required to pay. Carrying amounts for other financial instruments recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value. The fair value of long-term debt was calculated using observable inputs (U.S. Treasuries for the risk free component and company specific credit spread information – generally obtained from recent trade activity in the debt).  As such, the Company considers the debt to be Level 2.       Any temporary cash investments, notes payable to banks and commercial paper are stated at cost. Temporary cash investments are considered Level 1, while notes payable to banks and commercial paper are considered to be Level 2.  Given the short-term nature of the notes payable to banks and commercial paper, the Company believes cost is a reasonable approximation of fair value. Other Investments.
The components of the Company's Other Investments are as follows (in thousands):
At December 31, 2022 At September 30, 2022 Life Insurance Contracts $ 42,333   $ 42,171   Equity Mutual Fund 14,929   19,506   Fixed Income Mutual Fund 15,608   33,348   $ 72,870   $ 95,025         Investments in life insurance contracts are stated at their cash surrender values or net present value. Investments in an equity mutual fund and a fixed income mutual fund are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
The insurance contracts and equity mutual fund are primarily informal funding mechanisms for various benefit obligations the Company has to certain employees.
The fixed income mutual fund is primarily an informal funding mechanism for certain regulatory obligations that the Company has to Utility segment customers in its Pennsylvania jurisdiction, as discussed in Note 11 – Regulatory Matters, and for various benefit obligations the Company has to certain employees.
Derivative Financial Instruments.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage commodity price risk in the Exploration and Production segment.
The Company enters into over-the-counter no cost collars and over-the-counter swap agreements for natural gas to manage the price risk associated with forecasted sales of natural gas.
In addition, the Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the risk of currency fluctuations associated with transportation costs denominated in Canadian currency in the Exploration and Production segment. These instruments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The duration of the Company’s cash flow hedges does not typically exceed
5
years while the foreign currency forward contracts do not exceed
8
years.
On June 30, 2022, the Company completed the sale of Seneca’s California assets.
Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company can receive up to three annual contingent payments between calendar year 2023 and calendar year 2025, not to exceed $ 10  million per year, with the amount of each annual payment calculated as $ 1.0  million for each $ 1
per barrel that the ICE Brent Average for each calendar year exceeds $ 95
per barrel up to $ 105
per barrel.
The Company has determined that this contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative under the authoritative accounting guidance.
Changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration are marked-to-market each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in Other Income (Deductions) on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
The fair value of this contingent
19 Table of Contents consideration was estimated to be $ 8.4  million and $ 8.2  million at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
A $ 0.2  million mark-to-market adjustment was recorded during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.     The Company has presented its net derivative assets and liabilities as “Fair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments” on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.   Cash Flow Hedges       For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
389.0
Bcf of natural gas commodity derivative contracts (swaps and no cost collars) outstanding.     As of December 31, 2022, the Company was hedging a total of $ 54.7
million of forecasted transportation costs denominated in Canadian dollars with foreign currency forward contracts.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 327.8
million ($ 240.2
million after-tax) of net hedging losses included in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balance. It is expected that $ 180.6
million ($ 132.4
million after-tax) of such unrealized losses will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Income within the next 12 months as the underlying hedged transactions are recorded in earnings.

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. To mitigate such credit risk, management performs a credit check, and then on a quarterly basis monitors counterparty credit exposure. The majority of the Company’s counterparties are financial institutions and energy traders. The Company has over the-counter swap positions, no cost collars and applicable foreign currency forward contracts with
fifteen
counterparties of which
one
is in a net gain position. The Company had $ 3.8
million of credit exposure with the counterparty in a gain position at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022,
no
collateral was received from the counterparties by the Company. The Company's gain position on such derivative financial instruments had not exceeded the established thresholds at which the counterparties would be required to post collateral, nor had the counterparties' credit ratings declined to levels at which the counterparties were required to post collateral.     As of December 31, 2022,
thirteen
of the
fifteen
counterparties to the Company’s outstanding derivative financial contracts (specifically the over-the-counter swaps, over-the-counter no cost collars and applicable foreign currency forward contracts) had a common credit-risk related contingency feature. In the event the Company’s credit rating increases or falls below a certain threshold (applicable debt ratings), the available credit extended to the Company would either increase or
20 Table of Contents decrease. A decline in the Company’s credit rating, in and of itself, would not cause the Company to be required to post or increase the level of its hedging collateral deposits (in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit or treasury debt instruments).
If the Company’s outstanding derivative financial contracts with a credit-risk contingency feature were in a liability position (or if the liability were larger) and/or the Company’s credit rating declined, then hedging collateral deposits or an increase to such deposits could be required.  At December 31, 2022, the fair market value of the derivative financial instrument liabilities with a credit-risk related contingency feature was $ 224.9
million according to the Company’s internal model (discussed in Note 4 – Fair Value Measurements), and the Company posted $ 1.6
million in hedging collateral deposits.  Depending on the movement of commodity prices in the future, it is possible that these liability positions could swing into asset positions, at which point the Company would be exposed to credit risk on its derivative financial instruments.
In that case, the Company's counterparties could be required to post hedging collateral deposits.       The Company’s requirement to post hedging collateral deposits and the Company's right to receive hedging collateral deposits is based on the fair value determined by the Company’s counterparties, which may differ from the Company’s assessment of fair value.
Note 6 –
Income Taxes      The effective tax rate was
25.3 % for both of the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company was unable to utilize the Enhanced Oil Recovery tax credit, which it was able to utilize during the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
However, the effective tax rate remained the same for both periods as the Company continues to record a benefit of the reduction in the Pennsylvania state income tax rate that was enacted in July 2022.

Short-Term Borrowings.
On June 30, 2022, the Company entered into a new 364-Day Credit Agreement (the "364-Day Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of five banks, all of which are also lenders under the Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement provides an additional $ 250.0  million unsecured committed delayed draw term loan credit facility with a maturity date of June 29, 2023. The Company elected to draw $ 250.0  million under the facility on October 27, 2022.
The Company is using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included the redemption in November 2022 of $ 150.0  million of the Company's outstanding long-term debt maturing in March 2023.   Current Portion of Long-Term Debt.
The Current Portion of Long-Term Debt at December 31, 2022 consists of $ 350.0  million of
3.75 % notes and $ 49.0
million of
7.395 % notes that mature in March 2023. The Current Portion of Long-Term Debt at September 30, 2022 consisted of $ 500.0

7.395 % notes. The Company redeemed $ 150.0  million of the
3.75 % notes on November 25, 2022 using a portion of the proceeds from short-term borrowings, as discussed above.
Note 8 –
Commitments and Contingencies   Environmental Matters.
The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.  The Company has established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to comply with regulatory requirements.  It is the Company’s policy to accrue estimated environmental clean-up costs (investigation and remediation) when such amounts can reasonably be estimated and it is probable that the Company will be required to incur such costs.           At December 31, 2022, the Company has estimated its remaining clean-up costs related to former manufactured gas plant sites will be approximately $ 4.0
million.  The Company's liability for such clean-up costs has been recorded in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022.
The Company expects to recover its environmental clean-up costs through rate recovery over a period of approximately
one year
and is currently not aware of any material additional exposure to environmental liabilities.  However, changes in environmental laws and regulations, new information or other factors could have an adverse financial impact on the Company.      Northern Access Project.
On February 3, 2017, Supply Corporation and Empire received FERC approval of the Northern Access project described herein. Shortly thereafter, the NYDEC issued a Notice of Denial of the federal Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification and other state stream and wetland permits for the New York portion of the project (the Water Quality Certification for the Pennsylvania portion of the project was received in January of 2017). Subsequently, FERC issued an Order finding that the NYDEC exceeded the statutory time frame to take action under the Clean Water Act and, therefore, waived its opportunity to approve or deny the Water Quality Certification. FERC denied rehearing requests associated with its Order and FERC's decisions were appealed. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order upholding the FERC waiver orders. In addition, in the Company's state court litigation challenging the NYDEC's actions with regard to various state permits, the New York State Supreme Court issued a decision finding these permits to be preempted.
The Company remains committed to the project and, on June 29, 2022, received an extension of time from FERC, until December 31, 2024, to construct the project.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has spent approximately $ 55.9
million on the project, all of which is recorded on the balance sheet.   Other.
The Company is involved in other litigation and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business.  These other matters may include, for example, negligence claims and tax, regulatory or other governmental audits, inspections, investigations and other proceedings.  These matters may involve state and federal taxes, safety, compliance with regulations, rate base, cost of service and purchased gas cost issues, among other things.  While these other matters arising in the normal course of business could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the period in which they are resolved, an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss, if any, cannot be made at this time.   22 Table of Contents Note 9 –
Business Segment Information
The Company reports financial results for
four

Regulatory Matters New York   Jurisdiction          Distribution Corporation's current delivery rates in its New York jurisdiction were approved by the NYPSC in an order issued on April 20, 2017 with rates becoming effective May 1, 2017.
The order provided for a return on equity of
8.7 %, and directed the implementation of an earnings sharing mechanism to be in place beginning on April 1, 2018.
The order also authorized the Company to recover approximately $ 15  million annually for pension and other post-employment benefit ("OPEB") expenses from customers. Because the Company’s future pension and OPEB costs were projected to be satisfied with existing funds held in reserve, in July, Distribution Corporation made a filing with the NYPSC to effectuate a pension and OPEB surcredit to customers to offset these amounts being collected in base rates effective October 1, 2022. On September 16, 2022, the NYPSC issued an order approving the filing. The surcredit will remain in effect until modified by the NYPSC in another proceeding, or until December 31, 2024, whichever is earlier.
With the implementation of this surcredit, Distribution Corporation will no longer be funding the Retirement Plan or its VEBA trusts in its New York jurisdiction.     On August 13, 2021, the NYPSC issued an order extending the date through which qualified pipeline replacement costs incurred by the Company can be recovered using the existing system modernization tracker for two years (until March 31, 2023). The extension is contingent on the Company not filing a base rate case that would result in new rates becoming effective prior to April 1, 2023.
On December 9, 2022, the Company filed a petition with the NYPSC to effectuate a system improvement tracker through which qualified pipeline replacement costs would be tracked and recovered, and to recover certain deferred costs associated with the existing system modernization tracker, effective April 1, 2023.
That petition has been noticed for public comment and a determination is pending.     On January 19, 2023, the NYPSC issued an order in its Effects of COVID-19 on Utility Service (20-M-0266) and Energy Affordability for Low Income Utility Customers (14-M-0565) proceedings whereby a Phase 2 Utility Arrears Relief Program was authorized.
Specifically, the order directed Distribution Corporation and certain other New York utilities to, among other things, address arrears on residential non-energy affordability program ratepayer accounts that did not receive a credit under the NYPSC’s Phase 1 program and small commercial ratepayer accounts by issuing a one-time bill credit to such customers to reduce or eliminate accrued arrears through May 1, 2022.
The credits shall be processed within 90 days of the
24 Table of Contents effective date of the order, provided that residential non-EAP customers who had their service disconnected for non-payment in 2022 shall be allowed the opportunity to have their service reinstated in order to receive the credit through June 30, 2023.
The order further directs utilities to suspend residential service terminations for non-payment while arrears credits are applied to accounts through March 1, 2023, or 30 days after credits have been applied, whichever is later.
The order authorizes the utilities to recover the Phase 2 costs (the arrears credits and associated carrying charges) through a surcharge.
Utilities proposed various offsets to Phase 2 program costs, and Distribution Corporation has proposed certain offsets as part of an uncollectible expense reconciliation proposal.
Distribution Corporation will make a filing with the NYPSC seeking approval of its uncollectible expense reconciliation mechanism no later than 30 days from the January 19, 2023 effective date of the order.
Application of the proposed offsets and collection periods will be determined when the NYPSC rules on the uncollectible expense reconciliation filing. Pennsylvania Jurisdiction     Distribution Corporation’s current delivery rates in its Pennsylvania jurisdiction were approved by the PaPUC on November 30, 2006 as part of a settlement agreement that became effective January 1, 2007.
On October 28, 2022, Distribution Corporation made a filing with the PaPUC seeking an increase in its annual base rate operating revenues of $ 28.1  million with a proposed effective date of December 27, 2022. The Company is also proposing, among other things, to implement a weather normalization adjustment (WNA) mechanism and a new energy efficiency and conservation pilot program for residential customers. On December 8, 2022, the PaPUC issued an order suspending the filing until July 27, 2023 by operation of law unless directed otherwise by the PaPUC.
The matter has been assigned to an administrative law judge and remains pending.     Effective October 1, 2021, pursuant to a tariff supplement filed with the PaPUC, Distribution Corporation reduced base rates by $ 7.7  million in order to stop collecting OPEB expenses from customers. It also began to refund customers overcollected OPEB expenses in the amount of $ 50.0  million. Certain other matters in the tariff supplement were unresolved. These matters were resolved with the PaPUC’s approval of an Administrative Law Judge’s Recommended Decision on February 24, 2022. Concurrent with that decision, the Company discontinued regulatory accounting for OPEB expenses and recorded an $ 18.5  million adjustment during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 to reduce its regulatory liability for previously deferred OPEB income amounts through September 30, 2021 and to increase Other Income (Deductions) on the consolidated financial statements by a like amount. The Company also increased customer refunds of overcollected OPEB expenses from $ 50.0  million to $ 54.0  million.
All refunds specified in the tariff supplement are being funded entirely by grantor trust assets held by the Company, most of which are included in a fixed income mutual fund that is a component of Other Investments on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. With the elimination of OPEB expenses in base rates, Distribution Corporation is no longer funding the grantor trust or its VEBA trusts in its Pennsylvania jurisdiction.
FERC Jurisdiction     Supply Corporation’s 2020 rate settlement provides that no party may make a rate filing for new rates to be effective before February 1, 2024, except that Supply Corporation may file an NGA general Section 4 rate case to change rates if the corporate federal income tax rate is increased. If no case has been filed, Supply Corporation must file for rates to be effective February 1, 2025.
Empire’s 2019 rate settlement provides that Empire must make a rate case filing no later than May 1, 2025. 25 Table of Contents Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW       Please note that this overview is a high-level summary of items that are discussed in greater detail in subsequent sections of this report.     The Company is a diversified energy company engaged principally in the production, gathering, transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas.
The Company operates an integrated business, with assets centered in western New York and Pennsylvania, being utilized for, and benefiting from, the production and transportation of natural gas from the Appalachian basin.
Current development activities are focused primarily in the Marcellus and Utica shales. The common geographic footprint of the Company’s subsidiaries enables them to share management, labor, facilities and support services across various businesses and pursue coordinated projects designed to produce and transport natural gas from the Appalachian basin to markets in the eastern United States and Canada.
The Company's efforts in this regard are not limited to affiliated projects.
The Company has also been designing and building pipeline projects for the transportation of natural gas for non-affiliated natural gas customers in the Appalachian basin.
The Company reports financial results for four business segments.
For a discussion of the Company's earnings, refer to the Results of Operations section below.     On June 30, 2022, the Company completed the sale of Seneca’s California assets to Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC for a total sale price of $253.5 million, consisting of $240.9 million in cash and contingent consideration valued at $12.6 million at closing. The Company pursued this sale given the strong commodity price environment and the Company's strategic focus in the Appalachian Basin. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company can receive up to three annual contingent payments between calendar year 2023 and calendar year 2025, not to exceed $10 million per year, with the amount of each annual payment calculated as $1.0 million for each $1 per barrel that the ICE Brent Average for each calendar year exceeds $95 per barrel up to $105 per barrel.
The sale price, which reflected an effective date of April 1, 2022, was reduced for production revenues less expenses that were retained by Seneca from the effective date to the closing date.
Under the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties, $220.7 million of the sale price at closing was accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs since the disposition did not alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to the cost center.
The remainder of the sale price ($32.8 million) was applied against assets that are not subject to the full cost method of accounting, with the Company recognizing a gain of $12.7 million on the sale of such assets.
The majority of this gain related to the sale of emission allowances.
On June 30, 2022, the Company entered into a new 364-Day Credit Agreement (the "364-Day Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of five banks, all of which are also lenders under the Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement provides an additional $250.0 million unsecured committed delayed draw term loan credit facility with a maturity date of June 29, 2023. The Company elected to draw $250.0 million under the facility on October 27, 2022.
The Company is using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included the redemption in November 2022 of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt maturing in March 2023.
The Company does not anticipate long-term refinancing for the long-term debt maturing in March 2023.     From a financing perspective, the Company expects to use cash on hand, cash from operations, and short-term or long-term borrowings, as needed, to meet its financing needs for the remainder of fiscal 2023. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES       For a complete discussion of critical accounting estimates, refer to "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Item 7 of the Company's 2022 Form 10-K.  There have been no material changes to that disclosure other than as set forth below.  The information presented below updates and should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting estimates in that Form 10-K.   Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Costs.
The Company, in its Exploration and Production segment, follows the full cost method of accounting for determining the book value of its oil and natural gas properties, with natural gas properties in the Appalachian Region being the primary component after the June 30, 2022 sale of the Company's California oil and natural gas properties. That sale is discussed in more detail in Item 1 at Note 2 - Asset Acquisitions and Divestitures.  In accordance with the full cost methodology, the Company is required to perform a quarterly ceiling test.  Under the ceiling test, the present value of future revenues from the Company's oil and gas reserves based on an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil and gas prices for each month within the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period (the “ceiling”) is compared with the book value of the Company’s oil and gas properties at the balance sheet date.
The present value of future
26 Table of Contents revenues is calculated using a 10% discount factor.  If the book value of the oil and gas properties exceeds the ceiling, a non-cash impairment charge must be recorded to reduce the book value of the oil and gas properties to the calculated ceiling.
At December 31, 2022, the ceiling exceeded the book value of the oil and gas properties by approximately $3.3 billion. The 12-month average of the first day of the month price for natural gas for each month during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, based on the quoted Henry Hub spot price for natural gas, was $6.36 per MMBtu. (Note: Because actual pricing of the Company’s producing properties vary depending on their location and hedging, the prices used to calculate the ceiling may differ from the Henry Hub price, which is only indicative of 12-month average prices for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Actual realized pricing includes adjustments for regional market differentials, transportation fees and contractual arrangements.)  In regard to the sensitivity of the ceiling test calculation to commodity price changes, if natural gas prices were $0.25 per MMBtu lower than the average prices used at December 31, 2022 in the ceiling test calculation, the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the Company's oil and gas properties by approximately $3.0 billion (after-tax), which would not have resulted in an impairment charge. This calculated amount is based solely on price changes and does not take into account any other changes to the ceiling test calculation, including, among others, changes in reserve quantities and future cost estimates.
It is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future non-cash impairments under the SEC's full cost ceiling test.
Fluctuations in or subtractions from proved reserves, increases in development costs for undeveloped reserves and significant fluctuations in natural gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time.
For a more complete discussion of the full cost method of accounting, refer to "Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Costs" under "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Item 7 of the Company's 2022 Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Earnings       The Company's earnings were $169.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to earnings of $132.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.  The increase in earnings of $37.3 million is primarily the result of higher earnings in all reportable segments as well as in the Corporate category, slightly offset by a loss in the All Other category. Additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows.

Gas production revenue after hedging increased $67.4 million due to the impact of an 8.8 Bcf increase in natural gas production, together with a $0.50 per Mcf increase in the weighted average price of natural gas after hedging.
Natural gas production increased largely due to additional production from new Marcellus and Utica wells in the Appalachian region.
Oil production revenue after hedging decreased $34.6 million due to the sale of the Exploration and Production segment's California assets on June 30, 2022.
In addition, other revenue increased $0.6 million and gas processing plant revenue decreased $0.7 million.
The increase in other revenue was attributed to a temporary capacity release of the TransCanada Pipeline transportation contract.
The decrease in gas processing plant revenue was attributed to the sale of the California assets.     The Exploration and Production segment's earnings for the quarter
ended December 31, 2022 were $91.2 million, an increase of $28.8 million when compared with earnings of $62.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in earnings was due to higher natural gas production ($17.4 million), higher natural gas prices after hedging ($35.8 million), lower lease operating and transportation expenses ($6.0 million), lower other operating expenses ($3.3 million) and higher other income ($1.4 million).
The positive earnings impact of these items was partially offset by lower oil production ($27.4 million), higher depletion expense ($4.8 million), higher other taxes ($1.0 million), higher interest expense ($0.9 million) and a higher income tax expense ($1.2 million).
The decrease in lease operating and transportation expenses was primarily the result of the sale of the California assets, partially offset by higher gathering and transportation costs in the Appalachian region due to increased production.
The decrease in other operating expenses was primarily attributed to the California asset sale.
The increase in other income was attributed to interest income received on hedging collateral deposits, an unrealized gain on contingent consideration received as part of the California asset sale, as well as non-service pension and post-retirement income in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to non-service pension and post-retirement benefit costs in the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to the net increase in production combined with a $0.03 per Mcf increase in the depletion rate.
The increase in other taxes was attributed to higher Impact Fees in the Appalachian region offset partially by lower production and other taxes as a result of the California asset sale.
The increase in interest expense can largely be attributed to a higher average interest rate on intercompany short-term borrowings.
The increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by a prior year first quarter benefit realized from the Enhanced Oil Recovery tax credit, which did not recur in the current year as a result of the sale of the California assets. Pipeline and Storage   Pipeline and Storage Operating Revenues   Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Firm Transportation $ 75,456  $ 65,825  $ 9,631  Interruptible Transportation 745  444  301    76,201  66,269  9,932  Firm Storage Service 21,284  20,800  484  Interruptible Storage Service 2  —  2  Other 168  1,281  (1,113)                  $ 97,655  $ 88,350  $ 9,305    29 Table of Contents Pipeline and Storage Throughput   Three Months Ended December 31, (MMcf) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Firm Transportation 224,623  193,594  31,029  Interruptible Transportation 1,308  767  541    225,931  194,361  31,570    2022 Compared with 2021       Operating revenues for the Pipeline and Storage segment increased $9.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2021.  The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increases in transportation revenues of $9.9 million and storage revenues of $0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in other revenue of $1.1 million.
The increase in transportation revenues was primarily attributable to new demand charges for transportation service from Supply Corporation's FM100 Project, which was placed into service in December 2021.
The increase from the FM100 Project includes the impact of a negotiated revenue step-up to Period 2 Rates that went into effect April 1, 2022, as specified in Supply Corporation's 2020 rate case settlement.
An increase in short-term contracts also contributed to the increase in transportation revenues.
These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenues associated with miscellaneous contract terminations.
The increase in storage revenues was mainly due to the Period 2 Rates that went into effect April 1, 2022 related to the FM100 Project, as discussed above, as well as an increase in reservation charges for storage service from several new contracts that went into effect.
The decrease in other revenue primarily reflects lower electric surcharge true-up revenues.
Revenues collected through the electric surcharge mechanism are completely offset by an equal amount of electric power costs recorded in operation and maintenance expense.     Transportation volume for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 increased by 31.6 Bcf from the prior year's quarter
primarily due to an increase in volume from the FM100 Project, which was brought online in December 2021, as well as an increase in short-term contracts and an increase in volume from colder weather.
These were partially offset by certain contract terminations during the quarter.
Volume fluctuations, other than those caused by the addition or termination of contracts, generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of the straight fixed-variable rate design utilized by Supply Corporation and Empire.     The Pipeline and Storage segment’s earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were $29.5 million, an increase of $4.3 million when compared with earnings of $25.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the earnings impact of higher operating revenues of $7.4 million, as discussed above, combined with an increase in other income of $0.6 million.
The increase in other income is primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate on intercompany short-term notes receivables along with higher non-service pension and post-retirement benefit income.
This was partially offset by a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction (equity component) related to the construction of the FM100 Project that was placed into service in December 2021.
These earnings increases were partially offset by increases in operating expenses ($1.5 million), depreciation expense ($1.3 million), and interest expense ($0.6 million).
The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs, timing of dues and memberships and higher pipeline integrity costs.
This was partially offset by lower power costs related to Empire's electric motor drive compressor station.
The electric power costs are offset by an equal amount of revenue, as discussed above.
The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to incremental depreciation from Supply Corporation's FM100 Project going into service in December 2021.
The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction (debt component) related to the construction of the FM100 Project, discussed above, combined with higher interest rates on security deposits. 30 Table of Contents Gathering   Gathering Operating Revenues   Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Gathering Revenues $ 56,413  $ 52,225  $ 4,188  Gathering Volume   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Gathered Volume - (MMcf) 108,027  101,094  6,933    2022 Compared with 2021       Operating revenues for the Ga thering segment increased $4.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2021, which was driven primarily by a 6.9 Bcf increase in gathered volume.
The increase in gathered volume can be attributed primarily to an increase in natural gas production on the Covington and Clermont gathering systems, which recorded increases of 16.3 Bcf and 1.6 Bcf, respectively, partially offset by decreases on the Trout Run and Wellsboro gathering systems, which recorded decreases of 10.1 Bcf and 0.9 Bcf, respectively.
The net increase can be attributed to an increase in gross natural gas production in the Appalachian region by producers connected to the aforementioned gathering systems.     The Gathering segment’s earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were $24.7 million, an increase of $1.6 million when compared with earnings of $23.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in earnings was mainly due to higher gathering revenues ($3.3 million) driven by the increase in gathered volume, as discussed above.
This increase was partially offset by higher operating expenses ($1.2 million) and higher income tax expense ($0.6 million).
The increase in operating expenses was largely attributable to higher leased compression costs on the Trout Run and Covington gathering systems as well as higher compressor repairs and services on the Clermont and Covington gathering systems.     Utility Utility Operating Revenues   Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Retail Sales Revenues: Residential $ 245,442  $ 182,708  $ 62,734  Commercial 35,343  25,242  10,101  Industrial  1,643  1,157  486    282,428  209,107  73,321  Transportation       29,512  29,652  (140) Other (259) (2,000) 1,741                   $ 311,681  $ 236,759  $ 74,922  31 Table of Contents Utility Throughput Three Months Ended December 31, (MMcf) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Retail Sales: Residential 20,153  17,496  2,657  Commercial 2,994  2,543  451  Industrial 151  123  28    23,298  20,162  3,136  Transportation 18,310  17,593  717    41,608  37,755  3,853    Degree Days Three Months Ended December 31,       Percent Colder (Warmer) Than Normal 2022 2021 Normal (1) Prior Year (1) Buffalo, NY 2,253  2,048  1,704  (9.1) % 20.2  % Erie, PA 2,044  1,987  1,560  (2.8) % 27.4  %   (1) Percents compare actual 2022 degree days to normal degree days and actual 2022 degree days to actual 2021 degree days.   2022 Compared with 2021       Operating revenues for the Utility segment increased $74.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The increase resulted from a $73.3 million increase in retail gas sales revenue, which was primarily due to a significant increase in the cost of gas sold (per Mcf), as well as a 3.1 Bcf increase in throughput due to colder weather. Under its purchased gas adjustment clauses in New York and Pennsylvania, Distribution Corporation is not allowed to profit from fluctuations in gas costs. This increase in retail gas sales revenue was partially offset by a decrease in base rates related to a tariff filing approved by the NYPSC, which created a surcredit that temporarily eliminates pension and OPEB cost recovery from base rates effective October 1, 2022. Additional details related to the regulatory proceeding are discussed in the Rate Matters section and in Item 1 at Note 11 - Regulatory Matters. In addition, there was a $0.1 million decrease in transportation revenues and a $1.7 million increase in other revenues. The decrease in transportation revenues, in spite of a 0.7 Bcf increase in throughput, is mainly attributable to a decrease in base rates, as a result of the NYPSC tariff filing related to Pension and OPEB costs discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in the system modernization tracker allocation to transportation customers. The increase in other revenues is the result of a regulatory adjustment ($1.0 million), higher capacity release revenues ($0.7 million) and late payment charges billed to customers ($0.5 million). These increases were partially offset by a larger estimated refund provision from the income tax benefits resulting from the 2017 Tax Reform Act ($0.5 million).     The Utility segment’s earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were $23.8 million, an increase of $1.7 million when compared with earnings of $22.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The increase in earnings was mainly attributable to an increase in usage due to colder weather ($3.3 million), higher other operating revenues ($1.0 million), and the impact of a system modernization tracker in New York ($0.9 million). Higher other income of $0.5 million, consisting largely of interest on deferred gas costs, also contributed to the earnings increase.     These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the New York jurisdiction’s base rates resulting from the NYPSC tariff filing related to pension and OPEB costs discussed above, which temporarily eliminated the recovery of pension and OPEB expenses effective October 1, 2022 and reduced earnings for the quarter ($3.7 million). With the elimination of pension and OPEB expenses in customer rates, earnings benefited from a decrease in non-service pension and post-retirement benefit costs ($3.6 million), as Distribution Corporation’s New York service territory recognized pension and OPEB income during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period when it recognized pension and OPEB expenses to match against the pension and OPEB amounts collected in base rates. 32 Table of Contents     The Utility segment also experienced higher operating expenses ($2.4 million) and higher interest expense ($2.0 million) when comparing the quarter ended December 31, 2022 to the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs and an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts, due to higher gas costs. The increase in interest expense was largely the result of a higher weighted average interest rate on intercompany short-term borrowings.     The impact of weather variations on earnings in the Utility segment's New York rate jurisdiction is mitigated by that jurisdiction's weather normalization clause (WNC). The WNC in New York, which covers the eight-month period from October through May, has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the New York rate jurisdiction. In addition, in periods of colder than normal weather, the WNC benefits the Utility segment's New York customers. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the WNC increased earnings by approximately $0.9 million, as the weather was warmer than normal. For the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the WNC increased earnings by approximately $2.6 million, as the weather was warmer than normal. Corporate and All Other   2022 Compared with 2021       Corporate and All Other operations had earnings of $0.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $0.9 million when compared with a loss of $0.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded unrealized gains of $0.2 million. During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded unrealized losses of $3.5 million. These changes were offset by a decrease in realized gains from sales of investments in equity securities ($2.9 million). Other Income (Deductions)     Net other income on the Consolidated Statement of Income was $6.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to net other deductions of $1.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
This change is primarily attributable to non-service pension and post-retirement benefit income of $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as compared to non-service pension and post-retirement benefit expense of $4.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
As discussed above in the Utility segment, this is largely related to a tariff filing approved by the NYPSC during September 2022 in Distribution Corporation's New York service territory, which created a surcredit that temporarily eliminates pension and OPEB cost recovery from base rates effective October 1, 2022.
Accordingly, no pension and OPEB expenses were recorded during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 for that jurisdiction.
Other income (deductions) was also impacted by an increase in other interest income of $2.0 million.
This was driven by an increase in interest on temporary cash investments, increased interest on a larger undercollection of gas costs over the prior year in Distribution Corporation and an increase in interest received from hedging collateral deposits in the Exploration and Production segment.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction (equity component) of $1.0 million.
Interest Expense on Long-Term Debt       Interest expense on long-term debt on the Consolidated Statement of Income decreased $0.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the November 2022 redemption of $150.0 million of the $500.0 million 3.75% note due March 2023. 33 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY       The Company’s primary sources of cash during the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 consisted of cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from short-term borrowings and proceeds from the sale of a fixed income mutual fund held in a grantor trust. The Company’s primary sources of cash during the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 consisted of cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the sale of a fixed income mutual fund held in a grantor trust.     The Company expects to have adequate amounts of cash available to meet both its short-term and long-term cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. During the remainder of 2023, cash provided by operating activities is expected to increase over the amount of cash provided by operating activities when compared to the same period in 2022 and will be used to fund the Company's capital expenditures.
There are two long-term debt maturities in March 2023, of which $399 million are outstanding. The Company expects to repay those securities through the use of cash on hand at the date of maturity and short-term borrowings. Based on current commodity prices, cash provided by operating activities is expected to exceed capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 and 2024. This is expected to provide the Company with the option to consider additional growth investments, further reductions in short-term or long-term debt, and increasing the amount of cash flow returned to shareholders, either through increases to the Company’s dividend or via repurchases of common stock. These cash flow projections do not reflect the impact of acquisitions or divestitures that may arise in the future. Operating Cash Flow     Internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock, adjusted for non-cash expenses, non-cash income, gains and losses associated with investing and financing activities, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash items include depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation.     Cash provided by operating activities in the Utility and Pipeline and Storage segments may vary substantially from period to period because of the impact of rate cases. In the Utility segment, supplier refunds, over- or under-recovered purchased gas costs and weather may also significantly impact cash flow. The impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the Utility segment’s New York rate jurisdiction by its WNC and in the Pipeline and Storage segment by the straight fixed-variable rate design used by Supply Corporation and Empire.     Because of the seasonal nature of the heating business in the Utility segment, revenues in this business are relatively high during the heating season, primarily the first and second quarters of the fiscal year, and receivable balances historically increase during these periods from the receivable balances at September 30.     The storage gas inventory normally declines during the first and second quarters of the fiscal year and is replenished during the third and fourth quarters.  For storage gas inventory accounted for under the LIFO method, the current cost of replacing gas withdrawn from storage is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and a reserve for gas replacement is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption "Other Accruals and Current Liabilities." Such reserve is reduced as the inventory is replenished.     Cash provided by operating activities in the Exploration and Production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas as well as changes in production.  The Company uses various derivative financial instruments, including price swap agreements and no cost collars, in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk.     Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $327.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $155.8 million compared with $171.5 million provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects higher cash provided by operating activities in the Exploration and Production segment primarily due to higher cash receipts from natural gas production in the Appalachian region and higher realized natural gas prices.
34 Table of Contents Investing Cash Flow   Expenditures for Long-Lived Assets       The Company’s expenditures for long-lived assets totaled $223.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $191.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021.  The table below presents these expenditures: Total Expenditures for Long-Lived Assets           Three Months Ended December 31, 2022   2021   Increase (Decrease) (Millions)     Exploration and Production:           Capital Expenditures $ 168.5  (1) $ 139.2  (2) $ 29.3  Pipeline and Storage:           Capital Expenditures 16.4  (1) 24.1  (2) (7.7) Gathering:           Capital Expenditures 13.3  (1) 8.9  (2) 4.4  Utility:           Capital Expenditures 25.3  (1) 19.4  (2) 5.9  All Other: Capital Expenditures —  0.2  (0.2)   $ 223.5    $ 191.8    $ 31.7    (1) At December 31, 2022, capital expenditures for the Exploration and Production segment, the Pipeline and Storage segment, the Gathering segment and the Utility segment include $102.9 million, $2.1 million, $1.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of non-cash capital expenditures.

Exploration and Production         The Exploration and Production segment capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures in the Appalachian region (including $60.9 million in the Marcellus Shale area and $104.6 million in the Utica Shale area).  These amounts included approximately $110.5 million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves.
The Exploration and Production segment capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2021 were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures and included approximately $132.1 million for the Appalachian region (including $45.1 million in the Marcellus Shale area and $83.3 million in the Utica Shale area) and $7.1 million for the West Coast region.
These amounts included approximately $54.2 million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves.
Pipeline and Storage       The Pipeline and Storage segment capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily for additions, improvements and replacements to this segment's transmission and gas storage systems, which included system modernization expenditures that enhance the reliability and safety of the systems and reduce emissions. The Pipeline and Storage segment capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2021 were primarily for expenditures related to Supply Corporation's FM100 Project ($15.7 million).
In addition, the Pipeline and Storage segment capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2021 included additions, improvements and replacements to this segment’s transmission and gas storage systems. Gathering       The majority of the Gathering segment capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2022 included expenditures related to the continued expansion of Midstream Company's Clermont and Covington gathering systems, as
35 Table of Contents discussed below.
Midstream Company spent $5.7 million and $5.2 million, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 on the development of the Clermont and Covington gathering systems.
These expenditures were largely attributable to the installation of new in-field gathering pipelines in the Clermont gathering system. In the Tioga gathering system, which is part of Midstream Covington, expenditures were largely attributable to the expansion of on-pad and centralized station facilities related to bringing new development online.     The majority of the Gathering segment capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2021 included expenditures related to the continued expansion of Midstream Company's Clermont and Covington gathering systems.
Midstream Company spent $4.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2021 on the development of the Clermont and Covington gathering systems.
These expenditures were largely attributable to new Clermont gathering pipelines, as well as the development of new gathering facilities, including new gathering pipelines and upgrades to existing stations in the Tioga gathering system.     NFG Midstream Covington, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Midstream Company, operates its Covington gathering system as well as the Tioga gathering system, both in Tioga County, Pennsylvania. The current Covington gathering system consists of two compressor stations and backbone and in-field gathering pipelines. The Tioga gathering system consists of 16 compressor stations and backbone and in-field gathering pipelines.
NFG Midstream Clermont, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Midstream Company, continues to develop an extensive gathering system with compression in the Pennsylvania counties of McKean, Elk and Cameron.
The Clermont gathering system was initially placed in service in July 2014.
The current system consists of three compressor stations and backbone and in-field gathering pipelines.
The total cost estimate for the continued buildout will be dependent on the nature and timing of Seneca's long-term plans.
Utility         The majority of the Utility segment capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were made for main and service line improvements and replacements that enhance the reliability and safety of the system and reduce emissions.
Expenditures were also made for main extensions.
Other Investing Activities       In October 2021, the Company sold $30 million of fixed income mutual fund shares held in a grantor trust that was established for the benefit of Pennsylvania ratepayers.
The proceeds were used in the Utility segment’s Pennsylvania service territory to fund a one-time customer bill credit of $25 million in October 2021 for previously overcollected OPEB expenses and the first year installment of a 5-year pass back of an additional $29 million in previously overcollected OPEB expenses in accordance with new rates that went into effect on October 1, 2021.
In October 2022, the Company sold an additional $10 million of fixed income mutual fund shares held in the grantor trust. The proceeds from this sale were used to fund the second year installment of the 5-year pass back of overcollected OPEB expenses as well as to diversify a portion of grantor trust investments into lower risk money market mutual fund shares. Please refer to the Rate Matters section that follows for additional discussion of this matter.
On June 30, 2022, the Company completed the sale of Seneca’s California assets, all of which are in the Exploration and Production segment, to Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC for a total sale price of $253.5 million, consisting of $240.9 million in cash and contingent consideration valued at $12.6 million at closing. The Company pursued this sale given the strong commodity price environment and the Company’s strategic focus in the Appalachian Basin. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company can receive up to three annual contingent payments between calendar year 2023 and calendar year 2025, not to exceed $10 million per year, with the amount of each annual payment calculated as $1.0 million for each $1 per barrel that the ICE Brent Average for each calendar year exceeds $95 per barrel up to $105 per barrel. The sale price, which reflected an effective date of April 1, 2022, was reduced for production revenues less expenses that were retained by Seneca from the effective date to the closing date. Under the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties, $220.7 million of the sale price at closing was accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs since the disposition did not alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to the cost center. The remainder of the sale price ($32.8 million) was applied against assets that are not subject to the full cost method of accounting, with the Company recognizing a gain of $12.7 million on the sale of such assets. The majority of this gain related to the sale of emission allowances. 36 Table of Contents Project Funding       Over the past two years, the Company has been financing capital expenditures with cash from operations, short-term and long-term debt and proceeds from the sale of the Company's California assets.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, capital expenditures were funded with cash from operations and short-term debt. Going forward, the Company expects to use cash on hand, cash from operations and short-term borrowings to finance capital expenditures.
The level of short-term borrowings will depend upon the amount of cash provided by operations, which, in turn, will likely be most impacted by natural gas production, and the associated commodity price realizations, as well as the level of hedging collateral deposits in the Exploration and Production segment.
It will also likely depend on the timing of gas cost recovery in the Utility segment.
The Company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and potential investments in corporations, partnerships, and other business entities. The amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive natural gas properties, quicker development of existing natural gas properties, natural gas storage and transmission facilities, natural gas gathering and compression facilities and the expansion of natural gas transmission line capacities, regulated utility assets and other opportunities as they may arise. The amounts are also subject to modification for opportunities involving carbon emission reductions and/or energy transition including investments directly related to low- and no-carbon fuels.
While the majority of capital expenditures in the Utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines, the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the Company’s other business segments depends, to a large degree, upon market and regulatory conditions as well as legislative actions.   Financing Cash Flow       Consolidated short-term debt increased $190.0 million, to a total of $250.0 million, when comparing the balance sheet at December 31, 2022 to the balance sheet at September 30, 2022. The maximum amount of short-term debt outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $250.0 million.
In addition to cash provided by operating activities, the Company continues to consider short-term debt (consisting of short-term notes payable to banks and commercial paper) an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures, gas-in-storage inventory, unrecovered purchased gas costs, margin calls on derivative financial instruments, other working capital needs and repayment of long-term debt.
Fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short-term debt. For example, elevated commodity prices relative to its existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments could lead the Company to post margin with a number of its derivative counterparties. Given the recent decline in natural gas prices, the Company's margin requirements decreased to $1.6 million as of December 31, 2022.
The Company's margin deposits are reflected on the balance sheet as a current asset titled Hedging Collateral Deposits. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding short-term notes payable to banks of $250.0 million. The Company did not have any commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022.
On February 28, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of twelve banks. The Credit Agreement replaced the previous Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and a previous 364-Day Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides a $1.0 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 26, 2027.
On June 30, 2022, the Company entered into the 364-Day Credit Agreement with a syndicate of five banks, all of which are also lenders under the Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement provides an additional $250.0 million unsecured committed delayed draw term loan credit facility with a maturity date of June 29, 2023. The Company elected to draw $250.0 million under the facility on October 27, 2022. The Company is using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included using $150.0 million for the November 2022 redemption of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt maturing in March 2023.
The Company also has uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions for general corporate purposes.
Borrowings under these uncommitted lines of credit would be made at competitive market rates.
The uncommitted credit lines are revocable at the option of the financial institution and are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Company anticipates that its uncommitted lines of credit generally will be renewed or substantially replaced by similar lines.
Other financial institutions may also provide the Company with uncommitted or discretionary lines of credit in the future.     The total amount available to be issued under the Company’s commercial paper program is $500.0 million. The commercial paper program is backed by the Credit Agreement, which provides that the Company's debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed .65 at the last day of any fiscal quarter.
For purposes of calculating the debt to capitalization ratio, the Company's total capitalization will be increased by adding back 50% of the aggregate after-tax amount of non-cash charges
37 Table of Contents directly arising from any ceiling test impairment occurring on or after July 1, 2018, not to exceed $400 million. Since July 1, 2018, the Company recorded non-cash, after-tax ceiling test impairments totaling $381.4 million. As a result, at December 31, 2022, $190.7 million was added back to the Company's total capitalization for purposes of the calculation under the Credit Agreement and 364-Day Credit Agreement. On May 3, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement with the same twelve banks under the initial Credit Agreement. The amendment further modified the definition of consolidated capitalization, for purposes of calculating the debt to capitalization ratio under the Credit Agreement, to exclude, beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2022, all unrealized gains or losses on commodity-related derivative financial instruments and up to $10 million in unrealized gains or losses on other derivative financial instruments included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within Total Comprehensive Shareholders' Equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Under the Credit Agreement, such unrealized losses will not negatively affect the calculation of the debt to capitalization ratio, and such unrealized gains will not positively affect the calculation. The 364-Day Credit Agreement includes the same debt to capitalization covenant and the same exclusions of unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments as the Credit Agreement.
At December 31, 2022, the Company’s debt to capitalization ratio, as calculated under the Credit Agreement and 364-Day Credit Agreement, was .48.
The constraints specified in the Credit Agreement and 364-Day Credit Agreement would have permitted an additional $2.77 billion in short-term and/or long-term debt to be outstanding at December 31, 2022
(further limited by the indenture covenants discussed below) before the Company’s debt to capitalization ratio exceeded .65.     A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase borrowing costs, negatively impact the availability of capital from banks, commercial paper purchasers and other sources, and require the Company's subsidiaries to post letters of credit, cash or other assets as collateral with certain counterparties. If the Company is not able to maintain investment-grade credit ratings, it may not be able to access commercial paper markets.
However, the Company expects that it could borrow under its credit facilities or rely upon other liquidity sources.     The Credit Agreement and 364-Day Credit Agreement contain a cross-default provision whereby the failure by the Company or its significant subsidiaries to make payments under other borrowing arrangements, or the occurrence of certain events affecting those other borrowing arrangements, could trigger an obligation to repay any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and 364-Day Credit Agreement. In particular, a repayment obligation could be triggered if (i) the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries fails to make a payment when due of any principal or interest on any other indebtedness aggregating $40.0 million or more or (ii) an event occurs that causes, or would permit the holders of any other indebtedness aggregating $40.0 million or more to cause, such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity.
The Current Portion of Long-Term Debt at December 31, 2022 consists of $350.0 million of 3.75% notes and $49.0 million of 7.395% notes, that each mature in March 2023.
The Current Portion of Long-Term Debt at September 30, 2022 consisted of $500.0 million of 3.75% notes ($150.0 million of which was subsequently paid in November 2022) and $49.0 million of 7.395% notes, that each mature in March 2023. The Company does not anticipate long-term refinancing for these maturities.     The Company’s embedded cost of long-term debt was 4.52% at December 31, 2022 and 4.48% at December 31, 2021.     Under the Company’s existing indenture covenants at December 31, 2022, the Company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of approximately $2.85 billion in additional unsubordinated long-term indebtedness at then current market interest rates, in addition to being able to issue new indebtedness to replace existing debt. The Company's present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands. It is possible, depending on amounts reported in various income statement and balance sheet line items, that the indenture covenants could, for a period of time, prevent the Company from issuing incremental unsubordinated long-term debt, or significantly limit the amount of such debt that could be issued. Losses incurred as a result of significant impairments of oil and gas properties have in the past resulted in such temporary restrictions. The indenture covenants would not preclude the Company from issuing new long-term debt to replace existing long-term debt, or from issuing additional short-term debt. Please refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section above for a sensitivity analysis concerning commodity price changes and their impact on the ceiling test.
The Company’s 1974 indenture pursuant to which $99.0 million (or 4.0%) of the Company’s long-term debt (as of December 31, 2022) was issued, contains a cross-default provision whereby the failure by the Company to perform certain obligations under other borrowing arrangements could trigger an obligation to repay the debt outstanding under the indenture. In particular, a repayment obligation could be triggered if the Company fails (i) to pay any scheduled principal or interest on any debt under any other indenture or agreement or (ii) to perform any other term in any other such indenture or agreement, and the effect of the failure causes, or would permit the holders of the debt to cause, the debt under such indenture or agreement to become due prior to its stated maturity, unless cured or waived. 38 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS       In addition to the legal proceedings disclosed in Part II, Item 1 of this report, the Company is involved in other litigation and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business. These other matters may include, for example, negligence claims and tax, regulatory or other governmental audits, inspections, investigations or other proceedings. These matters may involve state and federal taxes, safety, compliance with regulations, rate base, cost of service and purchased gas cost issues, among other things. While these normal-course matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the period in which they are resolved, they are not expected to change materially the Company’s present liquidity position, nor are they expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.     Supply Corporation and Empire have developed a project which would move significant prospective Marcellus and Utica production from Seneca's Western Development Area at Clermont to an Empire interconnection with the TC Energy pipeline at Chippawa and an interconnection with TGP's 200 Line in East Aurora, New York (the “Northern Access project”). The Northern Access project would provide an outlet to Dawn-indexed markets in Canada and to the TGP line serving the U.S. Northeast. The Northern Access project involves the construction of approximately 99 miles of largely 24” pipeline and approximately 27,500 horsepower of compression on the two systems. Supply Corporation, Empire and Seneca executed anchor shipper agreements for 350,000 Dth per day of firm transportation delivery capacity to Chippawa and 140,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity to a new interconnection with TGP's 200 Line on this project.
The Company remains committed to the project and, on June 29, 2022, received an extension of time from FERC, until December 31, 2024, to construct the project.
The Company will update the $500 million preliminary cost estimate and expected in-service date for the project when there is further clarity on the timing of receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately $55.9 million has been spent on the Northern Access project, including $24.3 million that has been spent to study the project.
The remaining $31.6 million spent on the project is included in Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022.       The Company did not make any contributions to its tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (Retirement Plan) or its VEBA trusts for its other post-retirement benefits during the three months ended December 31, 2022, and does not anticipate making any such contributions during the remainder of fiscal 2023. Market Risk Sensitive Instruments       On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law.
The Dodd-Frank Act required the CFTC, SEC and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation, and includes provisions related to the swaps and over-the-counter derivatives markets that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse.
Although regulators have issued certain regulations, other rules that may impact the Company have yet to be finalized. Rules developed by the CFTC and other regulators could impact the Company. While many of those rules place specific conditions on the operations of swap dealers and major swap participants, concern remains that swap dealers and major swap participants will pass along their increased costs stemming from final rules through higher transaction costs and prices or other direct or indirect costs. Additionally, given the enforcement authority granted to the CFTC on anti-market manipulation, anti-fraud and disruptive trading practices, it is difficult to predict how the evolving enforcement priorities of the CFTC will impact our business.
Should the Company violate any laws or regulations applicable to our hedging activities, it could be subject to CFTC enforcement action and material penalties and sanctions. The Company continues to monitor these enforcement and other regulatory developments, but cannot predict the impact that evolving application of the Dodd-Frank Act may have on its operations.       The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures require consideration of the impact of nonperformance risk (including credit risk) from a market participant perspective in the measurement of the fair value of assets and liabilities.  At December 31, 2022, the Company determined that nonperformance risk associated with its natural gas price swap agreements, natural gas no cost collars and foreign currency contracts would have no material impact on its financial position or results of operation.  To assess nonperformance risk, the Company considered information such as any applicable collateral posted, master netting arrangements, and applied a market-based method by using the counterparty's (assuming the derivative is in a gain position) or the Company’s (assuming the derivative is in a loss position) credit default swaps rates.     For a complete discussion of all other market risk sensitive instruments used by the Company, refer to “Market Risk Sensitive Instruments” in Item 7 of the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K. 39 Table of Contents Rate Matters   Utility Operation       Delivery rates for both the New York and Pennsylvania divisions are regulated by the states’ respective public utility commissions and typically are changed only when approved through a procedure known as a “rate case.” As noted below, the Pennsylvania division currently has a rate case on file. In both jurisdictions, delivery rates do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs. Prudently-incurred gas costs are recovered through operation of automatic adjustment clauses, and are collected primarily through a separately-stated “supply charge” on the customer bill.
New York   Jurisdiction       Distribution Corporation's current delivery rates in its New York jurisdiction were approved by the NYPSC in an order issued on April 20, 2017 with rates becoming effective May 1, 2017.
The order provided for a return on equity of 8.7%, and directed the implementation of an earnings sharing mechanism to be in place beginning on April 1, 2018.
The order also authorized the Company to recover approximately $15 million annually for pension and OPEB expenses from customers. Because the Company's future pension and OPEB costs were projected to be satisfied with existing funds held in reserve, in July, Distribution Corporation made a filing with the NYPSC to effectuate a pension and OPEB surcredit to customers to offset these amounts being collected in base rates effective October 1, 2022. On September 16, 2022, the NYPSC issued an order approving the filing. The surcredit will remain in effect until modified by the NYPSC in another proceeding, or until December 31, 2024, whichever is earlier.
With the implementation of this surcredit, Distribution Corporation will no longer be funding the Retirement Plan or its VEBA trusts in its New York jurisdiction.     On August 13, 2021, the NYPSC issued an order extending the date through which qualified pipeline replacement costs incurred by the Company can be recovered using the existing system modernization tracker for two years (until March 31, 2023). The extension is contingent on the Company not filing a base rate case that would result in new rates becoming effective prior to April 1, 2023.
On December 9, 2022, the Company filed a petition with the NYPSC to effectuate a system improvement tracker through which qualified pipeline replacement costs would be tracked and recovered, and to recover certain deferred costs associated with the existing system modernization tracker, effective April 1, 2023.
That petition has been noticed for public comment and a determination is pending.     On January 19, 2023, the NYPSC issued an order in its Effects of COVID-19 on Utility Service (20-M-0266) and Energy Affordability for Low Income Utility Customers (14-M-0565) proceedings whereby a Phase 2 Utility Arrears Relief Program was authorized.
Specifically, the order directed Distribution Corporation and certain other New York utilities to, among other things, address arrears on residential non-energy affordability program ratepayer accounts that did not receive a credit under the NYPSC’s Phase 1 program and small commercial ratepayer accounts by issuing a one-time bill credit to such customers to reduce or eliminate accrued arrears through May 1, 2022.
The credits shall be processed within 90 days of the effective date of the order, provided that residential non-EAP customers who had their service disconnected for non-payment in 2022 shall be allowed the opportunity to have their service reinstated in order to receive the credit through June 30, 2023.
The order further directs utilities to suspend residential service terminations for non-payment while arrears credits are applied to accounts through March 1, 2023, or 30 days after credits have been applied, whichever is later.
The order authorizes the utilities to recover the Phase 2 costs (the arrears credits and associated carrying charges) through a surcharge.
Utilities proposed various offsets to Phase 2 program costs, and Distribution Corporation has proposed certain offsets as part of an uncollectible expense reconciliation proposal.
Distribution Corporation will make a filing with the NYPSC seeking approval of its uncollectible expense reconciliation mechanism no later than 30 days from the January 19, 2023 effective date of the order.
Application of the proposed offsets and collection periods will be determined when the NYPSC rules on the uncollectible expense reconciliation filing. Pennsylvania Jurisdiction       Distribution Corporation’s current delivery rates in its Pennsylvania jurisdiction were approved by the PaPUC on November 30, 2006 as part of a settlement agreement that became effective January 1, 2007. On October 28, 2022, Distribution Corporation made a filing with the PaPUC seeking an increase in its annual base rate operating revenues of $28.1 million with a proposed effective date of December 27, 2022. The Company is also proposing, among other things, to implement a weather normalization adjustment (WNA) mechanism and a new energy efficiency and conservation pilot program for residential customers.
On December 8, 2022, the PaPUC issued an order suspending the filing until July 27, 2023 by operation of law unless directed otherwise by the PaPUC.
The matter has been assigned to an administrative law judge and remains pending. 40 Table of Contents     Effective October 1, 2021, pursuant to a tariff supplement filed with the PaPUC, Distribution Corporation reduced base rates by $7.7 million in order to stop collecting OPEB expenses from customers. It also began to refund to customers overcollected OPEB expenses in the amount of $50.0 million. Certain other matters in the tariff supplement were unresolved. These matters were resolved with the PaPUC's approval of an Administrative Law Judge's Recommended Decision on February 24, 2022. Concurrent with that decision, the Company discontinued regulatory accounting for OPEB expenses and recorded an $18.5 million adjustment during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 to reduce its regulatory liability for previously deferred OPEB income amounts through September 30, 2021 and to increase Other Income (Deductions) on the consolidated financial statements by a like amount. The Company also increased customer refunds of overcollected OPEB expenses from $50.0 million to $54.0 million. All refunds specified in the tariff supplement are being funded entirely by grantor trust assets held by the Company, most of which are included in a fixed income mutual fund that is a component of Other Investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. With the elimination of OPEB expenses in base rates, Distribution Corporation is no longer funding the grantor trust or its VEBA trusts in its Pennsylvania jurisdiction.           Pipeline and Storage       Supply Corporation’s 2020 rate settlement provides that no party may make a rate filing for new rates to be effective before February 1, 2024, except that Supply Corporation may file an NGA general Section 4 rate case to change rates if the corporate federal income tax rate is increased. If no case has been filed, Supply Corporation must file for rates to be effective February 1, 2025.
Empire’s 2019 rate settlement provides that Empire must make a rate case filing no later than May 1, 2025. Environmental Matters       The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company has established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and comply with regulatory requirements. In 2021, the Company set methane intensity reduction targets at each of its businesses, an absolute greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for the consolidated Company, and greenhouse gas reduction targets associated with the Company’s utility delivery system. In 2022, the Company began measuring progress against these reduction targets. The Company's ability to estimate accurately the time, costs and resources necessary to meet emissions targets may change as environmental exposures and opportunities change and regulatory updates are issued.     For further discussion of the Company's environmental exposures, refer to Item 1 at Note 8 — Commitments and Contingencies under the heading “Environmental Matters.”     Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation in the United States. These efforts include legislation, legislative proposals and new regulations at the state and federal level, and private party litigation related to greenhouse gas emissions. Legislation or regulation that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could also include emissions limits, reporting requirements, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates to conserve energy or use renewable energy sources. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) legislation was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes a methane charge that is expected to be applicable to the reported annual methane emissions of certain oil and gas facilities, above specified methane intensity thresholds, starting in calendar year 2024. This portion of the IRA is to be administered by the EPA and potential fees will begin with emissions reported for calendar year 2024. The EPA regulates greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. The regulations implemented by the EPA impose more stringent leak detection and repair requirements, and further address reporting and control of methane and volatile organic compound emissions. The Company must continue to comply with all applicable regulations. Additionally, a number of states have adopted energy strategies or plans with aggressive goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Pennsylvania has a methane reduction framework with the stated goal of reducing methane emissions from well sites, compressor stations and pipelines. Pennsylvania's Governor also entered the Commonwealth into a cap-and-trade program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, however, the Commonwealth's participation is currently stayed due to ongoing litigation. Federal, state or local governments may provide tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources, mandate the use of specific fuels or technologies, or promote research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. The NYPSC, for example, initiated a proceeding to consider climate-related financial disclosures at the utility operating company level, and the New York State legislature passed the CLCPA that mandates reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2030, and by 85% from 1990 levels by 2050, with the remaining emission reduction achieved by controlled offsets. The CLCPA also requires electric generators to meet 70% of demand with renewable energy by
41 Table of Contents 2030 and 100% with zero emissions generation by 2040. These climate change and greenhouse gas initiatives could impact the Company's customer base and assets depending on the promulgation of final regulations and on regulatory treatment afforded in the process. Thus far, the only regulations promulgated in connection with the CLCPA are greenhouse gas emissions limits established by the NYDEC in 6 NYCRR Part 496, effective December 30, 2020. The NYDEC has until January 1, 2024 to issue further rules and regulations implementing the statute. The above-enumerated initiatives could also increase the Company’s cost of environmental compliance by increasing reporting requirements, requiring retrofitting of existing equipment, requiring installation of new equipment, and/or requiring the purchase of emission allowances. They could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals. Changing market conditions and new regulatory requirements, as well as unanticipated or inconsistent application of existing laws and regulations by administrative agencies, make it difficult to predict a long-term business impact across twenty or more years. Effects of Inflation     The Company’s operations are sensitive to increases in the rate of inflation because of its operational and capital spending requirements in both its regulated and non-regulated businesses.
For the regulated businesses, recovery of increasing costs from customers can be delayed by the regulatory process of a rate case filing.
For the non-regulated businesses, prices received for services performed or products produced are determined by market factors that are not necessarily correlated to the underlying costs required to provide the service or product.

Controls and Procedures   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. These rules refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.      Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting       There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Risk Factors     The risk factors in Item 1A of the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K have not materially changed other than as set forth below. The risk factor presented below superseded the risk factor having the same caption in the 2022 Form 10-K and should otherwise be read in conjunction with all of the risk factors disclosed in the 2022 Form 10-K.
STRATEGIC RISKS Climate change, and the regulatory, legislative, consumer behaviors and capital access developments related to climate change, may adversely affect operations and financial results.     Climate change, and the laws, regulations and other initiatives to address climate change, may impact the Company’s financial results.
In early 2021, the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement, the international effort to establish emissions reduction goals for signatory countries.
Under the Paris Agreement, signatory countries are expected to submit their nationally determined contributions to curb greenhouse gas emissions and meet the agreed temperature objectives every five years.
On April 22, 2021, the federal administration announced the U.S. nationally determined contribution to achieve a fifty to fifty-two percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution by 2030.
In addition to the federal reentry into the Paris Agreement, state and local governments, non-governmental organizations, investment firms, and financial institutions have made, and will likely continue to make, more aggressive efforts to reduce emissions and advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
Executive orders from the federal administration, in addition to federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed or adopted in an attempt to limit the effects of climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, could have significant impacts on the energy industry including government-imposed limitations, prohibitions or moratoriums on the use and/or production of gas, establishment of a carbon tax and/or methane fee, lack of support for system modernization, as well as accelerated depreciation of assets and/or stranded assets.
Federal and state legislatures have from time to time considered bills that would establish a cap-and-trade program, cap-and-invest program, methane fee or carbon tax to incent the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
For example, in August 2022, the federal Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, which includes a methane charge that is expected to be
44 Table of Contents applicable to the reported annual methane emissions of certain oil and gas facilities, above specified methane intensity thresholds, starting in calendar year 2024.
In addition, the New York State legislature, in early 2021, proposed a bill known as the Climate and Community Investment Act, which proposed an escalating fee starting at $55 per short ton of carbon dioxide equivalent on any carbon-based fuels sold, used or brought into the state.
That bill did not pass, but similar legislation may be proposed in the future.
In December 2022, New York’s Climate Action Council issued a final scoping plan recommending the implementation of a cap-and-invest program in New York.
In January 2023, New York’s Governor announced a cap-and-invest program as part of her 2023 State of the State address.
The Governor directed the Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to advance an economywide cap-and-invest program that establishes a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions, and invests in programs to drive emissions reductions.
If this proposed program becomes effective and the Company becomes subject to new or revised cap-and-trade programs, cap-and-invest programs, methane charges, fees for carbon-based fuels or other similar costs or charges, the Company may experience additional costs and incremental operating expenses, which would impact our future earnings and cash flows.     A number of states have also adopted energy strategies or plans with goals that include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
For example, Pennsylvania has a methane reduction framework for the natural gas industry which has resulted in permitting changes with the stated goal of reducing methane emissions from well sites, compressor stations and pipelines.
In addition, the NYPSC initiated a proceeding to consider climate-related financial disclosures at the utility operating level, and in 2019, the New York State legislature passed the CLCPA, which created emission reduction and electric generation mandates, and could ultimately impact the Utility segment’s customer base and business.
Pursuant to the CLCPA, New York's Climate Action Council approved a final scoping plan that includes recommendations to
strategically downsize and decarbonize the natural gas system and curtail use of natural gas and natural gas appliances. The final scoping plan was approved and adopted on December 19, 2022 and includes detailed recommendations to meet the CLCPA’s emissions reduction targets
in the transportation, buildings, electricity, industry, agriculture & forestry and waste sectors.
The final scoping plan also recommends statewide and cross-sector policies relevant to gas system transition, economywide strategies, land use, local government and adaptation and resilience.     Legislation or regulation that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could also include natural gas bans, greenhouse gas emissions limits and reporting requirements, carbon taxes and/or similar fees on carbon dioxide, methane or equivalent emissions, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards requiring system remediation and/or changes in operating practices, and incentives or mandates to conserve energy or use renewable energy sources.
NYDEC finalized its Part 203 Oil and Gas Sector Rule in March 2022, which significantly increases leak detection and repair inspections, recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements for multiple sources along city gates, transmission pipelines, compressor stations, storage facilities, and gathering lines.
Additionally, the trend toward increased energy conservation, change in consumer behaviors, competition from renewable energy sources, and technological advances to address climate change may reduce the demand for natural gas.
For further discussion of the risks associated with environmental regulation to address climate change, refer to Item 2, MD&A under the heading “Environmental Matters.”
Further, recent trends directed toward a low-carbon economy could shift funding away from, or limit or restrict certain sources of funding for, companies focused on fossil fuel-related development or carbon-intensive investments.
To the extent financial markets view climate change and greenhouse gas emissions as a financial risk, the Company’s cost of and access to capital could be negatively impacted.      Item 2.
