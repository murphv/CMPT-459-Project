NOTE 1 – Description of Business and
Basis of Presentation
NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
(the “Company” or “NeuroOne”), a Delaware corporation, is an early-stage medical technology company developing
comprehensive neuromodulation electroencephalogram (cEEG) and stereoelectrocencephalography (sEEG) recording, monitoring, ablation, and
brain stimulation solutions to diagnose and treat patients with epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, essential tremors, chronic
pain due to failed back surgeries and other related neurological disorders.
The Company received 510(k) clearance from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for its Evo cortical technology in November 2019 and in October 2022, the Company
received 510(k) from the FDA clearance for its Evo sEEG electrode technology for temporary (less than 30 days) use
with
recording, monitoring, and stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface
level of the brain.
To date, the Company has had limited commercial sales.
The Company is based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota.
Global Economic Conditions
Generally, worldwide economic conditions remain
uncertain, particularly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased inflation. The general economic and capital market conditions
both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in the past and at times have adversely affected the Company’s access to capital
and increased the cost of capital. The capital and credit markets may not be available to support future capital raising activity on favorable
terms or at all. If economic conditions continue to decline, the Company’s future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the
capital markets could be adversely affected.
The COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2019
introduced significant volatility to the global economy, disrupted supply chains and had a widespread adverse effect on the financial
markets. Additionally, the Company’s operating results could be materially impacted by changes in the overall macroeconomic environment
and other economic factors. Changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, labor shortages, the conflict
in Ukraine, and steps taken by governments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other stimulus
and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which has led to an increase in costs and has caused changes in fiscal and monetary
policy, including increased interest rates.
Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed financial statements
may not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP; however, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and the notes thereto for the year ended September 30, 2022 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The condensed balance sheet at
September 30, 2022 was derived from the audited financial statements of the Company.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
consisting of only normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows for the interim periods, have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.

NOTE 2 – Going Concern
The accompanying
condensed financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred
losses since inception, negative cash flows from operations, and an accumulated deficit of $ 52.6
million as of December 31, 2022. To date,
the Company’s revenues have not been sufficient to cover its full operating costs, and as such, has been dependent on funding operations
through the issuance of debt and sale of equity securities. The Company does not have adequate liquidity to fund its operations without
raising additional funds and such actions are not solely within the control of the Company. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this condition. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds, or the Company’s anticipated operating results
are not achieved, management believes planned expenditures may need to be reduced in order to extend the time period that existing resources
can fund the Company’s operations. The Company intends to fund ongoing activities by utilizing its current cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments on hand, from product and collaborations revenue and by raising additional capital through equity or debt financings.
If management is unable to obtain the necessary capital, it may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the Company and the
development of its technology, or the Company may have to cease operations altogether.
NOTE 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Management’s Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original contractual maturity on date of purchase of less than or equal to three months to be classified and presented as cash
equivalents on the Balance Sheets. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company’s cash and cash
equivalents may include demand deposit accounts with large financial institutions, institutional money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
and corporate notes and bonds. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of the financial institutions, institutional money market funds,
and corporations in which the Company invests its surplus funds. The Company has experienced no credit losses from its cash and cash equivalent
investments.
Short Term Investment
The Company invests its excess cash in United
States (“U.S.”) Treasury securities and highly rated corporate securities. The Company intends and has the ability to hold
these investments to maturity. Securities with original maturity dates of more than three months are reported as held-to-maturity investments
and are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the negligible risk of changes in value due to interest rates.
All investments held as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 had contractual maturities of less than one year. The amortized cost
and estimated fair values of the Company’s investments as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 are as follows:

Revenue Recognition
The Company
entered into a development and distribution agreement which has current and future revenue recognition implications. See “Note 7
– Zimmer Development Agreement.”
In determining
the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under its agreements, the Company performs the following
steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services
are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction
price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based
on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
Product
Revenue
Revenues
from product sales are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an
amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. At the inception
of each customer contract, performance obligations are identified and the total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations.
The Company commenced commercial sales of cEEG strip/grid and electrode cable assembly products in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
Cost
of Product Revenue
Cost of
product revenue consists of the manufacturing and materials costs incurred by the Company’s third-party contract manufacturer in
connection with the Company’s strip and grid cortical electrodes (the “Strip/Grid Products”) and outside supplier materials
costs in connection with the
electrode cable assembly products (“Electrode Cable Assembly Products”) .
In addition, cost of product revenue includes royalty fees incurred in connection with the Company’s license agreements.
Collaborations
Revenue
A performance
obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in Account Standards
Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606. (“ASC 606”). Performance obligations may include license rights, development services,
and services associated with regulatory submission and approval processes. Significant management judgment is required to determine the
level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company expects to complete its performance obligations under
the arrangement. If the Company cannot reasonably estimate when its performance obligations are either completed or become inconsequential,
then revenue recognition is deferred until the Company can reasonably make such estimates. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining
estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method.
As part
of the accounting for collaboration arrangements, the Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone
selling price of each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company uses key assumptions to determine the stand-alone
selling price, which may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and
probabilities of technical and regulatory success. The Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation based
on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or service underlying each performance obligation.
7
NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
Notes to Condensed Financial Statements
(unaudited)
Licenses
of intellectual property : If the license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other
performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to
the license when the license is transferred to the customer, and the customer can use and benefit from the license. For licenses that
are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine
whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of
measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. The Company evaluates the measure of progress
each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
Milestone
payments : At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether the milestones are
considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method.
If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the value of the associated milestone (such as a regulatory submission)
is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company, such as approvals from regulators,
are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. When the Company’s assessment of probability of
achievement changes and variable consideration becomes probable, any additional estimated consideration is allocated to each performance
obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or service underlying each performance obligation
and recorded in collaborations revenues based upon when the customer obtains control of each element.
Royalties :
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed
to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (a) when the related sales occur,
or (b) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s accounting for fair value
measurements of assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring or nonrecurring
basis adheres to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
●
Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the Company at the measurement date.
●
Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
●
Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022,
the fair values of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid and other assets, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximated their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these assets or liabilities.
There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy
levels during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Intellectual
Property
The Company
has entered into two licensing agreements with major research institutions, which allow for access to certain patented technology
and know-how. Payments under those agreements are capitalized and amortized to general and administrative expense over the expected useful
life of the acquired technology.
8
NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
Notes to Condensed Financial Statements
(unaudited)
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment is recorded at cost and reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the estimated useful
lives of the assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful life for equipment and furniture ranges from three to seven
years and three years for software. Tangible assets acquired for research and development activities and that have alternative
use are capitalized over the useful life of the acquired asset. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed, and, when appropriate,
changes are made prospectively. Software purchased for internal use consists primarily of amounts paid for perpetual licenses to third-party
software providers and installation costs. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and
an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Maintenance and repairs are charged directly
to expense as incurred.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
The Company
evaluates its long-lived assets, which consist of licensed intellectual property, property and equipment and right of use assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company assesses
the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether or not the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted
expected future cash flows. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between
the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.
Allowances
for Doubtful Accounts
The Company
records a provision for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectability
of its accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers, among other factors, the aging of
the accounts receivable, its historical write-offs, the credit worthiness of each customer, and general economic conditions. Account balances
are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes that it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. Actual
write-offs may be in excess of the Company’s estimated allowance.
Inventories
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out “FIFO” method) or net realizable value. The Company calculates
inventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory, when appropriate, based on current inventory levels, movement, expected
useful lives, and estimated future demand of the products and spare parts. The Company’s inventory is currently comprised of cEEG
strip/grid and electrode cable assembly work-in-process and finished good product. The Strip/Grid Products are produced by a third-party
contract manufacturer and the Electrode Cable Assembly Products are obtained from outside suppliers.
Research
and Development Costs
Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development expenses may include costs incurred in performing research
and development activities, including clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs for both clinical and pre-clinical materials as well as
other contracted services, license fees, and other external costs. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be
used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity is performed or when the goods have been received, rather
than when payment is made, in accordance with ASC 730,  Research and Development .
Selling,
General and Administrative
Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation for personnel in functions
not directly associated with research and development activities. Other significant costs include legal and litigation costs relating
to corporate matters, intellectual property costs, professional fees for consultants assisting with regulatory, clinical, product development,
financial matters, and sales and marketing in connection with the commercial sales of the Company’s products.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718,
Compensation — Stock Compensation
(“ASC 718”). Accordingly, compensation
costs related to equity instruments granted are recognized at the grant-date fair value. The Company records forfeitures when they occur.
Stock-based compensation arrangements to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 718.
Income
Taxes
For the
Company, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax base and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized.
Net Loss Per Share
For the Company, basic loss per share of common
stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings or loss per share of common stock
is computed similarly to basic earnings or loss per share except the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to include additional
shares from the assumed exercise of any common stock equivalents, if dilutive. The Company’s warrants, stock options and restricted
stock units are considered common stock equivalents for this purpose. Diluted earnings is computed utilizing the treasury method for the
warrants, stock options and restricted stock units. No incremental common stock equivalents were included in calculating diluted loss
per share because such inclusion would be anti-dilutive given the net loss reported for both the three months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021.
The following potential common shares were not
considered in the computation of diluted net loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the three months ended December

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “ Financial Instruments – Credit Losses” . The ASU sets forth a “current
expected credit loss” (“CECL”) model which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial
instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. This
replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized
cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019,
including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Recently, the FASB issued the final ASU to delay adoption
for smaller reporting companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this
ASU will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06 , Debt—Debt
with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which, among other things, provides
guidance on how to account for contracts on an entity’s own equity. This ASU eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion
accounting models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity’s own equity that
are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, this ASU modifies how particular convertible
instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. The amendments in this ASU
are effective for smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The
Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective October 1, 2022 and the ASU did not have a material impact to our financial statements.

NOTE 4 – Commitments and Contingencies
WARF
License Agreement
The Company has entered into an exclusive start-up
company license agreement with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”) for WARF’s neural probe array and thin
film micro electrode technology (the “WARF License”).
The WARF License grants to the Company an exclusive
license to make, use and sell, in the United States only, products that employ certain licensed patents for a neural probe array
or thin-film micro electrode array and method. The Company agreed to pay WARF a royalty equal to a single-digit percentage of our product
sales pursuant to the WARF License, with a minimum annual royalty payment of $ 50,000  for 2020, $ 100,000  for 2021 and $ 150,000  for
2022 and each calendar year thereafter that the WARF License is in effect. If the Company or any of its sublicensees contest the validity
of any licensed patent, the royalty rate will be doubled during the pendency of such contest and, if the contested patent is found to
be valid and would be infringed by the Company if not for the WARF License, the royalty rate will be tripled for the remaining term of
the WARF License.
WARF may terminate the WARF License on 30 days’
written notice if we default on the payments of amounts due to WARF or fail to timely submit development reports, actively pursue our
development plan or breach any other covenant in the WARF License and fail to remedy such default in 90 days or in the event of certain
bankruptcy events involving us. The WARF License otherwise expires by its terms on the date that no valid claims on the patents licensed
thereunder remain. The Company expects the latest expiration of a licensed patent to occur in 2030. During the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, $ 37,500
and $ 25,000
in royalty fees were incurred related to the WARF License, respectively
and
were reflected as a component of cost of product revenue.
Mayo
Agreement
The Company
has an exclusive license and development agreement with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”) related
to certain intellectual property and development services for thin film micro electrode technology (“Mayo Agreement”). If
the Company is successful in obtaining regulatory approval, the Company is to pay royalties to Mayo based on a percentage of net sales
of products of the licensed technology through the term of the Mayo Agreement, set to expire May 25, 2037.
During the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 690
and $ 739
in royalty fees were incurred related to the Mayo Agreement, respectively, and
were reflected as a component of cost of product revenue.
Facility Leases
Headquarters Lease
On October 7, 2019, the Company entered into a
non-cancellable lease agreement (the “Lease”) with certain landlords (together, the “Landlord”) pursuant to which
the Company has agreed to lease office space located at 7599 Anagram Drive, Eden Prairie, Minnesota (the “Premises”). The
Company took possession of the Premises on November 1, 2019, with the term of the Lease ending 65 months after such date, unless terminated
earlier (the “Term”).
The initial base rent for the Premises is $6,410 per month for the first 17 months, increasing to $7,076
per month by the end of the Term. In addition, as long as the Company is not in default under the Lease, the Company shall be entitled
to an abatement of its base rent for the first 5 months. In addition, the Company will pay its pro rata share of the Landlord’s
annual operating expenses associated with the premises, calculated as set forth in the Lease of which the Company is entitled to an abatement
of these operating expense for the first 3 months.
Los Gatos Lease
On July 1, 2021, the Company entered into a non-cancellable
facility lease (the “Los Gatos Lease”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to rent office space for its research and development
operations located at 718 University Avenue, Suite #111, Los Gatos, California. The facility space under the Los Gatos Lease is approximately
1,162
square feet. The Company took possession of the office space on July 2, 2021. The initial monthly rent under the Los Gatos Lease
was approximately $ 4,241 . On November 4, 2022, the Los Gatos Lease was extended for an additional
two years
to
December 31, 2024. The rent under the extended Los Gatos Lease ranges from $ 4,453
to $ 4,632

In the ordinary course of business, from time
to time, the Company may be subject to a broad range of claims and legal proceedings that relate to contractual allegations, patent infringement
and other claims. The Company establishes accruals when applicable for matters and commitments which it believes losses are probable and
can be reasonably estimated. To date, no loss contingency for such matters and potential commitments have been recorded. Although it is
not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters or potential commitments, the Company is of the opinion that the ultimate
resolution of these matters and potential commitments will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial
position.

NOTE 7 – Zimmer Development Agreement
On July
20, 2020, the Company entered into an exclusive development and distribution agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Zimmer
Development Agreement”) with Zimmer, Inc. (“Zimmer”), pursuant to which the Company granted Zimmer exclusive global
rights to distribute the Strip/Grid Products and electrode cable assembly products (the “Electrode Cable Assembly Products”).
Additionally, the Company granted Zimmer the exclusive right and license to distribute certain depth electrodes developed by the Company
(“sEEG Products”, and together with the Strip/Grid Products and Electrode Cable Assembly Products, the “Products”).
The parties have agreed to collaborate with respect to development activities under the Zimmer Development Agreement through a joint development
committee composed of an equal number of representatives of Zimmer and the Company.
Under the
terms of the Zimmer Development Agreement, the Company is responsible for all costs and expenses related to developing the Products, and
Zimmer is responsible for all costs and expenses related to the commercialization of the Products. In addition to the Zimmer Development
Agreement, Zimmer and the Company have entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “MS Agreement”) and a supplier
quality agreement (the “Quality Agreement”) with respect to the manufacturing and supply of the Products.
Except as
otherwise provided in the Zimmer Development Agreement, the Company is responsible for performing all development activities, including
non-clinical and clinical studies directed at obtaining regulatory approval of each Product. Zimmer has agreed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to promote, market and sell each Product following the “Product Availability Date” (as defined in the Zimmer Development
Agreement) for such Product.
Pursuant
to the Zimmer Development Agreement, Zimmer made an upfront initial exclusivity fee payment of $ 2.0  million (the “Initial Exclusivity
Fee”) to the Company in fiscal year 2020.
On August
2, 2022, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the Zimmer Development Agreement with Zimmer. Pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Third Amendment, Zimmer made a $ 3.5
million payment to the Company.
In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in the Zimmer Development Agreement, the fee and milestone payment provisions in the Zimmer Development Agreement were replaced
with the following below:
●
$ 1.5
million for the sEEG Exclusivity Maintenance Fee; and
●
$ 2.0
million for satisfaction of each of the milestone events related to the design of sEEG products set forth in the Development Agreement even though the satisfaction was after the deadlines originally identified.
In addition,
in connection with the Third Amendment, the Company issued Zimmer a warrant to purchase common stock (the “2022 Zimmer Warrant”).
The 2022 Zimmer Warrant is exercisable for up to an aggregate of  350,000  shares of the Company’s common stock. The 2022
Zimmer Warrant has an exercise price of $ 3.00  per share, will be exercisable commencing six months from the issuance date, and will
expire on August 2, 2027. The fair value of the 2022 Zimmer Warrant of $ 0.1
million was based on the Black-Scholes pricing model. Input
assumptions used were as follows: a risk-free interest rate of
2.9 %; expected volatility of
53.5 %; expected life of
5
years; expected
dividend yield of
0 %; and the underlying fair market of the common stock. The 2022 Zimmer Warrant was classified in stockholders’
equity as the number of shares were fixed and determinable, no cash settlement was required and no other provisions precluded equity treatment.

The Zimmer Development Agreement will expire on
the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the last Products to achieve a first commercial sale, unless terminated
earlier pursuant to its terms. Either party may terminate the Zimmer Development Agreement (x) with written notice for the other party’s
material breach following a cure period or (y) if the other party becomes subject to certain insolvency proceedings. In addition, Zimmer
may terminate the Zimmer Development Agreement for any reason with 90 days’ written notice, and the Company may terminate the Zimmer
Development Agreement if Zimmer acquires or directly or indirectly owns a controlling interest in certain competitors of the Company.
The license rights granted to Zimmer under the Strip/Grid Distribution License and sEEG Distribution License shall be exclusive from the
effective date of the Third Amendment until the end of the term.
The Zimmer Development Agreement and Third Amendment
were accounted for under the provisions of ASC 606. In accordance with the provisions under ASC 606, the Company identified five performance
obligations under the Zimmer Development Agreement and Third Amendment: (1) the Company’s obligation to grant Zimmer access to its
intellectual property; (2) completion of sEEG Product development; (3) completion of Strip/Grid Product development; (4) the provision
of sEEG exclusivity maintenance; and (5) completion of sEEG design modifications as requested by Zimmer. All performance obligations under
the Zimmer Development Agreement and Third Amendment were met as of December 31, 2022.
The aggregate transaction price associated with
the Zimmer Development Agreement and Third Amendment was $ 5.4
million comprising the Initial Exclusivity Fee of $ 2.0
million and the $ 3.5
million payment under the Third Amendment, less the fair value of the 2022 Zimmer Warrant of $ 0.1
million. The transaction price was allocated
between performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The Company used a market based valuation approach
and an expected cost plus margin approach with regard to estimating the standalone selling price for the performance obligations.
In October 2022, the Company received 510(k) clearance
from the FDA for its Evo sEEG electrode technology for temporary (less than 30 days) use with recording, monitoring, and stimulation equipment
for the recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface level of the brain. Accordingly, the Company recognized
revenue in the amount of $ 1,455,188
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 related to the completion of the sEEG exclusivity
maintenance milestone. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenue in the amount of $ 6,374
related
to sEEG Product development.
A reconciliation of the closing balance of deferred
revenue related to the Zimmer Development Agreement and Third Amendment is as follows during the three months ended as of December 31,
2022 and 2021:

NOTE 10 – Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
zero
percent. As a result of the analysis of all available evidence as of December 31, 2022 and September
30, 2022, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. Consequently, the Company reported no income
tax benefit during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. If the Company’s assumptions change and the Company
believes that it will be able to realize these deferred tax assets, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance
on deferred tax assets will be recognized as a reduction of future income tax expense.  If the assumptions do not change, each
period the Company could record an additional valuation allowance on any increases in the deferred tax assets.
NOTE 11 – Stockholders’ Equity
At-The-Market Offering
On December 21, 2022, the Company entered into
a Capital on Demand TM
Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC (“JonesTrading”) to create an
at-the-market offering program (“ATM”) under which the Company may offer and sell shares having an aggregate offering price
of up to $ 14.5
million. JonesTrading is entitled to a commission at a fixed commission rate equal to up to
3 % of the gross proceeds. As
of December 31, 2022, no issuances of securities have occurred in connection with the ATM, and deferred issuance costs in the amount of
$ 103,787
have been incurred in connection with the ATM.
Public Offering
On October 13, 2021, the Company, entered
into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, as underwriter (the “Underwriter”),
relating to the issuance and sale of
3,750,000

Overview
We are a medical technology
company focused on the development and commercialization of thin film electrode technology for continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG)
and stereoelectrocencephalography (sEEG), spinal cord stimulation, brain stimulation and ablation solutions for patients suffering from
epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, essential tremors, chronic pain due to failed back surgeries and other related neurological
disorders. Additionally, we are investigating the potential applications of our technology associated with artificial intelligence.
In November 2019, our Evo cortical technology
received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for recording, monitoring, and stimulating brain tissue for up to 30 days, and in October 2022,
we received FDA clearance for our Evo sEEG electrode technology for temporary (less than 30 days) use with recording, monitoring, and
stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface level of the brain.
We completed feasibility bench top testing with
a new design of our diagnostic and ablation depth electrode in the first calendar quarter of 2021 and signed a contract with RBC Medical
Innovations to develop hardware for the system in the third calendar quarter of 2021. We are targeting the first calendar quarter of
2023 for design verification of such hardware. We also completed an animal feasibility study at Emory University in September 2021. Next,
we plan to complete additional animal studies through the first quarter of calendar 2023 and submit an application for FDA 510(k) clearance
in the second calendar quarter of 2023. Our other products are still under development.
We commenced commercial
sales of cEEG strip/grid and electrode cable assembly products beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. We sold, on a limited
application basis for design verification, sEEG depth electrode products for non-human use beginning in late fiscal year 2021, and we
commenced commercial sales of our sEEG depth electrode products in late calendar 2022. Our other products are still under development.
20
NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
Form 10-Q
We have incurred losses since inception. As of
December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $52.6 million, primarily as a result of expenses incurred in connection with our
research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses associated with our operations and interest expense, fair value
adjustments and loss on extinguishments related to our debt, offset in part by collaborations and product revenues.
Prior to FDA clearance
of certain of our products, our main sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were proceeds from the issuances of
notes, common stock, warrants and unsecured loans. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Resources” below. While
we have begun to generate revenue from the sale of products based on our cEEG and sEEG technology and through milestone and other
payments from our current collaboration with Zimmer, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating
and net losses for the foreseeable future until and unless we generate a higher level of revenue from commercial sales, and we will
need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations through public or private equity or debt financings,
through collaborations or partnerships with other companies or other sources.
We may be unable to
raise additional funds when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise such capital as and when needed would have a negative
impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop and commercialize our cortical strip, grid electrode and depth electrode
technology and future products and our ability to pursue our business strategy. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity
Outlook” below.
Recent Developments and Upcoming Milestones
Global Economic Conditions
Generally, worldwide
economic conditions remain uncertain, particularly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased inflation. The general economic
and capital market conditions both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in the past and at times have adversely affected our
access to capital and increased the cost of capital. The capital and credit markets may not be available to support future capital raising
activity on favorable terms or at all. If economic conditions decline, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital
markets could be adversely affected.
The COVID-19 pandemic
that began in late 2019 introduced significant volatility to the global economy, disrupted supply chains and had a widespread adverse
effect on the financial markets. Additionally, our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in the overall macroeconomic
environment and other economic factors. Changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, labor shortages,
the conflict in Ukraine, and steps taken by governments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well
as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which has led to an increase in costs and has caused changes in
fiscal and monetary policy, including increased interest rates.
Financial Overview
Product Revenue
Our product revenue was derived from the sale
of our strip and grid cortical electrodes (“Strip/Grid Products”), depth electrodes (“sEEG products”) and electrode
cable assembly products (“Electrode Cable Assembly Products”) based on Evo cortical technology. We anticipate that we will
generate additional revenue from the sale of products based on Evo cortical technology.
In November 2019, we received FDA 510(k) clearance
for our cortical strip electrode for temporary (less than 30 days) recording, monitoring, and stimulation on the surface of the brain.
In October 2022, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our Evo sEEG electrode technology for temporary (less than 30 days) use with recording,
monitoring, and stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface level of
the brain.
21
NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
Form 10-Q
Product Gross Loss
Product gross loss represents our product revenue
less our cost of product revenue. Our cost of product revenue consists of the manufacturing and materials costs incurred by our third-party
contract manufacturer in connection with our Strip/Grid Products and outside supplier materials costs of producing the Electrode Cable
Assembly Products. In addition, cost of product revenue includes royalty fees incurred in connection with our license agreements.
Collaborations Revenue
On July 20, 2020, we entered into an exclusive
development and distribution agreement (the “Zimmer Development Agreement”) with Zimmer, pursuant to which we granted Zimmer
exclusive global rights to distribute the Strip/Grid Products and electrode cable assembly products (the “Electrode Cable Assembly
Products”). Additionally, we granted Zimmer the exclusive right and license to distribute certain depth electrodes developed by
the Company (“sEEG Products”, and together with the Strip/Grid Products and Electrode Cable Assembly Products, the “Products”).
The parties have agreed to collaborate with respect to development activities under the Zimmer Development Agreement through a joint development
committee composed of an equal number of representatives of Zimmer and the Company.
Under the terms of the Zimmer Development Agreement,
we are responsible for all costs and expenses related to developing the Products, and Zimmer is responsible for all costs and expenses
related to the commercialization of the Products. In addition to the Zimmer Development Agreement, Zimmer and the Company have entered
into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “MS Agreement”) and a supplier quality agreement (the “Quality Agreement”)
with respect to the manufacturing and supply of the Products.
Except as otherwise provided in the Zimmer Development
Agreement, we are responsible for performing all development activities, including non-clinical and clinical studies directed at obtaining
regulatory approval of each Product. Zimmer has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote, market and sell each Product
following the “Product Availability Date” (as defined in the Zimmer Development Agreement) for such Product.
Pursuant to the Zimmer Development Agreement,
Zimmer made an upfront initial exclusivity fee payment of $2.0 million (the “Initial Exclusivity Fee”) to the Company
in fiscal year 2020. In addition, on August 2, 2022, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Zimmer Development Agreement (the “Amendment”)
with Zimmer. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Amendment, Zimmer made a $3.5 million payment to us in August 2022. In consideration
of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in the Zimmer Development Agreement, certain fee and milestone payment provisions in
the Zimmer Development Agreement were replaced with the following below:
●
$1.5 million for the sEEG exclusivity maintenance fee; and
●
$2.0 million for satisfaction of each of the milestone events related to the design of sEEG Products set forth in the Zimmer Development Agreement, even though the satisfaction was after the deadlines originally identified.
In addition, in connection with the Amendment,
we issued to Zimmer a warrant to purchase common stock (the “2022 Zimmer Warrant”). The 2022 Zimmer Warrant is exercisable
for up to an aggregate of 350,000 shares of our Common Stock. The 2022 Zimmer Warrant has an exercise price of $3.00 per
share, will be exercisable commencing six months from the issuance date, and will expire on August 2, 2027.
The Zimmer Development Agreement will expire on
the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the last Products to achieve a first commercial sale (the “Zimmer
Term”), unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. Either party may terminate the Zimmer Development Agreement (x) with written
notice for the other party’s material breach following a cure period or (y) if the other party becomes subject to certain insolvency
proceedings. In addition, Zimmer may terminate the Zimmer Development Agreement for any reason with 90 days’ written notice, and
the Company may terminate the Zimmer Development Agreement if Zimmer acquires or directly or indirectly owns a controlling interest in
certain competitors of the Company. The license rights granted to Zimmer under the Zimmer Development Agreement shall be exclusive from
the effective date of the Amendment until the end of the Zimmer Term.
22
NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
Form 10-Q
All payments attributed to the Initial Exclusivity
Fee, the sEEG exclusivity maintenance fee and sEEG design milestone payment are non-refundable.
The Zimmer Development Agreement and Amendment
were accounted for under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (“ASC 606”).
In accordance with the provisions under ASC 606, we identified five performance obligations under
the Zimmer Development Agreement and Amendment: (1) our obligation to grant Zimmer access to our intellectual property; (2) completion
of sEEG Product development; (3) completion of Strip/Grid Product development; (4) the provision of sEEG exclusivity maintenance; and
(5) sEEG design modifications as requested by Zimmer. All performance obligations under the Zimmer Development Agreement and Amendment
were met as of December 31, 2022.
In October 2022, we received 510(k) clearance
from the FDA for our Evo sEEG electrode technology for temporary (less than 30 days) use with recording, monitoring, and stimulation equipment
for the recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface level of the brain. Accordingly, we recognized
revenue in the amount of $1,455,188 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 related to the completion of the sEEG exclusivity
maintenance milestone. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized revenue in the amount of $6,374 related to sEEG
Product development.
The achievement of the level of sales required
to earn royalty payments from Zimmer is uncertain.
For further discussion about the determination
of collaborations revenue, product revenue and cost of product revenue, and for a discussion of milestones and royalty payments under
the Zimmer Development Agreement, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity Outlook” below and see “Note
7 — Zimmer Development Agreement” included in our condensed financial statements included in “Part 1, Item 1 –
Financial Statements” in this Report.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation for personnel in functions not directly associated with
research and development activities. Other significant costs include legal and litigation costs relating to corporate matters, intellectual
property costs, professional fees for consultants assisting with financial and administrative matters, and sales and marketing in connection
with the commercial sale of cEEG strip/grid, sEEG depth electrode and electrode cable assembly products. We anticipate that our selling,
general and administrative expenses will significantly increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities,
further commercialization of our cortical strip technology, our grid electrode technology, and our depth electrode technology, and the
increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel
and fees for legal and professional services, as well as other public company related costs.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist of
expenses incurred in performing research and development activities in developing our cortical strip, grid electrode and depth electrode
technology. Research and development expenses include compensation and benefits for research and development employees including stock-based
compensation, overhead expenses, cost of laboratory supplies, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, costs related
to regulatory operations, fees paid to consultants and other outside expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred
and costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Lastly, de minimis income from the sale of prototype
products and related materials are offset against research and development expenses.
We expect our research and development expenses
to significantly increase over the next several years as we develop our cortical strip, grid electrode and depth electrode technology
and conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials and will depend on the duration, costs and timing to complete our preclinical programs
and clinical trials.
Other Income
Other income primarily consists of interest income
related to our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and to proceeds outside of normal operating activity relating to legal
settlements and sales of non-commercial supplies.

Product Revenue and Product Gross Loss
Product revenue was approximately $0.1 million
and $34,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Product gross loss was approximately $(12,000) and
$(13,000) during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The product revenue consists of the sale of our strip/grid,
depth electrode and electrode cable assembly products. Cost of product revenue consisted of the manufacturing and materials costs incurred
by our third-party contract manufacturer in connection with our strip/grid and depth electrode products, and outside supplier materials
costs in connection with the electrode cable assembly products. In addition, cost of product revenue included royalty fees incurred of
approximately $38,000 and $26,000 in connection with our license agreements during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
Collaborations Revenue
Collaborations revenue was $1.5 million and $6,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue during each period was derived from the Zimmer Development
Agreement and represented the portion of the upfront initial development fee payment eligible for revenue recognition during such period.
The amount of revenue recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the completion of the sEEG maintenance fee obligation
as a result of securing FDA approval. For the comparable prior year period, the upfront fee was based on development completed in connection
with depth electrode products, and to a lesser extent, the strip/grid products.

NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
Form 10-Q
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses
were $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The $0.1 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in legal costs of $0.3 million and a decrease in professional services of $0.1
million, offset in part by increases in public company and other operating costs of $0.2 million and by increases in stock-based compensation
of $0.1 million.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses were $1.6 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.1 million during for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The $0.5
million increase period over period was attributed to supporting development activities, which primarily included salary-related expenses
and costs related to consulting services, materials and supplies associated with the development of depth electrode products and to a
lesser extent strip/grid products.
Other Income
Other income during the three months ended December
31, 2022 consisted of interest income in the amount of $52,000 attributed to our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments.
Other income during the three month period ended
December 31, 2021 consisted of $2,000 related primarily to interest income attributed to our cash deposits.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
As of December 31, 2022, our principal source
of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the aggregate of approximately $7.6 million. While we
began to generate revenue in fiscal year 2021 from commercial sales and through milestone and other payments under our collaboration
with Zimmer, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating and net losses for the foreseeable future until
and unless we generate an adequate level of revenue from commercial sales to cover expenses. Our most significant cash requirements relate
to the funding of our ongoing product development and commercialization operations and our royalty obligations under our intellectual
property licenses with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”) and the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and
Research (“Mayo”).  Our additional material cash needs include commitments under operating leases and other administrative
services. See “Funding Requirements” below for more information. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially
as we develop and commercialize our cortical strip, grid electrode and depth electrode technology and pursue pre-clinical and clinical
trials, seek regulatory approvals, manufacture products, establish our own sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize
our ablation electrode technology, hire additional staff, add operational, financial and management systems and continue to operate as
a public company.
Capital Resources
Our sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments to date have been limited to collaboration and product revenues, along with proceeds from the issuances of notes with warrants,
common stock with and without warrants and unsecured loans, with the terms of our most recent financings described below.
At-The-Market Offering
On December 21, 2022, we entered into a Capital
on Demand TM
Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC (“JonesTrading”) to create an at-the-market
offering program (“ATM”) under which we may offer and sell shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $14.5 million.
JonesTrading is entitled to a commission at a fixed commission rate equal to up to 3% of the gross proceeds. To date, no issuances of
securities have occurred under the ATM. Deferred issuance costs in the amount of $0.1 million have been incurred in connection with the
ATM.
October 2021 Underwritten Public Offering
On October 13, 2021, we entered into an underwriting
agreement relating to the issuance and sale of 3,750,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $3.20 per share (the
“October 2021 Underwritten Public Offering”). In addition, under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the
underwriter an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to an additional 562,500 shares of common stock on the same terms. The
base offering closed on October 15, 2021, and the sale of 422,057 shares of common stock subject to the underwriter’s overallotment
option closed on November 15, 2021. The gross proceeds from this offering were approximately $13.4 million prior to deducting underwriting
discounts and other offering expenses payable by us.

NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation
Form 10-Q
Funding Requirements
As noted above, certain
of our cash requirements relate to the funding of our ongoing product development and commercialization operations and our milestone
and royalty obligations under our intellectual property licenses with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”) and
the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”).  See “Item 1—Business—Clinical Development
and Regulatory Pathway—Clinical Experience, Future Development and Clinical Trial Plans” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended September 30, 2022 for a discussion of design, development, pre-clinical and clinical activities that we may conduct
in the future, including expected cash expenditures required for some of those activities, to the extent we are able to estimate such
costs.
On January 22, 2020,
we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement (the “WARF License”) with WARF, which amended and restated in full
our prior license agreement with WARF, dated October 1, 2014 (the “Original WARF License”). Under the WARF License, we have
agreed to pay WARF a royalty equal to a single-digit percentage of our product sales pursuant to the WARF License, with a minimum annual
royalty payment of $50,000 for 2020, $100,000 for 2021 and $150,000 for 2022 and each calendar year thereafter that the WARF License
is in effect. If we or any of our sublicensees contest the validity of any licensed patent, the royalty rate will be doubled during the
pendency of such contest and, if the contested patent is found to be valid and would be infringed by us if not for the WARF License,
the royalty rate will be tripled for the remaining term of the WARF License.
Under the Amended and
Restated License and Development Agreement with Mayo (the “Mayo Development Agreement”), we have agreed to pay Mayo a royalty
equal to a single-digit percentage of our product sales pursuant to the Mayo Development Agreement. See “Note 4 – Commitments
and Contingencies” included in our condensed financial statements included in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements”
in this Report for more information about the WARF License and the Mayo Development Agreement.
Our other cash requirements
within the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued expenses, purchase commitments and other current liabilities. Our other
cash requirements greater than twelve months from various contractual obligations and commitments include operating leases and contracted
services. Refer to “Note 4 – Commitments and Contingencies” included in our condensed financial statements included
in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements” in this Report for further detail of our lease obligations and the timing
of expected future payments. Contracted services include agreements with third-party service providers for clinical research, product
development, manufacturing, supplies, payroll services, equipment maintenance services, and audits for periods up to fiscal year 2024.
We expect to satisfy
our short-term and long-term obligations through cash on hand and, until we generate an adequate level of revenue from commercial sales
to cover expenses, if ever, from future equity and debt financings.
Liquidity Outlook
For a discussion of potential fee payments under
the Zimmer Development Agreement, see “Note 7 — Zimmer Development Agreement” included in our condensed financial statements
included in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements” in this Report. Even though we have received regulatory clearance
to expand the use of our Evo sEEG Electrode technology for up to 30 days, commercial sales of the sEEG Electrodes are expected to take
some time to be a significant source of liquidity. Zimmer has exclusive global rights to distribute our strip and grid cortical electrodes,
depth electrodes and electrode cable assembly products. Zimmer’s failure to timely develop or commercialize these products would
have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.

in the report on our financial statements as of and for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, noting the existence
of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses through at least twelve months from the date of this filing. To continue to fund
operations, we will need to secure additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings, through collaborations or
partnerships with other companies or other sources. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Any failure to raise capital when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan. If we are unable to raise additional
funds, or if our anticipated operating results are not achieved, we believe planned expenditures may need to be reduced in order to extend
the time period that existing resources can fund our operations. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital, it may have a material
adverse effect on our operations and the development of our technology, or we may have to cease operations altogether.
The development and commercialization of our
cortical strip, grid electrode and depth electrode technology is subject to numerous uncertainties, and we could use our cash, cash equivalent
and short-term investment resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of developing medical devices is costly, and the
timing of progress in pre-clinical tests and clinical trials is uncertain. Our ability to successfully transition to profitability will
be dependent upon achieving further regulatory approvals and achieving a level of product sales adequate to support our cost structure.
We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.

Net cash used in operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $3.5
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, which consisted of a net loss of $1.7 million partially offset by non-cash stock-based
compensation, depreciation, amortization related to intangible assets, short-term investment discount and premium amortization, and non-cash
lease expense, totaling approximately $0.3 million in the aggregate. The net change in our net operating assets and liabilities associated
with fluctuations in our operating activities resulted in a net cash use of $2.1 million. The net cash use stemming from the change in
operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred revenue in connection with the completion of the
remaining milestone performance obligation under the Zimmer Development Agreement, and to a lesser extent, to an increase in inventory
purchases and to a net decrease in the aggregate of account payable, accrued expenses, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses attributed
to the timing of payments.
Net cash used in operating activities was $2.7
million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of a net loss of $2.8 million partially offset by non-cash stock-based
compensation, depreciation, amortization related to intangible assets and operating lease expense, totaling approximately $0.3 million
in the aggregate. The net change in our net operating assets and liabilities associated with fluctuations in our operating activities
resulted in a cash use of $0.1 million. The net cash use stemming from the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable
to an increase in inventory purchases, net decrease in account payable and accrued expenses attributed to the timing of payments, partially
offset by a decrease in accounts receivable in connection with the Zimmer Development Agreement.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue
and expense during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonably based upon information
available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent that there are material differences between these
estimates and actual results, our financial results will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates
and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results
are described in Note 3 — “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our condensed financial statements included
in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements” in this Report.
Of these policies, the following are considered
critical to an understanding of our condensed financial statements included in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements”
in this Report as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments:
Revenues:
For discussion about the determination of collaborations
revenue, product revenue and cost of product revenue, see “Note 7 — Zimmer Development Agreement” included in our condensed
financial statements included in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements” in this Report. To date, we have not had,
nor expect to have in the future, significant variable consideration adjustments related to product revenue, such as chargebacks, sales
allowances and sales returns.
Stock-based Compensation
For discussions about the application of grant
date fair value associated with our stock-based compensation, see “Note 8 — Stock-Based Compensation” included in our
condensed financial statements included in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements” in this Report.
Income Tax Assets and Liabilities
Income tax assets and liabilities include income
tax valuation allowances. For additional information, see “Note 10 — Income Taxes” included in our condensed financial
statements included in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements” in this Report and “Note 11 – Income Taxes”
in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Contingencies
We are subject to numerous contingencies arising
in the ordinary course of business, including legal contingencies. For additional information, see “Note 4 — Commitments
and Contingencies” included in our condensed financial statements included in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements”
in this Report.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to “Note 3— Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies” to our condensed financial statements included in “Part 1, Item 1 – Financial Statements”
in this Report for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Not applicable for smaller reporting companies.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer, we have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to the material weakness in our internal
controls over financial reporting related to our verification process concerning wire transfer payments to vendors as discussed further
below. Notwithstanding this material weakness, our management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.
In January 2023, we became aware that we had been
a victim of a criminal fraud that law enforcement authorities refer to as business email compromise fraud, which involved impersonation
of our vendor and fraudulent demands for wire transfers that targeted our finance department. The fraud resulted in a loss of approximately
$0.1 million. The Company’s investigation into this matter continues as further discussed in Item 1A.
Remediation
During the second fiscal quarter of 2023, enhancements
were made to our controls relating to electronic payments, including by wire transfer of funds. These enhancements include additional
verification and documentation procedures to be followed prior to the initiation or approval of electronic payments by or for us. We believe
these enhancements increase the ability of our personnel to identify and block attempts by third parties to fraudulently initiate electronic
payments from us. Our management believes that the foregoing actions will help improve our internal controls over financial reporting.
We are actively working to implement effective internal control over financial reporting, which includes remediation of the material weakness.
However, such compliance is not guaranteed, and we cannot provide any assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will
be effective as a result of these efforts.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
Other than the identification of the material
weakness described above, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal
proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion
of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse
impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth
below and elsewhere in this Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors”
of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. Such factors, if they were to occur, could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements in this Report, and materially adversely
affect our financial condition or future results. Although we are not aware of any other factors that we currently anticipate will cause
our forward-looking statements to differ materially from our future actual results, or materially affect the Company’s financial
condition or future results, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial
might materially adversely affect our actual business, financial condition and/or operating results.
We have been the victim of a cyber-related crime and our controls
may not be successful in avoiding further cyber-related crimes in the future.
In January 2023, we were the victim of a business
email compromise fraud which resulted in our incurring a loss of approximately $0.1 million. We are working with law enforcement authorities
and the banks involved in the wire transfer to pursue recovery of the $0.1 million, but at this time we do not know whether we will be
able to recover such funds. Enhancements have been made to our controls relating to electronic payments by or for us that we believe will
reduce our risk of becoming a victim of future frauds related to our payments, including by wire transfers. However, cyber-related criminal
activities continue to evolve and increase in sophistication, frequency and severity. As a result, the control enhancements that have
been made, and any additional enhancements that may be made in the future, to our controls may not be successful in avoiding our becoming
a victim to further cyber-related crimes.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds
None.
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities
None.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Not applicable to our Company.
Item 5. Other Information
The Company expects to hold its 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
(the “Annual Meeting”) on Thursday, March 16, 2023 and has fixed the closing of business on January 17, 2023 as the record
date for the Annual Meeting. Because the date of the Annual Meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of
the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company is providing the due date for submission of any qualified stockholder proposal.
Pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
rules and the Company’s bylaws, the deadline for the submission of proposals to be included in the Company’s proxy materials
is the close of business on December 27, 2022, and the deadline for the submission of director nominations to be brought before the Annual
Meeting by a stockholder is the close of business on January 15, 2023. Written notice for any such proposals, nominations or other business
must be received by the Company at its principal executive office (NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation, Attention: Secretary, 7599
Anagram Dr., Eden Prairie, MN 55344) by the applicable deadline and must comply with the procedures and requirements of applicable SEC
rules and the Company’s bylaws.
