million (collectively, the "Credit Facility"), that was fully repaid in fiscal 2022. 11 Table of Contents QORVO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) On April 6, 2022, the Company and the administrative agent entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "LIBOR Transition Amendment") to replace the London Interbank Offered Rate as a reference rate available for use in the computation of interest under the Credit Agreement.
As a result of the LIBOR Transition Amendment, at the Company’s option, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (i) the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus the Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the Applicable Rate plus a rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus
0.50 %, (b) the prime rate as set by the administrative agent, and (c) the Term SOFR plus
1.0 % (the "Base Rate").
All swing line loans will bear interest at a rate equal to the Applicable Rate plus the Base Rate.
The Term SOFR is the rate per annum equal to the forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate term rate for interest periods of one, three or six months (as selected by the Company) plus an adjustment (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
The Applicable Rate for Term SOFR loans ranges from
1.000 % per annum to
1.250 % per annum, and the Applicable Rate for Base Rate loans ranges from
0.000 % per annum to
0.250 % per annum.
Undrawn amounts under the Credit Facility are subject to a commitment fee ranging from
0.150 % to
0.200 %. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, there were
no
borrowings under the Revolving Facility. Senior Notes due 2024 On

The 2031 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors. 12 Table of Contents QORVO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) The 2031 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of September 29, 2020, by and among the Company, the Guarantors and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "2020 Indenture").

$11.8 million
during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022. Fair Value of Long-Term Debt The Company's debt is carried at amortized cost and is measured quarterly at fair value for disclosure purposes.
The estimated fair value of the 2024 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes as of December 31, 2022 was $ 459.8
million, $ 777.8
million and $ 572.3
million, respectively (compared to the outstanding principal amount of $ 500.0
million, $ 850.0
million and $ 700.0
million, respectively).
The estimated fair value of the 2024 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes as of April 2, 2022 was $ 476.9
million, $ 852.6
million and $ 638.6
million, respectively (compared to the outstanding principal amount of $ 500.0
million, $ 850.0
million and $ 700.0
million, respectively).
The Company considers its debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
The 2024 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes currently trade over-the-counter, and the fair values were estimated based upon the value of the last trade at the end of the period. Interest Expense During the
three and
nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized total interest expense of
$ 18.1
million and $54.2 million, re spectively, primarily related to the 2024 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, partially offset by interest capitalized to property and equipment of $ 1.0
million and $ 3.0
million, respectively.
During the
three and
nine months ended January 1, 2022, the Company recognized total interest expense of $ 16.3
million and $ 48.7
million, respectively, primarily related to the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, partially offset by interest capitalized to property and equipment of $ 0.9
million and $ 2.8
million, respectively. 7. STOCK REPURCHASES On November 2, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $ 2.0
billion of the Company's outstanding common stock, which included the remaining authorized dollar amount under a prior program terminated concurrent with the new authorization.
Under the current program, share repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases depends on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations.
The program does not require the Company to repurchase a minimum number of shares, does not have a fixed term, and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately
2.2
million and
7.2
million shares of its common stock for approximately $ 201.6
million and $ 711.7
million, respectively (including transaction costs) under the prior and current share repurchase programs.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 1,855.0
million remains available for repurchases under the current share repurchase program. During the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately
1.9
million and
4.8
million shares, respectively, of its common stock for approximately $ 302.0
million and $ 825.4
million, respectively (including transaction costs). 8.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Purchase Obligations Amidst ongoing industry-wide supply constraints, the Company entered into a long-term capacity reservation agreement with a foundry supplier during the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Under this agreement, the Company was required to purchase, and
13 Table of Contents QORVO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) the foundry supplier was required to supply, a certain number of wafers (at predetermined sales prices) for calendar years 2022 through 2025.
In connection with this agreement, the Company paid a refundable deposit (which was recorded in "Other non-current assets" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets), and if the purchase commitments per the agreement were not met, under certain circumstances the supplier could deduct the amount of the purchase shortfall from the prepaid refundable deposit at the end of each calendar year. During fiscal 2023, the Company has experienced unexpectedly weakened demand for 5G handsets in China and EMEA primarily due to unprecedented disruption resulting from measures taken in China to control the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.
As a result, the Company did not meet the minimum purchase commitments under this long-term capacity reservation agreement. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the purchase shortfall resulted in an impairment to the prepaid refundable deposit of approximately $ 13.0  million and additional reserves of approximately $ 11.0  million for inventory in excess of demand forecasts were recorded.
Additionally, the Company assessed the future minimum purchase commitments over the remaining term of the agreement and recorded an estimated shortfall of $ 86.0  million, of which $ 8.0  million was recorded in "Other current liabilities" and $ 78.0  million was recorded in "Other long-term liabilities" in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 330, " Inventory. "
These transactions resulted in a total increase to cost of goods sold of $ 110.0  million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
In October 2022, the Company renegotiated the terms of the agreement with the foundry supplier, which included extending the duration of the agreement through calendar year 2026.
The Company believes that the amended agreement more closely aligns the contractual purchase commitments with forecasted demand.
As a result of the amended agreement, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded an impairment to the prepaid refundable deposit of approximately $ 38.0  million and additional reserves of approximately $ 5.0  million for inventory in excess of demand forecasts, which reduced the estimated shortfall liability that was previously recorded by $ 43.0  million.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded an impairment to the prepaid refundable deposit of approximately $ 8.0  million and additional reserves of approximately $ 4.0  million for inventory in excess of demand forecasts, which reduced the estimated shortfall liability that was previously recorded by $ 12.0  million.
There was no impact to the statements of operations in the second or third quarters of fiscal 2023.
There were no material changes to the Company's estimated future purchase obligations under the current terms of the capacity reservation agreement during the current quarter. In performing these assessments, the Company considered Company-specific forecasts, legal obligations, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors as well as market and industry trends.
These factors include significant management judgment and estimates and, to the extent that these assumptions are incorrect or there are further declines in management's demand forecasts, additional charges may be recorded in future periods.
Legal Matters The Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business that have not been fully adjudicated.
The Company accrues a liability for legal contingencies when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
The Company regularly evaluates developments in its legal matters that could affect the amount of the previously accrued liability and records adjustments as appropriate.
Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the unresolved legal matters, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal matters is not material. 14 Table of Contents QORVO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) 9.

OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company updated its organizational structure from two operating segments (Mobile Products and Infrastructure and Defense Products) to three operating segments (High Performance Analog ("HPA"), Connectivity and Sensors Group ("CSG") and Advanced Cellular Group ("ACG")).
This change was made to more closely align similar technologies and applications with customers and end markets, which represents how the Company currently manages its three operating segments (which are also its reportable segments).
The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is also the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), allocates resources and evaluates the performance of each of the three operating segments primarily based on operating income.
All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these three operating segments. HPA is a leading global supplier of RF and power management solutions for infrastructure, defense and aerospace, automotive power and other markets.
HPA leverages a diverse portfolio of differentiated technologies and products to support multiyear growth trends, including electrification, renewable energy, the increasing semiconductor spend in defense and 5G deployments outside of China. CSG is a leading global supplier of connectivity and sensor components and systems featuring multiple technologies such as UWB, Matter ® , Bluetooth ®
Low Energy, Zigbee ® , Thread ® , Wi-Fi ® , cellular IoT and MEMS-/BAW-based sensors.
CSG combines the connectivity and sensors businesses formerly split between Mobile Products and Infrastructure and Defense Products.
CSG’s markets include smart home, automotive connectivity, industrial automation, smartphones, wearables, gaming and other high-growth IoT connectivity and healthcare markets.
ACG is a leading global supplier of cellular RF solutions for smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and various other devices.
ACG leverages world-class technology and systems-level expertise to deliver a broad portfolio of high performance cellular products to the world's leading smartphone and consumer electronics companies.
ACG is a highly diversified supplier of custom and open market cellular solutions, serving iOS and Android original equipment manufacturers. The "All other" category includes operating expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring related charges, acquisition and integration related costs, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement, fixed asset impairments, gain (loss) on sale of fixed assets, start-up costs and other miscellaneous corporate overhead expenses that the Company does not allocate to its reportable segments because these expenses are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by the Company’s CODM.
The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information.
The Company’s operating segments do not record intercompany revenue.
The Company does not allocate gains and losses from investments, interest expense, other (expense) income, or taxes to operating segments.
Except as discussed above regarding the "All other" category, the Company’s accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole. 16 Table of Contents QORVO, INC.

INCOME TAXES The Company’s income tax expense was $ 13.2
million and $ 82.1
million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and $ 67.0
million and $ 112.5
million, for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022, respectively.
The Company’s effective tax rate was ( 474.1 )% and
25.4 % for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and
23.6 % and
12.1 % for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax rate differences in foreign jurisdictions, global intangible low tax income ("GILTI"), domestic tax credits generated and discrete tax items recorded during the period.
A discrete tax expense of $ 2.2
million and a discrete tax benefit of $ 10.4
million was recorded for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022.
The discrete tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily resulted from foreign currency gains recognized for tax purposes.
The discrete tax benefit for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily resulted from certain charges associated with a long-term
17 Table of Contents QORVO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) capacity reservation agreement (refer to Note 8 for further information), partially offset by foreign currency gains recognized for tax purposes. The Company's effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022 differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax rate differences in foreign jurisdictions, GILTI, domestic tax credits and discrete tax items recorded during the period.
A discrete tax expense of $ 42.5
million and $ 12.0
million was recorded during the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022, respectively.
The discrete tax expense for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022 primarily related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the extension of the Company’s tax holiday in Singapore.
The discrete tax expense for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 was partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, stock-based compensation deductions and net tax benefits associated with other non-recurring restructuring activities, including a discrete charge associated with the intercompany restructuring of the NextInput intellectual property. 13.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Qorvo is a global leader in the development and commercialization of technologies and products for wireless, wired and power markets. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we updated our organizational structure to more closely align similar technologies and applications with customers and end markets.
We manage our business and report our financial results in three reportable segments:
High Performance Analog ("HPA"), Connectivity and Sensors Group ("CSG") and Advanced Cellular Group ("ACG").
Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our reportable operating segments as of
December 31, 2022. HPA is a leading global supplier of RF and power management solutions for infrastructure, defense and aerospace, automotive power and other markets.
HPA leverages a diverse portfolio of differentiated technologies and products to support multiyear growth trends, including electrification, renewable energy, the increasing semiconductor spend in defense and 5G deployments outside of China. CSG is a leading global supplier of connectivity and sensor components and systems featuring multiple technologies such as UWB, Matter ® , Bluetooth ®
Low Energy, Zigbee ® , Thread ® , Wi-Fi ® , cellular IoT and MEMS-/BAW-based sensors.
CSG combines the connectivity and sensors businesses formerly split between Mobile Products and Infrastructure and Defense Products.
CSG’s markets include smart home, automotive connectivity, industrial automation, smartphones, wearables, gaming and other high-growth IoT connectivity and healthcare markets.
ACG is a leading global supplier of cellular RF solutions for smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and various other devices.
ACG leverages world-class technology and systems-level expertise to deliver a broad portfolio of high performance cellular products to the world's leading smartphone and consumer electronics companies.
ACG is a highly diversified supplier of custom and open market cellular solutions serving iOS and Android original equipment manufacturers. As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on May 20, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the semiconductor industry supply chain, causing uncertainty in customer demand, worldwide economies and financial markets.
During fiscal 2023, we have experienced unexpectedly weakened demand for 5G handsets in China and EMEA due to unprecedented disruption resulting from measures taken in China to control the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.
As a result, we did not meet the minimum purchase commitments under a long-term capacity reservation agreement with a foundry supplier.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the purchase shortfall resulted in an impairment to the prepaid refundable deposit of approximately $13.0 million and additional reserves of approximately $11.0 million for inventory in excess of demand forecasts were recorded.
Additionally, we assessed the future minimum purchase commitments over the remaining term of the agreement and recorded an estimated shortfall of $86.0 million in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 330, " Inventory."
These transactions resulted in a total increase to cost of goods sold of $110.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
In October 2022, we renegotiated the terms of the agreement with the foundry supplier, which included extending the duration of the agreement through calendar year 2026.
We believe that the amended agreement more closely aligns the contractual purchase commitments with our forecasted demand.
As a result of the amended agreement, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded an impairment to the prepaid refundable deposit of approximately $38.0 million and additional reserves of approximately $5.0 million for inventory in excess of demand forecasts, which reduced the estimated shortfall liability that was previously recorded by $43.0 million.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded an impairment to the prepaid refundable deposit of approximately $8.0 million and additional reserves of approximately $4.0 million for inventory in excess of demand forecasts, which reduced the estimated shortfall liability that was previously recorded by $12.0 million.
There was no impact to the statements of operations in the second or third quarters of fiscal 2023.
In performing these assessments, we considered Company-specific forecasts, legal obligations, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors as well as market and industry trends.
These factors include significant management judgment and estimates and, to the extent that these assumptions are incorrect or there are further declines in management's demand forecasts, additional charges may be recorded in future periods.
20 Table of Contents THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2023 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS • Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 33.3% as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to ongoing global macroeconomic challenges which resulted in lower demand for 5G handsets and other consumer facing products, such as Wi-Fi.
Demand was also negatively impacted by ongoing efforts to consume channel inventories. • Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased to 36.1% as compared to 49.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to factory underutilization costs resulting from lower production levels, as well as inventory charges related to demand fluctuations and a quality issue from a third-party supplier.
These decreases to gross margin were partially offset by favorable changes in product mix.
• Operating income was $8.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to $296.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
This decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and lower gross margin. • Net loss per share was $0.16 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to net income per diluted share of $1.95 for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. • Capital expenditures were $34.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to $50.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. • During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $201.6 million. 21 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated The following tables present a summary of our results of operations (in thousands, except percentages):     Three Months Ended                        December 31, 2022 % of Revenue January 1, 2022 % of Revenue Increase (Decrease) Percentage Change Revenue $ 743,281   100.0  % $ 1,113,957   100.0  % $ (370,676) (33.3) % Cost of goods sold 475,230   63.9  565,864   50.8  (90,634) (16.0) Gross profit 268,051  36.1  548,093  49.2  (280,042) (51.1) Research and development 149,472   20.1  154,435   13.9  (4,963) (3.2) Selling, general and administrative 76,269   10.3  82,003   7.3  (5,734) (7.0) Other operating expense 33,581   4.5  15,645   1.4  17,936  114.6  Operating income $ 8,729  1.2  % $ 296,010  26.6  % $ (287,281) (97.1) % Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 % of Revenue January 1, 2022 % of Revenue Increase (Decrease) Percentage Change Revenue $ 2,936,696   100.0  % $ 3,479,556   100.0  % $ (542,860) (15.6) % Cost of goods sold 1,754,468   59.7  1,763,727   50.7  (9,259) (0.5) Gross profit 1,182,228  40.3  1,715,829  49.3  (533,601) (31.1) Research and development 486,204   16.6  464,891   13.4  21,313  4.6  Selling, general and administrative 275,836   9.4  265,791   7.6  10,045  3.8  Other operating expense 48,038   1.6  29,675   0.8  18,363  61.9  Operating income $ 372,150  12.7  % $ 955,472  27.5  % $ (583,322) (61.1) % Revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022, primarily due to ongoing global macroeconomic challenges (including the measures taken in China to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine and the negative impact of higher inflation on consumer spending) which resulted in lower demand for 5G handsets and other consumer facing products, such as Wi-Fi.
Demand was also negatively impacted by ongoing efforts to consume channel inventories.
The decreased revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the nine months ended January 1, 2022, was partially offset by content gains in mass-tier handsets and higher demand for our defense and silicon carbide ("SiC")-based power management products. Gross margin decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three months ended January 1, 2022, primarily due to factory underutilization costs resulting from lower production levels, as well as inventory charges related to demand fluctuations and a quality issue from a third-party supplier.
These decreases to gross margin were partially offset by favorable changes in product mix.
Gross margin decreased for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the nine months ended January 1, 2022, primarily due to charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement, factory underutilization costs resulting from lower production levels, as well as inventory charges related to demand fluctuations and quality issues from third-party suppliers.
These decreases to gross margin were partially offset by favorable changes in product mix. Operating expenses increased for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three months ended January 1, 2022, primarily due to restructuring charges (see Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), partially offset by lower employee-related costs. 22 Table of Contents Operating expenses increased for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the nine months ended January 1, 2022, primarily due to employee-related costs and restructuring charges.
Travel expenses also increased during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as travel restrictions and our policies originally implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have eased.

During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded interest expense primarily related to our
1.750%
senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes"), our 4.375% senior notes due 2029 (the "2029 Notes") and our
3.375% senior notes due 2031 (the "2031 Notes").
During the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022, we recorded interest expense primarily related to our 2029 Notes and our
2031 Notes.
Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other income, net Other income is primarily attributed to interest income as well as gains (losses) from our share of investments in limited partnerships and gains (losses) from other investments.
Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income tax expense
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $13.2 million and $82.1 million, respectively, comprised primarily of tax expense related
to
international operations generating pre-tax book
income
and the impact of global intangible low tax income, partially offset by tax benefits related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax book losses and domestic tax credits and discrete tax items recorded during the period.
The discrete tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily resulted from foreign currency gains recognized for tax purposes.
The discrete tax benefit for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily resulted from certain charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement (refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), partially offset by foreign currency gains recognized for tax purposes. During the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $67.0 million and $112.5 million, respectively, comprised primarily of tax expense related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax book income and discrete charges recorded during the period, partially offset by tax benefits related to international operations generating pre-tax book losses and domestic tax credits.
The discrete tax expense for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022 primarily related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the extension of the Company’s tax holiday in Singapore through December 31, 2031.
The discrete tax expense for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 was partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, stock-based compensation deductions and net tax benefits associated with other non-recurring restructuring activities, including a discrete charge associated with the intercompany restructuring of the NextInput, Inc. ("NextInput") intellectual property. A valuation allowance remained against certain domestic and foreign net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity.
As of December 31, 2022, we had working capital of approximately $1,644.1 million, including $918.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to working capital of approximately $1,774.7 million, including $972.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as of April 2, 2022. Our $918.8 million of total cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, includes approximately $755.1 million held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $585.0 million is held by Qorvo International Pte. Ltd. in Singapore.
If the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the U.S., we may be required to pay state income and/or foreign local withholding taxes to repatriate these earnings. Stock Repurchases During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $711.7 million (including transaction costs) under the prior and current share repurchase programs.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately $1,855.0 million remains available for repurchases under the current program. 25 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $777.8 million and $703.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively.
This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by decreased profitability.
In the nine months ended January 1, 2022, cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to prepayments of certain fees and deposits associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $117.4 million and $552.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively.

On September 29, 2020, we and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") entered into a five-year unsecured senior credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement (as amended, restated, modified or otherwise supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., acting as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders.
The Credit Agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated as of December 5, 2017.
The Credit Agreement includes a senior revolving line of credit (the "Revolving Facility") of up to $300.0 million and included a senior term loan of $200.0 million (collectively, the "Credit Facility") which was fully repaid in fiscal 2022.
The Revolving Facility includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swing line loans.
The Credit Facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we may request one or more additional tranches of term loans or increases to the Revolving Facility, up to an aggregate of $500.0 million and subject to, among other things, securing additional funding commitments from the existing or new lenders. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Facility. The Credit Agreement contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default.
As of
December 31, 2022 , we were in compliance with these covenants. 2024 Notes
On December 14, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes.
Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year at a rate of 1.750% per annum.
The 2024 Notes will mature on December 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms.

As of December 31, 2022, we had capital commitments of approximately $84.9 million primarily for expanding capability to support new products, equipment and facility upgrades and cost savings initiatives. Purchase Obligations
Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our purchase obligations. Future Sources of Funding
Our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently projected and will depend on many factors, including market acceptance of and demand for our products, acquisition opportunities, technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers.
Based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operations, coupled with our existing cash, cash equivalents and our Credit Facility, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our short-term and long-term cash requirements.
However, if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products, or if our demand grows faster than we anticipate, operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs.
If existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable, we may seek additional debt or equity financing.
Additional debt or equity financing could be dilutive to holders of our common stock.
Further, we cannot be sure that any additional debt or equity financing, if required, will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Legal
We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business that have not been fully adjudicated.
We accrue a liability for legal contingencies when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
We regularly evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of the previously accrued liability and record adjustments as appropriate.
Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the unresolved legal matters, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
We believe the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal matters is not material. Taxes
We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions.
Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions.
Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
We are subject to audits by tax authorities.
While we endeavor to comply with all applicable tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law than we do or that we will comply in all respects with applicable tax laws, which could result in additional taxes.
There can be no assurance that the outcomes from tax audits will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period during which the review is conducted. SUPPLEMENTAL PARENT AND GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION In accordance with the indentures governing the 2024 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes (together, the "Notes"), our obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several unsecured basis by the Guarantors, which are listed on Exhibit 22 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Each Guarantor is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by Qorvo, Inc. ("Parent").
A Guarantor can be released in certain customary circumstances.
Our other U.S. subsidiaries and our non-U.S. subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes (such subsidiaries are referred to as the "Non-Guarantors"). 27 Table of Contents The following presents summarized financial information for the Parent and the Guarantors on a combined basis as of and for the periods indicated, after eliminating (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent and Guarantors, and (ii) equity earnings from, and investments in, any Non-Guarantor.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," contained in Qorvo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2022. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of such date, to enable the Company to record, process, summarize and report in a timely manner the information that the Company is required to disclose in its Exchange Act reports, and to accumulate and communicate such information to management, including the Company’s CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 29 Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Other than the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors identified in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors" in Qorvo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2022. We are subject to inventory risks and costs because we purchase materials and build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products. In order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest end customers, we purchase materials and start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers.
However, these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer.
As a result, we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales.
Because demand for our products may not materialize, or may be lower than expected, purchasing materials and manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs, increased obsolescence and higher operating costs.
These inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers’ accumulated levels of inventory.
For example, amidst ongoing industry-wide supply constraints, we entered into a long-term capacity reservation agreement with a foundry supplier during the second quarter ended October 2, 2021.
Under the agreement we were required to purchase, and the supplier was required to supply, a certain number of wafers for calendar years 2022 through 2025.
In connection with this agreement, we paid a refundable deposit and if the purchase commitments per the agreement were not met, under certain circumstances the supplier could deduct the amount of the purchase shortfall from the prepaid refundable deposit at the end of each calendar year. During fiscal 2023, we have experienced unexpectedly weakened demand for 5G handsets in China and EMEA due to unprecedented disruption resulting from measures taken in China to control the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.
As a result, we did not meet the minimum purchase commitments under this agreement, which resulted in the recognition of purchase shortfalls and an increase to our cost of goods sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
In October 2022, we renegotiated the terms of the agreement with the foundry supplier, which included extending the duration of the agreement through calendar year 2026.
We believe that the amended agreement more closely aligns the contractual purchase commitments with our forecasted demand.
To the extent that management’s assumptions pertaining to anticipated future demand are incorrect or there are further declines in management's demand forecasts, additional charges may be recorded in future periods, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results.

Under the current program, share repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
The extent to which we repurchase our shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases depends on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations.
The program does not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares, does not have a fixed term, and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. ITEM 5.
