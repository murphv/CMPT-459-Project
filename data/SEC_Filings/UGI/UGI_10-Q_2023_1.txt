Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. They include all adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Such adjustments consisted only of normal recurring items unless otherwise disclosed. The September 30, 2022, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report. Due to the seasonal nature of our businesses, the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. Restricted Cash.
Restricted cash principally represents those cash balances in our commodity futures brokerage accounts that are restricted from withdrawal.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to the corresponding amounts reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 317   $ 334   Restricted cash 227   24   Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 544   $ 358   10 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Earnings Per Common Share.
Basic earnings per share attributable to UGI stockholders reflect the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share attributable to UGI stockholders include the effects of dilutive stock options, common stock awards and Equity Units.
Shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Denominator (thousands of shares): Weighted-average common shares outstanding — basic 209,934   209,673   Incremental shares issuable for stock options, common stock awards and Equity Units (a) —   —   Weighted-average common shares outstanding — diluted 209,934   209,673   (a) For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
6,431
and
6,486 , respectively, of such shares have been excluded as these incremental shares would be antidilutive due to the net losses for the periods presented. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these incremental shares exclude the effects of
6,625
and
3,347
shares, respectively, associated with outstanding stock option awards because their effect was antidilutive. Equity Method Investments.
We account for privately held equity securities of entities without readily determinable fair values in which we do not have control, but have significant influence over operating and financial policies, under the equity method. These are included in "Other assets" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity method earnings are included in "Income from equity method investees" on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Our equity method investments primarily comprise Pine Run and other equity method investments in biomass and other renewable energy projects.
Pine Run.
The Company has an approximately
49 % interest in Pine Run, a company jointly owned by Stonehenge Energy Resources and UGI Pine Run LLC. Pine Run owns Pine Run Midstream which operates dry gas gathering pipelines and compression assets in western Pennsylvania. Pine Run is accounted for as an equity method investment as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the entity. The carrying value of our investment in Pine Run at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 71
and $ 62 , respectively.
At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Pennant was $ 99 . During Fiscal 2022, UGI through its wholly owned indirect subsidiary, Energy Services, completed the Pennant Acquisition in which Energy Services acquired the remaining
53 % of the equity interests in Pennant. The acquisition of the remaining interests was accounted for as an acquisition of assets, and the purchase price of approximately $ 61
was primarily allocated to property, plant and equipment. Our other equity method investments totaled $ 104
and $ 22
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and principally comprise of a number of investments in biomass and other renewable energy projects at Midstream & Marketing and a renewable energy joint venture at UGI International. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these investments is limited to the amount invested.
Derivative Instruments.
Derivative instruments are reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values, unless the NPNS exception is elected.
The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument, whether it is subject to regulatory ratemaking mechanisms or if it qualifies and is designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. Certain of our derivative instruments qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are recorded in AOCI, to the extent effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item, until earnings are affected by the hedged item.
We discontinue cash flow hedge accounting if occurrence of the forecasted transaction is determined to be no longer probable. Hedge accounting is also discontinued for derivatives that cease to be highly effective. We do not designate our commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments as hedges under GAAP. Changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments are reflected in net income. Gains and losses on substantially all of the commodity derivative instruments used by Utilities are included in regulatory assets or liabilities because it is probable such gains or losses will be recoverable from, or refundable to, customers. From time to time, we also enter into net investment hedges. Gains and losses on net investment hedges that relate to our foreign operations are included in the cumulative translation adjustment component in AOCI until such foreign net investment is substantially sold or liquidated. 11 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Cash flows from derivative instruments, other than certain cross-currency swaps and net investment hedges, if any, are included in cash flows from operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash flows from the interest portion of our cross-currency hedges, if any, are included in cash flows from operating activities while cash flows from the currency portion of such hedges, if any, are included in cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows from net investment hedges, if any, are included in cash flows from investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For a more detailed description of the derivative instruments we use, our accounting for derivatives, our objectives for using them and other information, see Note 12. Use of Estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and costs. These estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current events, historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may be different from these estimates and assumptions. Goodwill.
We do not amortize goodwill, but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment (a component) if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics.
Each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. With respect to the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit’s Fiscal 2022 impairment test, we determined that AmeriGas Propane’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately
30 %. While the Company believes that its judgments used in the quantitative assessment of AmeriGas Propane’s fair value are reasonable based upon currently available facts and circumstances, if AmeriGas Propane were not able to achieve its anticipated results and/or if its weighted average cost of capital were to increase, its fair value would be adversely affected, which may result in an impairment. There were no changes in facts and circumstances that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit may not be in excess of its book value at December 31, 2022.
There is approximately $ 2  billion of goodwill in this reporting unit as of December 31, 2022. The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units and related goodwill for any possible future non-cash impairment charges. Note 3 — Accounting Changes New Accounting Standard Adopted in Fiscal 2023 Debt and Derivatives and Hedging.
Effective October 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).” The amendments in this ASU affect entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts indexed to and potentially settled in an entity’s own equity. This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, expands disclosure requirements for convertible instruments, and simplifies the related earnings per share guidance. We adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective transition method and applied the new guidance to applicable features of our Equity Units.
Periods prior to October 1, 2022 have not been restated.
Upon adoption, we reclassified $ 6
from Common Stock to Preferred Stock associated with the previously separated equity-classified beneficial conversion feature, which was accounted for as a deemed dividend. The increase to Preferred Stock was partially offset by an increase of $ 1
to opening retained earnings for the previously recognized non-cash amortization of the beneficial conversion feature. The new guidance also removes the presumption of cash settlement for contracts that may be settled in cash or shares. In accordance with the new guidance, we included the dilutive impact of the quarterly contract adjustment payment liability associated with the 2024 Purchase Contracts, which may be settled in cash or shares, in our computation of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. The adoption of the new guidance did not, and is not expected to, have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 12 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Note 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers or cash receipts.
Contract assets represent our right to consideration after the performance obligations have been satisfied when such right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time.
Contract assets were not material for all periods presented.
Substantially all of our receivables are unconditional rights to consideration and are included in “Accounts receivable” and, in the case of Utilities, “Accrued utility revenues” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Amounts billed are generally due within the following month.
Contract liabilities arise when payment from a customer is received before the performance obligations have been satisfied and represent the Company’s obligations to transfer goods or services to a customer for which we have received consideration.
The balances of contract liabilities were $ 143 , $ 164
and $ 129
at December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other noncurrent liabilities” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Revenues recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, from the amounts included in contract liabilities at September 30, 2022 and 2021, were $ 81
and $ 70 , respectively.
14 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Remaining Performance Obligations The Company excludes disclosures related to the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to certain performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period because these contracts have an initial expected term of one year or less, or we have a right to bill the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of services provided to the customer to date.
Certain contracts with customers at Midstream & Marketing and Utilities contain minimum future performance obligations through 2047 and 2053, respectively.
At December 31, 2022, Midstream & Marketing and Utilities expect to record approximately $ 2.3  billion and $ 0.2  billion of revenues, respectively, related to the minimum future performance obligations over the remaining terms of the related contracts.
Note 5 — UGI International Energy Marketing Businesses Sale of U.K. Energy Marketing Business.
On October 21, 2022, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold its natural gas marketing business located in the U.K. for a net cash payment of $ 19
which includes certain working capital adjustments. In conjunction with the sale, during the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $ 215
($ 151
after-tax) substantially all of which loss was due to the non-cash transfer of commodity derivative instruments associated with the business. At the date of closing of the sale, these commodity derivative instruments had a net carrying value of $ 206
which is attributable to net unrealized gains on such instruments. At September 30, 2022, these derivative instruments were classified as held for sale assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and a net carrying value of $ 276 . The change in the carrying value of these derivative instruments between September 30, 2022 and October 21, 2022 resulted from changes in their fair values during that period. Other UGI International Energy Marketing Businesses.
In November 2022, the Company announced that it expected to sign a definitive agreement during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 to sell its energy marketing business in France. In December 2022, the Company announced that it no longer expected to sign a definitive agreement during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 as extended negotiations with the potential buyer had been discontinued. The Company continues to pursue the sale of its energy marketing business in France, as well as the wind-down of its energy marketing business located in Belgium and the Netherlands.
At December 31, 2022, the sale of our energy marketing business in France was not considered probable of occurring within one year and, as such, assets and liabilities associated with this business were not classified as held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $ 19
pre-tax ($ 15
after-tax) impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of certain assets associated with its energy marketing business in the Netherlands, comprising property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The impairment charge is reflected in “Operating and administrative expenses” on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and included in the UGI International segment. Note 6 — Inventories

For a description of the Company’s regulatory assets and liabilities, other than those described below, see Note 9 in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report. Other than removal costs, Utilities currently does not recover a rate of return on its regulatory assets listed below.
The following regulatory assets and liabilities associated with Utilities are included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Regulatory assets (a): Income taxes recoverable $ 93   $ 83   $ 145   Underfunded pension plans 114   114   106   Environmental costs 36   37   57   Deferred fuel and power costs 71   32   29   Removal costs, net 25   22   23   Other 54   52   52   Total regulatory assets $ 393   $ 340   $ 412   Regulatory liabilities (a): Postretirement benefit overcollections $ 11   $ 11   $ 13   Deferred fuel and power refunds 3   3   1   State tax benefits — distribution system repairs 39   38   33   Excess federal deferred income taxes 264   279   285   Other 3   4   14   Total regulatory liabilities $ 320   $ 335   $ 346   (a) Current regulatory assets are included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and regulatory liabilities are included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other noncurrent liabilities” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred fuel and power - costs and refunds.
Utilities’ tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred purchased gas and power costs through the application of PGC rates, PGA rates and DS tariffs. These clauses provide for periodic adjustments to PGC, PGA and DS rates for differences between the total amount of purchased gas and electric generation supply costs collected from customers and recoverable costs incurred. Net undercollected costs are classified as a regulatory asset and net overcollections are classified as a regulatory liability. The WVPSC, in an effort to mitigate the impact of WV Gas Utility’s new PGA rate increase to customers, delayed the effective date in 2022 from November 1 to December 1 and deferred $ 12
in under-recovery of gas cost in determining the rates to be charged to the various customer classes effective December 1, 2022. Additionally, to lower winter bills for residential customers, the WVPSC removed transportation and storage costs from the volumetric rate and created a fixed monthly pipeline demand charge applicable to only residential customers. PA Gas Utility uses derivative instruments to reduce volatility in the cost of gas it purchases for retail core-market customers. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on natural gas derivative instruments are included in deferred fuel and power costs or refunds. Net unrealized (losses) gains on such contracts at December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $( 17 ), $ 5
and $ 2 , respectively. Other Regulatory Matters UGI Utilities.  On January 27, 2023, Electric Utility filed a rate request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $ 11 . The increased revenues would fund ongoing system improvements and operations necessary to maintain safe and reliable electric service.
Electric Utility requested that the new electric rates become effective March 28, 2023. However, the PAPUC typically suspends the effective date for general base rate proceedings for a period not to exceed nine months after the filing date to allow for the investigation and public hearing. The Company cannot predict the timing or the ultimate outcome of the rate case review process. 16 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) On January 28, 2022, PA Gas Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its base operating revenues for residential, commercial and industrial customers by $ 83
annually. On September 15, 2022, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement providing for a $ 49
annual base distribution rate increase for PA Gas Utility, through a phased approach, with $ 38
beginning October 29, 2022 and an additional $ 11
beginning October 1, 2023. In accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility will not be permitted to file a rate case prior to January 1, 2024. Also in accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a weather normalization adjustment rider as a
5 -year pilot program beginning on November 1, 2022. Under this rider, when weather deviates from normal by more than
3 %, residential and small commercial customer billings for distribution services are adjusted monthly for weather related impacts exceeding the
3 % threshold. Additionally, under the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a DSIC once its total property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation reached $ 3,368
(which threshold was achieved in September 2022). On February 8, 2021, Electric Utility filed a rate request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $ 9 . On October 28, 2021, the PAPUC issued a final Order approving a settlement that permitted Electric Utility, effective November 9, 2021, to increase its base distribution revenues by $ 6 . Mountaineer.
On July 29, 2022, Mountaineer submitted its 2022 IREP filing to the WVPSC requesting recovery of costs associated with capital investments totaling $ 354
over the 2023 - 2027 period, including $ 64
in calendar year 2023. On November 16, 2022, Mountaineer and the intervening parties submitted a Joint Stipulation and Agreement for Settlement to the WVPSC requesting approval of 2023 IREP revenue of $ 22
to be charged effective January 1, 2023, which includes the recovery of a $ 1
under-recovery of 2021 IREP revenue. On December 21, 2022, the WVPSC issued an order approving the Joint Stipulation and Agreement for Settlement as filed.
Note 8 — Debt UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement.
In October 2018, UGI International entered into a
five-year
unsecured senior facilities agreement with a consortium of banks (the “UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement”), consisting of (1) a € 300
variable-rate term loan facility and (2) a € 300
multicurrency revolving credit facility. The UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement is scheduled to mature in October 2023. At December 31, 2022, the € 300
($ 321 ) variable-rate term loan is reflected in “Current maturities of long-term debt” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. UGI Utilities Credit Agreement.
On December 13, 2022, UGI Utilities entered into an amendment to the UGI Utilities Credit Agreement, providing for borrowings up to $ 425
and to replace the use of LIBOR with SOFR. Borrowings under the amended UGI Utilities Credit Agreement can be used to finance the working capital needs of UGI Utilities and for general corporate purposes. The UGI Utilities Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire June 2024. Borrowings under the amended UGI Utilities Credit Agreement bear interest, subject to our election, at a floating rate of either (i) Term SOFR plus the applicable margin plus a credit spread adjustment of
0.10 % or (ii) the base rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin remains unchanged from the original credit agreement. Mountaineer Credit Agreement.
On October 20, 2022, Mountaineer entered into the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement, as
borrower, with a group of lenders. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement amends and restates a previous credit agreement and provides for borrowings up to $ 150 , including a $ 20
sublimit for letters of credit. Mountaineer may request an increase in the amount of loan commitments to a maximum aggregate amount of $ 250 , subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement can be used to finance the working capital needs of Mountaineer and for general corporate purposes. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2024, with an option to extend the maturity date. Borrowings under the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement bear interest, subject to our election, at either (i) the base rate, defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus
0.50 % and (c) the adjusted term SOFR rate for a one-month tenor plus
1 %, in each case, plus the applicable margin or (ii) the adjusted term SOFR rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from
0 % to
1.25 %, and for SOFR loans from
1.00 % to
2.25 %, depending on the debt rating of Mountaineer. The adjusted term SOFR rate is defined as the term SOFR reference rate for the selected interest period, plus
0.10 % per annum for a one-month interest period,
0.15 % per annum for a three-month interest period, or
0.25 % per annum for a six-month interest period. 17 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies
Environmental Matters UGI Utilities From the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, UGI Utilities and its former subsidiaries owned and operated a number of MGPs prior to the general availability of natural gas. Some constituents of coal tars and other residues of the manufactured gas process are today considered hazardous substances under the Superfund Law and may be present on the sites of former MGPs. Between 1882 and 1953, UGI Utilities owned the stock of subsidiary gas companies in Pennsylvania and elsewhere and also operated the businesses of some gas companies under agreement. By the early 1950s, UGI Utilities divested all of its utility operations other than certain gas and electric operations.
Beginning in 2006 and 2008, UGI Utilities also owned and operated
two
acquired subsidiaries, with similar histories of owning, and in some cases operating, MGPs in Pennsylvania.
UGI Utilities is subject to a COA with the PADEP to address the remediation of specified former MGP sites in Pennsylvania, which is scheduled to terminate at the end of 2031. In accordance with the COA, UGI Utilities is required to either obtain a certain number of points per calendar year based on defined eligible environmental investigatory and/or remedial activities at the MGPs, or make expenditures for such activities in an amount equal to an annual environmental minimum expenditure threshold.
The annual minimum expenditure threshold of the COA is $ 5 . The COA permits the transfer of the specified wells, with related costs counted towards the annual minimum expenditure. At December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our aggregate estimated accrued liabilities for environmental investigation and remediation costs related to the current COA and the predecessor agreements totaled $ 54 , $ 53
and $ 50 , respectively. We do not expect the costs for investigation and remediation of hazardous substances at Pennsylvania MGP sites to be material to UGI Utilities’ results of operations because UGI Utilities receives ratemaking recovery of actual environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with the sites covered by the COA. This ratemaking recognition reconciles the accumulated difference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites.
As such, UGI Utilities has recorded an associated regulatory asset for these costs because recovery of these costs from customers is probable (see Note 7). From time to time, UGI Utilities is notified of sites outside Pennsylvania on which private parties allege MGPs were formerly owned or operated by UGI Utilities or owned or operated by a former subsidiary. Such parties generally investigate the extent of environmental contamination or perform environmental remediation. Management believes that under applicable law, UGI Utilities should not be liable in those instances in which a former subsidiary owned or operated an MGP. There could be, however, significant future costs of an uncertain amount associated with environmental damage caused by MGPs outside Pennsylvania that UGI Utilities directly operated, or that were owned or operated by a former subsidiary of UGI Utilities if a court were to conclude that (1) the subsidiary’s separate corporate form should be disregarded, or (2) UGI Utilities should be considered to have been an operator because of its conduct with respect to its subsidiary’s MGP. Neither the undiscounted nor the accrued liability for environmental investigation and cleanup costs for UGI Utilities’ MGP sites outside Pennsylvania were material for all periods presented. AmeriGas Propane AmeriGas OLP Saranac Lake.
In 2008, the NYDEC notified AmeriGas OLP that the NYDEC had placed property purportedly owned by AmeriGas OLP in Saranac Lake, New York on the New York State Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites. A site characterization study performed by the NYDEC disclosed contamination related to a former MGP. AmeriGas OLP responded to the NYDEC in 2009 to dispute the contention it was a PRP as it did not operate the MGP and appeared to only own a portion of the site. In 2017, the NYDEC communicated to AmeriGas OLP that the NYDEC had previously issued
three
RODs related to remediation of the site totaling approximately $ 28
and requested additional information regarding AmeriGas OLP’s purported ownership. AmeriGas OLP renewed its challenge to designation as a PRP and identified potential defenses. The NYDEC subsequently identified a third party PRP with respect to the site. 18 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) The NYDEC commenced implementation of the remediation plan in the spring of 2018. Based on our evaluation of the available information as of December 31, 2022, the Partnership has an undiscounted environmental remediation liability of $ 8
related to the site. Our share of the actual remediation costs could be significantly more or less than the accrued amount. Although we cannot predict the final results of these pending claims and legal actions, we believe, after consultation with counsel, that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial statements. In addition to the matters described above, there are other pending claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of our businesses. Although we cannot predict the final results of these pending claims and legal actions, we believe, after consultation with counsel, that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial statements. Note 10 — Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans for certain current and former employees. The service cost component of our pension and other postretirement plans, net of amounts capitalized, is reflected in “Operating and administrative expenses” on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-service cost components, net of amounts capitalized by Utilities as a regulatory asset, are reflected in “Other non-operating (expense) income, net” on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Other postretirement benefit cost was not material for all periods presented.
Net periodic pension cost includes the following components: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Service cost $ 2   $ 4   Interest cost 9   6   Expected return on plan assets ( 11 ) ( 12 ) Amortization of: Actuarial (gain) loss ( 1 ) 2   Net benefit $ ( 1 ) $ —   19 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Note 11 — Fair Value Measurements

to $ 27
given the available inputs considered.
The actual realized value at which these contracts will settle could vary significantly compared to the fair values reflected at September 30, 2022. The fair values of investments held in grantor trusts are derived from quoted market prices as substantially all of the investments in these trusts have active markets. Other Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of other financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities (except for current maturities of long-term debt) approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. We estimate the fair value of long-term debt by using current market rates and by discounting future cash flows using rates available for similar type debt (Level 2).
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt (including current maturities but excluding unamortized debt issuance costs) were as follows: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Carrying amount $ 6,759   $ 6,665   $ 6,580   Estimated fair value $ 6,350   $ 6,189   $ 7,048   Financial instruments other than derivative instruments, such as short-term investments and trade accounts receivable, could expose us to concentrations of credit risk.
We limit credit risk from short-term investments by investing only in investment-grade commercial paper, money market mutual funds, securities guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies and FDIC insured bank deposits.
The credit risk arising from concentrations of trade accounts receivable is limited because we have a large customer base that extends across many different U.S. markets and a number of foreign countries.
For information regarding concentrations of credit risk associated with our derivative instruments, see Note 12.
Note 12 — Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We are exposed to certain market risks related to our ongoing business operations. Management uses derivative financial and commodity instruments, among other things, to manage: (1) commodity price risk; (2) interest rate risk; and (3) foreign currency exchange rate risk. Although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
The use of derivative instruments is controlled by our risk management and credit policies, which govern, among other things, the derivative instruments we can use, counterparty credit limits and contract authorization limits. Although our commodity derivative instruments extend over a number of years, a significant portion of our commodity derivative instruments economically hedge commodity price risk during the next twelve months.
For information on the accounting for our derivative instruments, see Note 2. The following summarizes the types of derivative instruments used by the Company to manage certain market risks: Commodity Price Risk Regulated Utility Operations Natural Gas PA Gas Utility’s tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred costs of natural gas it sells to retail core-market customers, including the cost of financial instruments used to hedge purchased gas costs. As permitted and agreed to by the PAPUC pursuant to PA Gas Utility’s annual PGC filings, PA Gas Utility currently uses NYMEX natural gas futures and option contracts to reduce commodity price volatility associated with a portion of the natural gas it purchases for its retail core-market customers. See Note 7 for further information on the regulatory accounting treatment for these derivative instruments.
21 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Non-utility Operations LPG In order to manage market price risk associated with the Partnership’s fixed-price programs and to reduce the effects of short-term commodity price volatility, the Partnership uses over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments, principally price swap contracts. In addition, the Partnership and our UGI International operations also use over-the-counter price swap and option contracts to reduce commodity price volatility associated with a portion of their forecasted LPG purchases.
Natural Gas In order to manage market price risk relating to fixed-price sales contracts for physical natural gas, Midstream & Marketing enters into NYMEX and over-the-counter natural gas futures and over-the-counter and ICE natural gas basis swap contracts. In addition, Midstream & Marketing uses NYMEX and over-the-counter futures and options contracts to economically hedge price volatility associated with the gross margin derived from the purchase and anticipated later near-term sale of natural gas storage inventories. Outside of the financial market, Midstream & Marketing also uses ICE and over-the-counter forward physical contracts. UGI International also uses natural gas futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market price risk associated with a substantial portion of anticipated volumes under fixed-price sales contracts with its customers. Electricity In order to manage market price risk relating to fixed-price sales contracts for electricity, Midstream & Marketing enters into electricity futures and forward contracts. Midstream & Marketing also uses NYMEX and over-the-counter electricity futures contracts to economically hedge the price of a portion of its anticipated future sales of electricity from its electric generation facilities. UGI International also uses electricity futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market price risk associated with fixed-price sales and purchase contracts for electricity. Interest Rate Risk Certain of our long-term debt agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short-term market interest rates.
In order to fix the underlying short-term market interest rates, we may enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements and designate such swaps as cash flow hedges. The remainder of our long-term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest. As this long-term debt matures, we typically refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then-current market conditions. In order to reduce market rate risk on the underlying benchmark rate of interest associated with near- to medium-term forecasted issuances of fixed-rate debt, from time to time, we enter into IRPAs.
We account for IRPAs as cash flow hedges. There were
no
unsettled IRPAs during any of the periods presented. At December 31, 2022, the amount of pre-tax net gains associated with interest rate hedges expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months is $ 39 . Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts In order to reduce the volatility in net income associated with our foreign operations, principally as a result of changes in the USD exchange rate to the euro and British pound sterling, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. We layer in these foreign currency exchange contracts over a multi-year period to eventually equal approximately
90 % of anticipated UGI International foreign currency earnings before income taxes.
Because these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in “Other non-operating (expense) income, net,” on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 22 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Net Investment Hedges From time to time, we also enter into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the volatility of the USD value of a portion of our UGI International euro-denominated net investments, including anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends. We account for these foreign currency exchange contracts as net investment hedges and all changes in the fair value of these contracts are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component in AOCI. We use the spot rate method to measure ineffectiveness of our net investment hedges. Concurrent with the repayment of UGI International’s
3.25 % Senior Notes on December 7, 2021, we settled an associated net investment hedge having a notional value of € 93 . Additionally, in May 2022, we restructured certain net investment hedges associated with anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends. Cash flows from these settlements are included in cash flows from investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our euro-denominated long-term debt has also been designated as net investment hedges, representing a portion of our UGI International euro-denominated net investment. We recognized pre-tax (losses) gains associated with these net investment hedges in the cumulative translation adjustment component in AOCI of $( 64 ) and $ 13
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Quantitative Disclosures Related to Derivative Instruments The following table summarizes by derivative type the gross notional amounts related to open derivative contracts at December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the final settlement dates of the Company's open derivative contracts as of December 31, 2022, but excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception: Notional Amounts (in millions) Type Units Settlements Extending Through December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Commodity Price Risk: Regulated Utility Operations PA Gas Utility NYMEX natural gas futures and option contracts Dekatherms September 2023 15   19   14   Non-utility Operations LPG swaps Gallons September 2025 844   874   732   Natural gas futures, forward, basis swap, options and pipeline contracts (a) Dekatherms October 2027 371   363   382   Electricity forward and futures contracts Kilowatt hours December 2026 2,270   2,446   4,261   Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate swaps Euro N/A € —   € 300   € 300   Interest rate swaps USD June 2026 $ 1,354   $ 1,358   $ 1,418   Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk: Forward foreign currency exchange contracts USD August 2025 $ 390   $ 465   $ 415   Net investment hedge forward foreign exchange contracts Euro December 2026 € 331   € 411   € 486   (a) September 30, 2022 includes amounts held-for-sale associated with the October 2022 sale of the U.K. energy marketing business (see Note 5). 23 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Derivative Instrument Credit Risk We are exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our derivative instrument counterparties. Our derivative instrument counterparties principally comprise large energy companies and major U.S. and international financial institutions. We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties’ financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits or entering into netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain financial transactions, as deemed appropriate.
We have concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative instruments and we evaluate the creditworthiness of our derivative counterparties on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum amount of loss, based upon the gross fair values of the derivative instruments, we would incur if these counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts was $ 772 . In general, many of our over-the-counter derivative instruments and all exchange contracts call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the Company in the forms of letters of credit, parental guarantees or cash. At December 31, 2022, we had received cash collateral from derivative instrument counterparties totaling $ 108 . In addition, we may have offsetting derivative liabilities and certain accounts payable balances with certain of these counterparties, which further mitigates the previously mentioned maximum amount of losses. Certain of the Partnership’s derivative contracts have credit-risk-related contingent features that may require the posting of additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of the Partnership’s debt rating. At December 31, 2022, if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the amount of collateral required to be posted would not be material. Offsetting Derivative Assets and Liabilities Derivative assets and liabilities are presented net by counterparty on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets if the right of offset exists. We offset amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty. Our derivative instruments include both those that are executed on an exchange through brokers and centrally cleared and over-the-counter transactions. Exchange contracts utilize a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse to enter, execute or clear the transactions.
Over-the-counter contracts are bilateral contracts that are transacted directly with a third party.
Certain over-the-counter and exchange contracts contain contractual rights of offset through master netting arrangements, derivative clearing agreements and contract default provisions. In addition, the contracts are subject to conditional rights of offset through counterparty nonperformance, insolvency or other conditions. In general, many of our over-the-counter transactions and all exchange contracts are subject to collateral requirements. Types of collateral generally include cash or letters of credit. Cash collateral paid by us to our over-the-counter derivative counterparties, if any, is reflected in the table below to offset derivative liabilities. Cash collateral received by us from our over-the-counter derivative counterparties, if any, is reflected in the table below to offset derivative assets. Certain other accounts receivable and accounts payable balances recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with our derivative counterparties are not included in the table below but could reduce our net exposure to such counterparties because such balances are subject to master netting or similar arrangements. 24 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Fair Value of Derivative Instruments   The following table presents the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities by type, as well as the effects of offsetting: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Derivative assets: Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:     Foreign currency contracts $ 11   $ 57   $ 10   Interest rate contracts 63   66   5   74   123   15   Derivatives subject to PGC and DS mechanisms: Commodity contracts 18   31   10   Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:     Commodity contracts (a) 656   2,202   1,112   Foreign currency contracts 24   62   19   680   2,264   1,131   Total derivative assets — gross 772   2,418   1,156   Gross amounts offset in the balance sheet ( 239 ) ( 295 ) ( 116 ) Cash collateral received ( 108 ) ( 398 ) ( 205 ) Total derivative assets — net $ 425   $ 1,725   $ 835   Derivative liabilities: Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign currency contracts $ —   $ —   $ ( 3 ) Interest rate contracts —   —   ( 17 ) —   —   ( 20 ) Derivatives subject to PGC and DS mechanisms: Commodity contracts ( 35 ) ( 26 ) ( 7 ) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Commodity contracts (a) ( 414 ) ( 487 ) ( 171 ) Foreign currency contracts ( 4 ) ( 2 ) ( 4 ) ( 418 ) ( 489 ) ( 175 ) Total derivative liabilities — gross ( 453 ) ( 515 ) ( 202 ) Gross amounts offset in the balance sheet 239   295   116   Cash collateral pledged 45   7   —   Total derivative liabilities — net $ ( 169 ) $ ( 213 ) $ ( 86 ) (a) September 30, 2022 includes derivative assets and liabilities held-for-sale associated with the October 2022 sale of the U.K. energy marketing business (see Note 5). 25 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Effects of Derivative Instruments The following tables provide information on the effects of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and changes in AOCI: Three Months Ended December 31,: Gain (Loss) Recognized in AOCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Cash Flow Hedges: 2022 2021 2022 2021 Interest rate contracts $ 4   $ 12   $ 7   $ ( 6 ) Interest expense

These contracts include, among others, binding purchase orders, contracts that provide for the purchase and delivery, or sale, of energy products, and service contracts that require the counterparty to provide commodity storage, transportation or capacity service to meet our normal sales commitments. 26 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise) Note 13 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The tables below present changes in AOCI, net of tax: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Postretirement Benefit Plans Derivative Instruments Foreign Currency Total AOCI — September 30, 2022 $ 14   $ 37   $ ( 431 ) $ ( 380 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassification adjustments —   3   151   154   Amounts reclassified from AOCI —   ( 5 ) —   ( 5 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income attributable to UGI

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements Information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements use forward-looking words such as “believe,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,” or other similar words and terms of similar meaning, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words. These statements discuss plans, strategies, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. All forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q rely upon the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. A forward-looking statement may include a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying the forward-looking statement. We believe that we have chosen these assumptions or bases in good faith and that they are reasonable. However, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statement as these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary from assumed facts or bases, and the differences between actual results and assumed facts or bases can be material, depending on the circumstances. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind those factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report and in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report as well as the following important factors that could affect our future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements: (1) weather conditions, including increasingly uncertain weather patterns due to climate change, resulting in reduced demand, the seasonal nature of our business, and disruptions in our operations and supply chain; (2) cost volatility and availability of energy products, including propane and other LPG, electricity, and natural gas, as well as the availability of LPG cylinders, and the capacity to transport product to our customers; (3) changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including safety, health, tax, transportation, consumer protection, data privacy, accounting, and environmental matters, such as regulatory responses to climate change; (4) inability to timely recover costs through utility rate proceedings; (5) the impact of pending and future legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; (6) competitive pressures from the same and alternative energy sources; (7) failure to acquire new customers or retain current customers thereby reducing or limiting any increase in revenues; (8) liability for environmental claims; (9) increased customer conservation measures due to high energy prices and improvements in energy efficiency and technology resulting in reduced demand; (10) adverse labor relations and our ability to address existing or potential workforce shortages; (11) customer, counterparty, supplier, or vendor defaults; (12) liability for uninsured claims and for claims in excess of insurance coverage, including those for personal injury and property damage arising from explosions, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events that may result from operating hazards and risks incidental to generating and distributing electricity and transporting, storing and distributing natural gas and LPG in all forms; (13) transmission or distribution system service interruptions; (14) political, regulatory and economic conditions in the United States, Europe and other foreign countries, including uncertainties related to the war between Russia and Ukraine, the European energy crisis, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly the euro; (15) credit and capital market conditions, including reduced access to capital markets and interest rate fluctuations; (16) changes in commodity market prices resulting in significantly higher cash collateral requirements; (17) impacts of our indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; (18) reduced distributions from subsidiaries impacting the ability to pay dividends or service debt; (19) changes in Marcellus and Utica Shale gas production; (20) the availability, timing and success of our acquisitions, commercial initiatives and investments to grow our businesses; (21) our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and achieve anticipated synergies; (22) the interruption, disruption, failure, malfunction, or breach of our information technology systems, and those of our third-party vendors or service providers, including due to cyber attack; (23) the inability to complete pending or future energy infrastructure projects; (24) our ability to achieve the operational benefits and cost efficiencies expected from the completion of pending and future business transformation initiatives, including the impact of customer service disruptions resulting in potential customer loss due to the transformation activities; (25) our ability to attract, develop, retain and engage key employees; (26) uncertainties related to a global pandemic, including the duration and/or impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; (27) the impact of proposed or future tax legislation; (28) the impact of declines in the stock market or bond market, and a low interest rate environment, on our pension liability; (29) our ability to protect our intellectual property; and (30) our ability to overcome supply chain issues that may result in delays or shortages in, as well as increased costs of, equipment, materials or other resources that are critical to our business operations. These factors, and those factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report and those factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report, are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. We undertake no obligation (and expressly disclaim any obligation) to update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information or future events except as required by the federal securities laws. 30 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following analyses compare the Company’s results of operations for the 2022 three-month period with the 2021 three-month period.
Our analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the segment information included in Note 14 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Because most of our businesses sell or distribute energy products used in large part for heating purposes, our results are significantly influenced by temperatures in our service territories, particularly during the heating-season months of October through March.
As a result, our operating results, excluding the effects of gains and losses on derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions as further discussed below, are significantly higher in our first and second fiscal quarters. Non-GAAP Financial Measures UGI management uses “adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, when evaluating UGI’s overall performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to investors about UGI’s performance because they eliminate gains and losses on commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions and other significant discrete items that can affect the comparison of period-over-period results. UGI does not designate its commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments as hedges under GAAP. Volatility in net income (loss) attributable to UGI Corporation can occur as a result of gains and losses on such derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions.
These gains and losses result principally from recording changes in unrealized gains and losses on unsettled commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments and, to a much lesser extent, certain realized gains and losses on settled commodity derivative instruments that are not associated with current-period transactions. However, because these derivative instruments economically hedge anticipated future purchases or sales of energy commodities, or in the case of certain foreign currency derivatives, reduce volatility in anticipated future earnings associated with our foreign operations, we expect that such gains or losses will be largely offset by gains or losses on anticipated future energy commodity transactions or mitigate volatility in anticipated future earnings. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measures. 31 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES The following tables reflect the adjustments referred to above and reconcile net loss attributable to UGI Corporation, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation, and reconcile diluted loss per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted diluted earnings per share: Adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation Three Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 AmeriGas Propane $ 49  $ 34  UGI International 45  57  Midstream & Marketing 77  51  Utilities 81  63  Corporate & Other (a) (1,206) (302) Net loss attributable to UGI Corporation (954) (97) Net losses on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions (net of tax of

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Recent Developments European Energy Marketing Business.
Sale of U.K. Energy Marketing Business . On October 21, 2022, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold its natural gas marketing business located in the U.K. for a net cash payment of $19 million which includes certain working capital adjustments. In conjunction with the sale, during the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $215 million ($151 million after-tax) substantially all of which loss was due to the non-cash transfer of commodity derivative instruments associated with the business. At the date of closing of the sale, these commodity derivative instruments had a net carrying value of $206 million which is attributable to net unrealized gains on such instruments. At September 30, 2022, these derivative instruments had a net carrying value of $276 million.
The change in the carrying amount of these derivative instruments between September 30, 2022 and October 21, 2022 resulted from changes in their fair value during that period. Other UGI International Energy Marketing Businesses.
In November 2022, the Company announced that it expected to sign a definitive agreement during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 to sell its energy marketing business in France. In December 2022, the Company announced that it no longer expected to sign a definitive agreement during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 as extended negotiations with the potential buyer had been discontinued. The Company continues to pursue the sale of its energy marketing business in France, as well as the wind-down of its energy marketing business located in Belgium and the Netherlands.
At December 31, 2022, the sale of our energy marketing business in France was not considered probable of occurring within one year and, as such, assets and liabilities associated with this business was not classified as held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $19 million pre-tax ($15 million after-tax) impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of certain assets associated with its energy marketing business in the Netherlands, comprising property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
Global Macroeconomic Conditions.
Beginning in Fiscal 2021 and continuing into Fiscal 2023, global commodity and labor markets have experienced significant inflationary pressures attributable to various economic and political factors, including, among others: the economic recovery and evolving consumer patterns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; supply chain issues including those associated with labor shortages; significant increases and volatility in energy commodity prices; and political and regulatory conditions resulting from the war between Russia and Ukraine. These factors have contributed to inflationary pressures as evidenced by recent increases in various consumer price indices. In response to these inflationary pressures, central banks in the U.S. and Europe began increasing interest rates during Fiscal 2022. In addition, during the last several years, we have experienced significant volatility in energy commodity prices, particularly in LPG, natural gas and electricity prices, which have resulted in substantial fluctuations in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments. These inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations have resulted in increases in inventory and certain operating and distribution expenses across all of our businesses.
The commodity prices fluctuations have also significantly affected the cash collateral deposit requirements of our derivative instrument counterparties and the restricted cash required to be held in our derivative broker and clearing institution accounts. We cannot predict the duration or total magnitude of these conditions and the effects such conditions may have on our future business, financial results, financial position, and liquidity and cash flows. However, we continue to monitor and respond to these global economic and political conditions and remain focused on managing our financial condition and liquidity as these conditions continue to evolve. 33 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 2022 three-month period compared with 2021 three-month period Discussion.
Net loss attributable to UGI Corporation for the 2022 three-month period was $954 million (equal to $4.54 per diluted share) compared to net loss attributable to UGI Corporation of $97 million (equal to $0.46 loss per diluted share) during the 2021 three-month period. These results include net losses from changes in unrealized commodity derivative instruments and certain foreign currency derivative instruments of $1,028 million and $288 million during the 2022 and 2021 three-month periods, respectively. The higher losses from changes in commodity derivative instruments during the 2022 three-month period, principally reflects significant declines in commodity energy prices in Europe following unprecedented increases in such prices during Fiscal 2022.
Net loss attributable to UGI Corporation during the 2022 three-month period also includes (1) a $151 million loss on the sale of our energy marketing business in the U.K., principally reflecting the impact of the transfer of derivative hedge contracts; (2) an impairment of assets of $15 million; (3) external advisory fees of $5 million associated with AmeriGas operations enhancement for growth project; and (4) business transformation expenses of $1 million associated with Corporate support functions.
Net loss attributable to UGI Corporation during the 2021 three-month period also includes (1) an $8 million loss on extinguishment of debt at UGI International; (2) acquisition and integration expenses of $1 million associated with the Mountaineer Acquisition; and (3) business transformation expenses of $1 million.
Adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation for the 2022 three-month period was $246 million (equal to $1.14 per diluted share) compared to $201 million (equal to $0.93 per diluted share) during the 2021 three-month period. The increase in adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation during the 2022 three-month period reflects higher earnings contributions from our Midstream & Marketing, Utilities and AmeriGas Propane business segments partially offset by a lower earnings contribution from UGI International.
Temperatures in our domestic business segments during the 2022 three-month period were colder than the prior-year period while temperatures in our UGI International segment were significantly warmer than the prior-year period.
AmeriGas Propane’s adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation increased $15 million in the 2022 three-month period. This increase principally reflects higher average retail propane unit margin and slightly lower operating and administrative expenses primarily attributable to a workforce reduction made during Fiscal 2022 partially offset by higher distribution expenses. UGI International’s adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation decreased $12 million in the 2022 three-month period.
The lower net income reflects, in part, the weaker euro during the 2022 three-month period compared to the prior-year period.
Operating results reflect lower total margin principally due to the weaker currency and lower LPG volumes attributable to the warmer weather partially offset by the benefits of lower commodity prices and strong margin management.
The lower total margin was partially offset by lower operating and administrative expenses principally reflecting the translation effects of the weaker euro. Midstream & Marketing’s adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation increased $26 million in the 2022 three-month period on colder temperatures.
The increase in adjusted net income is primarily attributable to higher margins related to natural gas marketing activities and incremental contributions from UGI Moraine East and Pennant. Utilities’ adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation increased $18 million in the 2022 three-month period.
The increase was largely related to the weather that was colder than the prior-year period, growth in the core market customers and the impacts of the PA Gas Utility base rate increase which became effective in October 2022.
The increase in total margin was partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses. 34 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2022 Three-Month Period Compared with the 2021 Three-Month Period AmeriGas Propane For the three months ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Decrease) Increase (Dollars in millions)         Revenues $ 766  $ 778  $ (12) (2) % Total margin (a) $ 380  $ 360  $ 20  6  % Operating and administrative expenses $ 235  $ 240  $ (5) (2) % Operating income/earnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 110  $ 86  $ 24  28  % Retail gallons sold (millions) 236  241  (5) (2) % Heating degree days—% colder (warmer) than normal (b) 6.2  % (9.9) % —  —  (a) Total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales. (b) Deviation from average heating degree days is determined on a rolling 10-year period utilizing volume-weighted weather data based on weather statistics provided by NOAA for 344 regions in the U.S., excluding Alaska and Hawaii. Average temperatures during the 2022 three-month period were 6.2% colder than normal and 17.9% colder than the prior-year period. Notwithstanding the colder weather, total retail gallons sold decreased 2% during the 2022 three-month period due to staffing shortages in key delivery-related positions, which also limited growth, as well as continuation of customer attrition, along with structural conservation. Average daily wholesale propane commodity prices during the 2022 three-month period at Mont Belvieu, Texas, one of the major supply points in the U.S., were approximately 36% lower than such prices during the 2021 three-month period.
Total revenues decreased $12 million during the 2022 three-month period largely reflecting the lower retail propane revenues ($11 million) primarily on the lower volumes sold and lower wholesale revenues ($5 million) partially offset by higher revenues from ancillary sales and services
($5 million).
Total cost of sales decreased $32 million during the 2022 three-month period largely reflecting the lower average propane product costs ($36 million) and the lower retail propane volumes sold ($7 million) partially offset by the increase in wholesale volumes sold ($9 million). Total margin increased $20 million in the 2022 three-month period largely attributable to the higher average retail propane unit margins ($26 million) partially offset by the effects of the lower retail propane volumes sold ($6 million).
Operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes each increased $24 million during the 2022 three-month period primarily reflecting the previously mentioned increase in total margin and lower operating and administrative expenses ($5 million). The decrease in operating and administrative expenses reflects lower salaries and benefits expenses, including the carryover impact from the workforce reductions made during Fiscal 2022, partially offset by higher overtime and contractor costs associated with distribution activity and higher vehicle expenses. UGI International For the three months ended December 31, 2022 2021 Decrease (Dollars in millions)         Revenues $ 877  $ 1,049  $ (172) (16) % Total margin (a) $ 215  $ 256  $ (41) (16) % Operating and administrative expenses $ 143  $ 161  $ (18) (11) % Operating income

Average temperatures during the 2022 three-month period were 12.3% warmer than normal and 18.8% warmer than the prior-year period.
Total LPG retail gallons sold during the 2022 three-month period were 18% lower than the prior-year period largely attributable to reduced crop drying campaigns, significantly warmer weather and lower consumption, principally from residential customers, primarily resulting from conservation measures due in large part to high energy prices and war between Russia and Ukraine. UGI International base-currency results are translated into USD based upon exchange rates experienced during the reporting periods.
The functional currency of a significant portion of our UGI International results is the euro and, to a much lesser extent, the British pound sterling. During the 2022 and 2021 three-month periods, the average unweighted euro-to-USD translation rates were approximately $1.02 and $1.14, respectively, and the average unweighted British pound sterling-to-USD translation rates were approximately $1.17 and $1.35, respectively. Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant impact on the individual financial statement components discussed below. The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts entered into over multi-year periods to reduce the volatility in earnings that may result from such changes in foreign currency exchange rates in earnings.
These forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulted in realized net gains of $8 million and $4 million in the 2022 and 2021 three-month periods, respectively. UGI International revenues and cost of sales decreased $172 million and $131 million, respectively, during the 2022 three-month period compared to the prior-year period.
Average wholesale prices for propane and butane during the 2022 three-month period in northwest Europe were approximately 16% and 6% lower, respectively, compared with the prior-year period. The decrease in revenues and cost of sales principally reflects the lower retail volumes sold and the translation effects of the weaker foreign currencies (approximately $100 million and $73 million, respectively). UGI International total margin decreased $41 million during the 2022 three-month period primarily reflecting the effects of the lower retail volumes sold and the translation effects of the weaker foreign currencies (approximately $27 million). These factors were partially offset by higher average unit margins from our LPG business attributable to strong margin management efforts. Total margin from energy marketing activities were comparable to the prior-year period as higher total margin from natural gas marketing activities was offset by lower total margin from electricity marketing activities. UGI International operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes decreased $22 million and $16 million, respectively.
The decrease in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned $41 million decrease in total margin and lower gains associated with sales of assets ($10 million), partially offset by lower operating and administrative expenses ($18 million), higher foreign currency transaction gains ($7 million) and lower depreciation and amortization expenses ($3 million).
The lower operating and administrative expenses in the 2022 three-month period primarily reflects the translation effects of the weaker foreign currencies. The decrease in earnings before interest expense and income taxes in the 2022 three-month period largely reflects the $22 million decrease in operating income partially offset by higher realized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts entered into in order to reduce volatility in UGI International earnings resulting from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($4 million). Midstream & Marketing For the three months ended December 31, 2022 2021 Increase (Dollars in millions)         Revenues
$ 669  $ 535  $ 134  25  % Total margin (a) $ 155  $ 122  $ 33  27  % Operating and administrative expenses $ 29  $ 29  $ —  —  % Operating income $ 106  $ 74  $ 32  43  % Earnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 107  $ 82  $ 25  30  % (a) Total margin represents revenues less cost of sales. Average temperatures across Midstream & Marketing’s energy marketing territory during the 2022 three-month period were 1% warmer than normal and 13% colder than the prior-year period. Midstream & Marketing revenues increased $134 million compared to the prior-year period, principally reflecting increased revenues from natural gas and power marketing activities ($119 million), including the effects of peaking and capacity
36 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES management activities, that were impacted by higher natural gas prices.
The increase in revenues also includes higher natural gas gathering activities ($14 million), primarily due to the prior year acquisitions of UGI Moraine East and Pennant, and power generation, partially offset by reduced RNG credit sales. Midstream & Marketing cost of sales increased $101 million compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the higher natural gas costs related to the previously mentioned natural gas and power marketing activities ($97 million).
Midstream & Marketing total margin increased $33 million in the 2022 three-month period reflecting increased margins from natural gas marketing activities ($18 million), including the effects of peaking and capacity management activities from particularly cold weather at the end of December. The increase in total margin also includes incremental natural gas gathering activities ($14 million), primarily from the prior year acquisitions of UGI Moraine East and Pennant.
Midstream & Marketing operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes during the 2022 three-month period increased $32 million and $25 million, respectively, compared to the prior-year period. The increase in operating income is largely attributable to the previously mentioned increase in total margin.
The increase in earnings before interest expense and income taxes principally reflects the increase in operating income, partially offset by lower income from equity method investments following the acquisition of the remaining 53% ownership interest in Pennant during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022.
Utilities For the three months ended December 31, 2022 2021 Increase (Dollars in millions)         Revenues $ 592  $ 419  $ 173  41  % Total margin (a) $ 256  $ 213  $ 43  20  % Operating and administrative expenses (a) $ 91  $ 80  $ 11  14  % Operating income $ 126  $ 96  $ 30  31  % Earnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 128  $ 98  $ 30  31  % Gas Utility system throughput—bcf Core market 34  29  5  17  % Total 94  93  1  1  % Electric Utility distribution sales - gwh 246  242  4  2  % Gas Utility heating degree days—% colder (warmer) than normal (b) 0.2  % (15.1) % —  —  (a) Total margin represents revenues less cost of sales and revenue-related taxes (i.e., gross receipts and business and occupation taxes) of $7 million and $6 million, respectively, during the 2022 and 2021 three-month periods.
For financial statement purposes, revenue-related taxes are included in “Operating and administrative expenses” on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (but are excluded from operating and administrative expenses presented above). (b) Deviation from average heating degree days is determined on a 10-year period utilizing volume-weighted weather data based on weather statistics provided by NOAA for airports located within Gas Utility’s service territories. Temperatures in Gas Utility’s service territories during the 2022 three-month period were slightly colder than normal and 17.3% colder than the prior-year period. The increase in Gas Utility core market volumes (5 bcf or a 17% increase) during the 2022 three-month period is largely related to the weather that was colder than the prior-year period and growth in the core market customers.
Utilities revenues increased $173 million in the 2022 three-month period reflecting a $163 million increase in Gas Utility revenues and a $10 million increase in Electric Utility revenues.
The increase in Gas Utility revenues was largely driven by higher PGC rates reflecting higher natural gas costs, higher core market volumes, higher pricing on off-system sales, and the effects of the increase in base rates for PA Gas Utility that went into effect in October 2022.
The increase in Electric Utility revenues was largely driven by higher DS rates reflecting higher power costs.
Utilities cost of sales (including revenue-related taxes) increased $130 million in the 2022 three-month period primarily attributable to Gas Utility ($122 million) mainly reflecting higher PGC rates and, to a much lesser extent, increased cost of sales associated with off-system sales.
Electric Utility cost of sales increased $8 million during the 2022 three-month period largely reflecting the higher DS rates.
37 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Utilities total margin increased $43 million during the 2022 three-month period primarily attributable to higher Gas Utility total margin ($41 million) mainly reflecting weather that was colder than the prior-year period and the effects of the increase in base rates for PA Gas Utility that went into effect in October 2022.
Electric Utility margin was relatively flat compared to the prior-year period.
Utilities operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes each increased $30 million during the 2022 three-month period.
These increases largely reflect the previously mentioned increase in total margin partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses ($11 million) and higher depreciation expense ($2 million).
The higher operating and administrative expenses reflect, among other things, higher uncollectible accounts expenses, taxes other than income taxes and salary expenses.
The higher depreciation expense compared to the prior-year period reflects the effects of continued distribution system capital expenditure activity.
Interest Expense and Income Taxes Our consolidated interest expense during the 2022 three-month period was $92 million compared to $81 million during the 2021 three-month period. The increase in interest expense principally reflects the effects of higher credit agreement interest rates and borrowings, and higher long-term debt outstanding primarily at UGI Utilities. The decrease in the Company’s effective income tax rate for the 2022 three-month period principally reflects the effects on the estimated annual effective income tax rate from a greater concentration of pre-tax results in higher tax rate jurisdictions primarily resulting from the significant current-period losses on commodity derivative instruments at our UGI International segment, an expected increase in deferred tax valuation allowances, and the availability of investment tax credits in Fiscal 2023 following enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act.
The Company continues to evaluate the elections available under current regulations and pending legislation.
Accordingly, the impacts on the Company’s income tax provisions and taxes payable or refundable related to these items are subject to change. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY The Company expects to have sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand and available borrowing capacity, to continue to support long-term commitments and ongoing operations despite uncertainties associated with ongoing global macroeconomic conditions including, among others, changes in consumer behavior resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the inflationary cost environment and ongoing energy commodity price volatility. Our total available liquidity balance, comprising cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facilities, totaled approximately $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Our total available liquidity at December 31, 2022 was affected, in part, by the impact of cash collateral payments associated with a significant decline in commodity prices during the 2022 three-month period and increases in restricted cash margin requirements in commodity futures brokerage accounts, principally at UGI International. The Company does not have any scheduled near-term maturities of long-term debt, other than the UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement. The UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement, consists of (1) a €300 million variable-rate term loan facility and (2) a €300 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to mature in October 2023. At December 31, 2022, the €300 million ($321 million) variable-rate term loan is reflected in “Current maturities of long-term debt” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company expects to refinance the UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement during the first half of Fiscal 2023. In the absence of a refinance, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations as they become due over the next twelve months. The Company cannot predict the duration or total magnitude of the uncertain economic factors mentioned above and the total effects they will have on its liquidity, debt covenants, financial condition or the timing of capital expenditures. UGI and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2022. We depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide funds for working capital and to fund capital requirements. Our short-term cash requirements not met by cash from operations are generally satisfied with borrowings under credit facilities and, in the case of Midstream & Marketing, also from a Receivables Facility. Long-term cash requirements are generally met through the issuance of long-term debt or equity securities. We believe that each of our business units has sufficient liquidity in the forms of cash and cash equivalents on hand; cash expected to be generated from operations; credit facility and Receivables Facility borrowing capacity; and the ability to obtain long-term financing to meet anticipated contractual and projected cash commitments.
Issuances of debt and equity securities in the capital markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms. 38 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES The primary sources of UGI’s cash and cash equivalents are the dividends and other cash payments made to UGI or its corporate subsidiaries by its principal business units.
Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $317 million at December 31, 2022, compared with $405 million at September 30, 2022. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents since September 30, 2022 is primarily attributable to commodity price volatility experienced in the 2022 three-month period and the seasonality of our business as further described in “Cash Flows” below. Excluding cash and cash equivalents that reside at UGI’s operating subsidiaries, at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, UGI had $120 million and $140 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively.

Energy Services has a Receivables Facility with an issuer of receivables-backed commercial paper currently scheduled to expire in October 2023. The Receivables Facility provides Energy Services with the ability to borrow up to $150 million of eligible receivables during the period October 21, 2022 to April 30, 2023, and up to $75 million of eligible receivables during the period May 1, 2023 to October 20, 2023. Energy Services uses the Receivables Facility to fund working capital, margin calls under commodity futures contracts, capital expenditures, dividends and for general corporate purposes.
Under the Receivables Facility, Energy Services transfers, on an ongoing basis and without recourse, its trade accounts receivable to its wholly owned, special purpose subsidiary, ESFC, which is consolidated for financial statement purposes. ESFC, in turn, has sold and, subject to certain conditions, may from time to time sell, an undivided interest in some or all of the receivables to a major bank. Amounts sold to the bank are reflected as “Short-term borrowings” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. ESFC was created and has been structured to isolate its assets from creditors of Energy Services and its affiliates, including UGI. Trade receivables sold to the bank remain on the Company’s balance sheet and the Company reflects a liability equal to the amount advanced by the bank.
The Company records interest expense on amounts owed to the bank. Energy Services continues to service, administer and collect trade receivables on behalf of the bank, as applicable.
40 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES At December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of ESFC trade receivables was $128 million, $121 million of which were sold to the bank.
At December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of ESFC trade receivables was $115 million, none of which were sold to the bank. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, peak sales of receivables and average daily amounts sold were $121 million and $30 million, respectively. There were no sales of receivables under the Receivables Facility during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Significant Financing Activities
UGI Utilities Credit Agreement.
On December 13, 2022,
UGI Utilities entered into an amendment to the UGI Utilities Credit Agreement, providing for borrowings up to $425 million and to replace the use of LIBOR with SOFR. Borrowings under the amended UGI Utilities Credit Agreement can be used to finance the working capital needs of UGI Utilities and for general corporate purposes. The UGI Utilities Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire June 2024. Borrowings under the amended UGI Utilities Credit Agreement bear interest, subject to our election, at a floating rate of either (i) Term SOFR plus the applicable margin plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% or (ii) the base rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin remains unchanged from the original credit agreement. Mountaineer Credit Agreement.
On October 20, 2022, Mountaineer entered into the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement, as
borrower, with a group of lenders. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement amends and restates a previous credit agreement and provides for borrowings up to $150 million, including a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit. Mountaineer may request an increase in the amount of loan commitments to a maximum aggregate amount of $250 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement can be used to finance the working capital needs of Mountaineer and for general corporate purposes. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2024, with an option to extend the maturity date. Borrowings under the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement bear interest, subject to our election, at either (i) the base rate, defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the adjusted term SOFR rate for a one-month tenor plus 1%, in each case, plus the applicable margin or (ii) the adjusted term SOFR rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0% to 1.25%, and for SOFR loans from 1.00% to 2.25%, depending on the debt rating of Mountaineer. The adjusted term SOFR rate is defined as the term SOFR reference rate for the selected interest period, plus 0.10% per annum for a one-month interest period, 0.15% per annum for a three-month interest period, or 0.25% per annum for a six-month interest period. Dividends and Repurchases of Common Stock On November 17, 2022, UGI’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend equal to $0.36 per common share. The dividend was paid on January 1, 2023, to shareholders of record on December 15, 2022. On February 1, 2023, UGI’s Board of Director’s declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share. The dividend is payable April 1, 2023, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2023. On February 2, 2022, UGI’s Board of Directors authorized an extension of an existing share repurchase program for up to 8 million shares of UGI Common Stock for an additional four-year period, expiring in February 2026. Pursuant to such authorization, during the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased 0.3 million shares on the open market at a total purchase price of approximately $12 million. Cash Flows
Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s businesses, cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for natural gas, LPG, electricity and other energy products and services consumed during the peak heating season months. Conversely, operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the fourth and first fiscal quarters when the Company’s investment in working capital, principally inventories and accounts receivable, is generally greatest. Operating Activities.
Year-to-year variations in our cash flows from operating activities can be significantly affected by changes in operating working capital, especially during periods with significant changes in energy commodity prices. Cash flow used by operating activities was $240 million in the 2022 three-month period compared to $594 million in the 2021 three-month period. Cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was $491 million in the 2022 three-month period compared to $330 million in the 2021 three-month period. Cash used to fund changes in operating working capital totaled $731 million in the 2022 three-month period compared to $924 million in the 2021 three-month period. The
41 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES decrease in cash used to fund operating working capital changes in the 2022 three-month period principally reflects lower cash required to fund changes in accounts receivable and inventories reflecting in large part the effects of lower commodity prices and lower volumes in the current-year period. Partially offsetting these lower cash requirements were higher cash collateral payments associated with commodity derivative instruments principally reflecting repayments of collateral received in prior periods as a result of the changes in commodity prices. Investing Activities.
Investing activity cash flow is principally affected by cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment; cash paid for acquisitions of businesses and assets; investments in equity method investees; and cash proceeds from sales and retirements of property, plant and equipment. Cash flow used by investing activities was $271 million in the 2022 three-month period compared to $154 million in the 2021 three-month period. Cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $210 million in the 2022 three-month period compared with $186 million in the 2021 three-month period principally reflecting higher cash capital expenditures in our Utilities segment. Investments in equity method investments during the 2022 three-month period include our continuing investments in renewable energy projects. Cash inflows associated with investing activities during the 2021 three-month period includes cash received from the settlement of certain forward foreign currency contracts. Financing Activities.
Changes in cash flow from financing activities are primarily due to issuances and repayments of long-term debt; net short-term borrowings; dividends on UGI Common Stock; quarterly payments on outstanding Purchase Contracts; and issuances and repurchases of equity instruments. Cash flow provided by financing activities was $548 million in the 2022 three-month period compared to $234 million in the 2021 three-month period. The higher cash flow from financing activities in the 2022 three-month period is due to higher short-term borrowings of which a large portion of the proceeds were used to fund derivative commodity instrument collateral repayments and restricted cash margin requirements in commodity futures brokerage accounts. Cash flow from financing activities in the prior-year period includes the effects of the refinancing of senior notes at UGI International.
UTILITY REGULATORY MATTERS UGI Utilities.  On January 27, 2023, Electric Utility filed a rate request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $11 million. The increased revenues would fund ongoing system improvements and operations necessary to maintain safe and reliable electric service. Electric Utility requested that the new electric rates become effective March 28, 2023. However, the PAPUC typically suspends the effective date for general base rate proceedings for a period not to exceed nine months after the filing date to allow for the investigation and public hearing. The Company cannot predict the timing or the ultimate outcome of the rate case review process. On January 28, 2022, PA Gas Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its base operating revenues for residential, commercial and industrial customers by $83 million annually. On September 15, 2022, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement providing for a $49 million annual base distribution rate increase for PA Gas Utility, through a phased approach, with $38 million beginning October 29, 2022 and an additional $11 million beginning October 1, 2023. In accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility will not be permitted to file a rate case prior to January 1, 2024. Also in accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a weather normalization adjustment rider as a 5-year pilot program beginning on November 1, 2022. Under this rider, when weather deviates from normal by more than 3%, residential and small commercial customer billings for distribution services are adjusted monthly for weather related impacts exceeding the 3% threshold. Additionally, under the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a DSIC once its total property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation reached $3,368 million (which threshold was achieved in September 2022). On February 8, 2021, Electric Utility filed a rate request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $9 million. On October 28, 2021, the PAPUC issued a final Order approving a settlement that permitted Electric Utility, effective November 9, 2021, to increase its base distribution revenues by $6 million. Mountaineer.
On February 1, 2023, Mountaineer filed a Notice of Intent to File a General Rate Case with the WVPSC. On July 29, 2022, Mountaineer submitted its 2022 IREP filing to the WVPSC requesting recovery of costs associated with capital investments totaling $354 million over the 2023 - 2027 five-year period, including $64 million in calendar year 2023. On November 16, 2022, Mountaineer and the intervening parties submitted a Joint Stipulation and Agreement for Settlement to the WVPSC requesting approval of 2023 IREP revenue of $22 million to be charged effective January 1, 2023, which includes the recovery of a $1 million under-recovery of 2021 IREP revenue. On December 21, 2022, the WVPSC issued an order approving the Joint Stipulation and Agreement for Settlement as filed.
42 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposures are (1) commodity price risk; (2) interest rate risk; and (3) foreign currency exchange rate risk. Although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Commodity Price Risk The risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the Partnership and our UGI International operations pay for LPG is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for LPG and other energy commodities. Their profitability is sensitive to changes in LPG supply costs. Increases in supply costs are generally passed on to customers. The Partnership and UGI International may not, however, always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis, particularly when product costs rise rapidly. In order to reduce the volatility of LPG market price risk, the Partnership uses contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane, propane fixed-price supply agreements and over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts. Our UGI International operations use over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments and may from time to time enter into other derivative contracts, similar to those used by the Partnership, to reduce market risk associated with a portion of their LPG purchases. Over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments used to economically hedge forecasted purchases of LPG are generally settled at expiration of the contract.
Utilities’ tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred costs of natural gas it sells to its retail core-market customers, including the cost of financial instruments used to hedge purchased gas costs.
The recovery clauses provide for periodic adjustments for the difference between the total amounts actually billed to customers through PGC and PGA rates and the recoverable costs incurred.
Because of this ratemaking mechanism, there is limited commodity price risk associated with our Utilities operations. PA Gas Utility uses derivative financial instruments, including natural gas futures and option contracts traded on the NYMEX, to reduce volatility in the cost of gas it purchases for its retail core-market customers. The cost of these derivative financial instruments, net of any associated gains or losses, is included in PA Gas Utility's PGC recovery mechanism.
In order to manage market price risk relating to substantially all of Midstream & Marketing’s fixed-price sale contracts for physical natural gas and electricity, Midstream & Marketing enters into NYMEX, ICE and over-the-counter natural gas and electricity futures and option contracts, and natural gas basis swap contracts or enters into fixed-price supply arrangements. Midstream & Marketing also uses NYMEX and over-the-counter electricity futures contracts to economically hedge a portion of its anticipated sales of electricity from its electricity generation facilities. Although Midstream & Marketing’s fixed-price supply arrangements mitigate most risks associated with its fixed-price sales contracts, should any of the suppliers under these arrangements fail to perform, increases, if any, in the cost of replacement natural gas or electricity would adversely impact Midstream & Marketing’s results. In order to reduce this risk of supplier nonperformance, Midstream & Marketing has diversified its purchases across a number of suppliers. UGI International’s natural gas and electricity marketing businesses also use natural gas and electricity futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market risk associated with a substantial portion of anticipated volumes under fixed-price sales and purchase contracts. Midstream & Marketing has entered into fixed-price sales agreements for a portion of the electricity expected to be generated by its electric generation assets. In the event that these generation assets would not be able to produce all of the electricity needed to supply electricity under these agreements, Midstream & Marketing would be required to purchase electricity on the spot market or under contract with other electricity suppliers. Accordingly, increases in the cost of replacement power could negatively impact Midstream & Marketing’s results. Interest Rate Risk We have both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable-rate debt but generally do not impact their fair value. Conversely, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed-rate debt but do not impact their cash flows. Our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2022, includes revolving credit facility borrowings and variable-rate term loans at UGI International, Utilities, Energy Services and UGI Corporation. These debt agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short-term market interest rates. We have entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements on all or a significant portion of the term loans’ principal balances and all or a significant portion of the term loans’ tenor. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2022, combined borrowings outstanding under variable-rate debt agreements, excluding the previously mentioned effectively fixed-rate debt, totaled $1,774 million.
43 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Long-term debt associated with our domestic businesses is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt with similar terms and credit ratings. As these long-term debt issues mature, we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then-current market conditions. In order to reduce interest rate risk associated with near- to medium-term forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt, from time to time we enter into IRPAs. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our primary currency exchange rate risk is associated with the USD versus the euro and, to a lesser extent, the USD versus the British pound sterling. The USD value of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities will fluctuate with changes in the associated foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries, including anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends.
Gains or losses on these net investment hedges remain in AOCI until such foreign operations are sold or liquidated.
With respect to our net investments in our UGI International operations, a 10% decline in the value of the associated foreign currencies versus the USD would reduce their aggregate net book value at December 31, 2022, by approximately $105 million, which amount would be reflected in other comprehensive income. We have designated certain euro-denominated borrowings as net investment hedges. In order to reduce the volatility in net income associated with our foreign operations, principally as a result of changes in the USD exchange rate between the euro and British pound sterling, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. We layer in these foreign currency exchange contracts over a multi-year period to eventually equal approximately 90% of anticipated UGI International foreign currency earnings before income taxes. Derivative Instrument Credit Risk We are exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our derivative instrument counterparties. Our derivative instrument counterparties principally comprise large energy companies and major U.S. and international financial institutions. We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties’ financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits or entering into netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain financial transactions, as deemed appropriate.
We have concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative instruments and we evaluate the creditworthiness of our derivative counterparties on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum amount of loss, based upon the gross fair values of the derivative instruments, we would incur if these counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts was $772 million. In general, many of our over-the-counter derivative instruments and all exchange contracts call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the Company in the forms of letters of credit, parental guarantees or cash. At December 31, 2022, we had received cash collateral from derivative instrument counterparties totaling $108 million. In addition, we may have offsetting derivative liabilities and certain accounts payable balances with certain of these counterparties, which further mitigates the previously mentioned maximum amount of losses. Certain of the Partnership’s derivative contracts have credit-risk-related contingent features that may require the posting of additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of the Partnership’s debt rating. At December 31, 2022, if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the amount of collateral required to be posted would not be material. The following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instrument assets (liabilities) held at December 31, 2022 and changes in their fair values due to market risks. Certain of UGI Utilities’ commodity derivative instruments are excluded from the table below because any associated net gains or losses are refundable to or recoverable from customers in accordance with UGI Utilities ratemaking.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, were effective at the reasonable assurance level. (b) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.   45 Table of Contents UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The information set forth in Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report, is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS In addition to the information presented in this Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2022 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below and in our 2022 Annual Report are not the only risks facing the Company.
Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Our energy marketing business in Europe may continue to be dramatically disrupted by extreme prices and volatility in the natural gas and power markets in Europe, which have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a material negative impact on our financial results.
Our natural gas and power marketing businesses have traditionally relied upon stable price and availability conditions. The European energy markets have entered in an unprecedented state of volatility. In addition to the pre-existing natural gas supply shortages, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting substantial reduction of natural gas imports from Russia to Europe have led to significant volatility in the costs of both wholesale gas and power, and have created new risks that we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in Fiscal 2023 within our European energy marketing business. These risks include: (i) the ability to economically support the traditional fixed price and full requirement contracts of customers due to the significant increased cost to purchase incremental additional volumes consumed in excess of expectations; (ii) the ability to service typical portfolio needs with standard trading activities due to the limitations on purchasing cost effective services in the market; (iii) the ability to pass increased costs, including balancing costs, onto customers due, among other things, to timing, regulatory and contractual constraints, and (iv) the ability to maintain hedging services to customers due to the margining and liquidity constraints as well as maximum trading limits implemented by clearing banks on supplier counterparties. As a result, UGI is considering all scenarios with respect to the future of its energy marketing business in Europe, including exit and wind down. On October 25, 2022, UGI announced the sale of its energy marketing business in the United Kingdom and in November 2022, UGI announced its intent to sell its energy marketing business located in France, with a definitive agreement expected to be signed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, which did not occur. In December 2022, the Company announced that the negotiations with the potential buyer for the French energy marketing business had ceased and the exit of that business would be delayed. Further, in November 2022, the Company announced its intent to wind down its energy marketing businesses in Belgium and the Netherlands. The risks identified with respect to our energy marketing business in Europe have resulted in and may continue to have a material negative impact on our financial results. ITEM 2.
