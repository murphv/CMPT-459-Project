NioCorp Developments Ltd.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(expressed in thousands of
U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)
1. DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS
NioCorp
Developments Ltd. (“NioCorp” or the “Company”) was incorporated on February 27, 1987, under the laws of
the Province of British Columbia and currently operates in
one
reportable operating segment consisting of exploration and development
of mineral deposits in North America, specifically, the Elk Creek Niobium/Scandium/Titanium property (the “Elk Creek Project”)
located in southeastern Nebraska.
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis that contemplates the realization of assets and
discharge of liabilities at their carrying values in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. These financial
statements do not reflect any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
The
Company currently earns no operating revenues and will require additional capital in order to advance the Elk Creek Project to
construction and commercial operation. As further discussed in Note 4, these matters raised substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, and the Company is dependent upon the generation of profits from mineral properties, obtaining
additional financing and maintaining continued support from its shareholders and creditors.
2. BASIS
OF PREPARATION
a)
Basis of Preparation
and Consolidation
The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles of the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the consolidated
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries with all significant intercompany transactions eliminated. The accounting
policies followed in preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are those used by the Company as set
out in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022. Certain transactions include reference
to Canadian dollars (“C$”) where applicable.
In
the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary (including reclassifications and normal recurring adjustments)
for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at December 31, 2022, and for all periods
presented, have been included in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to appropriate SEC rules and regulations. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022. The interim results are not necessarily
indicative of results for the full year ending June 30, 2023, or future operating periods.
b)
Recent Accounting
Standards
Issued
and Adopted
In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in
Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments.
ASU 2020-06 removes certain accounting models which separate the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible
instruments. Either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition is permissible
for the adoption of this standard. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on July 1, 2022, with no material effect on the Company’
s current financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.

NioCorp Developments Ltd.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(expressed in thousands of
U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)
Issued
and Not Effective
From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective
date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards did not or will not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
c)
Use of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates
estimates and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuations, convertible debt valuations, and share-based compensation.
The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the other sources. The
actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent
there are material differences between estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
d)
Basic and Diluted
Earnings per Share
Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of the Company’s common shares, no par
value (“Common Shares”) outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net
loss by the weighted-average number of Common Share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock
method or the if-converted method, as applicable. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase Common Shares (“Options”)
and warrants to purchase Common Shares (“Warrants”) are considered to be Common Share equivalents and are only included
in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. The following shares underlying Options, Warrants,
and outstanding convertible debt were antidilutive due to a net loss in the periods presented and, therefore, were excluded
from the dilutive securities computation for the three- and six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as indicated below.

period end. Such amounts have  not  been adjusted for the treasury stock method or weighted average outstanding
calculations as required if the securities were dilutive.

3. RESTATEMENT
As
previously reported, the Company restated its consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. In addition, the restatement impacted
the first, second and third quarters of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The summarized restatement impacts for the comparable
interim period in fiscal year 2022 are presented below. The restatement corrects errors related to the accounting for
the unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discounts upon extinguishments of debt related to debt conversions.

4. GOING
CONCERN ISSUES
The
Company incurred a loss of $ 4,762
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 (2021 - $ 6,080 ) and had a working capital deficit
of $ 6,552
and an accumulated deficit of $ 115,159
as of December 31, 2022. As a development stage issuer, the Company has not yet
commenced its mining operations and accordingly does not generate any revenue. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of
$ 424
which is not sufficient to fund normal operations for the next twelve months without deferring payment on certain liabilities
or raising
9
NioCorp Developments Ltd.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(expressed in thousands of
U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)
additional funds. In addition, the Company will be required to raise additional funds for construction and commencement
of operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The
Company’s ability to continue operations and fund its expenditures, which have averaged approximately $ 1,400
per quarter
over the preceding three-year period, is dependent on management’s ability to secure additional financing. Management is
actively pursuing additional sources of financing, and while it has been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance
it will be able to do so in the future. Other than the proposed business combination and potential financing packages discussed
in Notes 14 and 15, the Company did not have any further funding commitments or arrangements for additional financing as of December
31, 2022. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments required to realize the Company’s
assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected
in the accompanying financial statements.
Since
March 2020, several measures have been implemented in the United States, Canada, and the rest of the world in response to the
increased impact from the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and subsequent COVID-19 variants. In addition, recent
worldwide events have created general global economic uncertainty as well as uncertainty in capital markets, supply chain disruptions,
increased interest rates, and the potential for geographic recessions. We believe this could have an adverse impact on our ability
to obtain financing, development plans, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows during the current fiscal year.
The full extent to which these events and our precautionary measures may continue to impact our business will depend on future
developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
5. LAND
AND BUILDINGS, NET
In
October 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the State of Nebraska (the “State”) to sell a strip of Company-owned
land totaling
approximately 1.27 acres located adjacent to State Highway 50
in connection with highway improvements to be completed
by the State, for $ 21 , inclusive of estimated fence replacement costs. The Company recorded a gain of $ 13
associated with this
sale.
6. DEFERRED
TRANSACTION COSTS
The
Company has deferred third-party costs, including legal fees, other professional and consulting fees, and due diligence fees,
incurred in connection with the proposed transaction discussed in Note 14. These costs are deferred until closing, at which time
a portion of the directly attributable costs will be recorded against convertible debt to be entered into in connection with the
proposed transaction, with the remainder treated as a reduction to the value of Common Shares issued.

DEBT
Changes
in the convertible security (the “Lind III Convertible Security”) issued to Lind Global Asset Management III, LLC
(“Lind”), are as follows:

Accretion expense

Conversions
( 1,950 )
Balance, December 31, 2022
$ 502
Based
on the Company’s closing Common Share price of C$ 1.00
as of December 31, 2022, conversion of the remaining
Lind III Convertible Security undiscounted face value of $ 515
(including accrued interest) would require the
issuance of approximately
816,000
Common Shares. For each C$ 0.01
change in the fair value of one Common Share,
the total Common Shares the
Company
would be obligated to issue would change by approximately 8,000 shares .

13. FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The
Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on U.S. GAAP guidance which defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
The
Company classifies financial assets and liabilities as held-for-trading, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables,
or other financial liabilities depending on their nature. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized at fair value
on their initial recognition.
Financial
assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading are measured at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in net income.
Financial assets classified as held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, and financial liabilities other than those classified
as held-for-trading are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method of amortization. Financial assets classified
as available-for-sale, including investments in equity securities, are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
being recognized in income.
Financial
instruments including receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and related party loans are carried at amortized
cost, which management believes approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The
following tables present information about the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as
of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company
utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical instruments. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable,
such as quoted prices, interest rates, and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points
for the financial instrument and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the instrument.

The
Lind III Convertible Security discussed in Note 8 was initially recorded at fair value, which represented a nonrecurring fair
value measurement using a Level 3 input. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of this instrument approximated
carrying value given that the instrument was issued in fiscal 2021 and has a short time period until maturity.
14. PROPOSED
TRANSACTION
On
September 25, 2022, the Company, GX Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware corporation (“GXII”), and Big Red Merger Sub
Ltd (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation incorporated in September 2022, and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”). Pursuant to the
Business Combination Agreement, as the result of a series of transactions, GXII will become a subsidiary of the Company (as successor
by merger to the Company’s subsidiary, Elk Creek Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“ECRC”)), with
the pre-combination public shareholders of GXII receiving Common Shares based on a fixed exchange ratio of 11.1829212 (the “Exchange
Ratio”) Common Shares for each GXII Class A common share held and not redeemed, and the GXII founders receiving shares in
GXII (as successor by merger to ECRC) based on the Exchange Ratio. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, after closing
of the Transaction (as defined below) (the “Transaction Closing”), the GXII founders will have the right to exchange
such shares for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis under certain conditions. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement,
the Company will also assume the obligations under the issued and outstanding GXII warrants, which will be converted into Warrants
following the Transaction Closing. The Business Combination Agreement contemplates that the Company will undertake a reverse stock
split of the Common Shares at the time of the Transaction Closing in connection with an expected cross-listing to the Nasdaq Stock
Market (“Nasdaq”). In addition, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, post-closing, the Company’s
Board of Directors will include two directors from pre-combination GXII. The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination
Agreement and the ancillary agreements thereto are referred to collectively as the “Transaction.”
As
currently structured, the Business Combination Agreement is expected to be accounted for as a recapitalization in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, GXII will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting
purposes. Accordingly, the transaction is treated as the equivalent of NioCorp issuing Common Shares for the net assets of GXII,
accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of GXII will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible
assets recorded.
The
proposed Transaction is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain
customary closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement, including, among other things, (i) obtaining required
approvals of the Transaction and related matters by the respective shareholders of NioCorp and GXII, (ii) the effectiveness of
the registration statement on Form S-4 that the Company originally filed on November 7, 2022, and amended on December 22, 2022,
January 17, 2023, January 31, 2023, and February 6, 2023, and was declared effective by the SEC on February 8, 2023, (iii) receipt
of approval for listing on Nasdaq of the Common Shares to be issued in connection
14
NioCorp Developments Ltd.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(expressed in thousands of
U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)
with the Transaction, (iv) receipt of approval for listing on Nasdaq of the Warrants to be issued in exchange for the
GXII warrants that NioCorp has agreed to assume, (v) receipt of approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) with
respect to the issuance and listing of the Common Shares issuable in connection with the Transaction, (vi) that NioCorp and its
subsidiaries (including GXII, as successor by merger to ECRC) will have at least $ 5.000001
million of net tangible assets upon
the consummation of the Transaction, after giving effect to any redemptions by GXII public stockholders and after payment of underwriters’
fees or commissions, (vii) that, at the Transaction Closing, NioCorp and its subsidiaries (including GXII, as successor by merger
to ECRC) will have received cash in an amount equal to or greater than $ 15.0
million, subject to certain adjustments, and (viii)
the absence of any injunctions enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Business Combination Agreement. The proposed additional
financings contemplated by the LOIs will also be subject to the approval of the TSX and the Company’s shareholders.
In
addition, in connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, the Company announced the signing of non-binding
letters of intent for two separate financing packages with Yorkville Advisors Global, LP. As discussed in Note 15, on January
26, 2023, the Company entered into definitive agreements with respect to these financings.
On
September 25, 2022, the Company and Lind entered into an agreement (the “Lind Consent”), which included the following
principal terms: (i) the consent of Lind to the Transaction and Yorkville financing transactions, including all actions taken
by NioCorp as set out in the Business Combination Agreement to permit the completion of the Transaction; (ii) the consent of Lind
to NioCorp’s expected Nasdaq listing and the consolidation of the Common Shares in order to meet the minimum listing requirements
thereof; (iii) the waiver of Lind of its participation right for up to
15 % of the total offering in the proposed standby equity
purchase agreement between NioCorp and Yorkville; and (iv) the waiver of Lind of certain restrictive covenants in the Lind III
Convertible Security.
As
consideration for entering into the Lind Consent, Lind received, amongst other things: (i) the right to receive payment of $ 500 ,
which will be reduced to $ 200
if the Transaction has not been consummated on or before April 30, 2023 (collectively, the “Consent
Payment”); (ii) an extension of its existing participation rights under the Lind III Convertible Security in future financings
of NioCorp for a further two year period, subject to certain exceptions as well as an extension of such participation rights beyond
the additional two year period if Yorkville or any affiliate is a party to any such applicable transaction; and (iii) the right
to receive additional Warrants (the “Consent Warrants”) if on the date that is eighteen months following consummation
of the Transaction, the closing trading price of the Common Shares on the TSX or such other stock exchange on which such shares
may then be listed, is less than C$ 1.00 , subject to adjustments. The number of Consent Warrants to be issued is based on the Canadian
dollar equivalent (based on the then current Canadian to US dollar exchange rate as reported by Bloomberg, LP) of $ 5.0
million
divided by the five-day VWAP of Common Shares on the date of issuance. Further, the number of Consent Warrants issued will be
proportionately adjusted based on the percentage of Warrants currently held by Lind that are exercised, if any, prior to the issuance
of any Consent Warrants.
The
final Consent Payment value and the issuance of Consent Warrants under the Lind Consent, if any, are subject to shareholders’
approval of the Transaction, an event which is outside of management control. Therefore, pending shareholders’ approval
of the Transaction, the Company has included the minimum $ 200
payment at December 31, 2022, as an accrued liability (see Note
7) with a corresponding increase in deferred transaction costs.
15. SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS
Yorkville
Financings
On
January 26, 2023, NioCorp entered into definitive agreements with respect to two previously announced financings with YA II PN,
Ltd., an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP (together with YA II PN, Ltd., “Yorkville”). The
financings contemplated by the definitive agreements include (i) up to $ 16.0
million
aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible
debentures of NioCorp (the “Convertible

(expressed in thousands of
U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)
Debentures”) convertible into Common Shares and Common Share purchase warrants
(the “Financing Warrants”) entitling the holders thereof to purchase additional Common Shares (the “Yorkville
Convertible Debt Financing”); and (ii) a standby equity purchase facility pursuant to which NioCorp will have the right,
but not the obligation, subject to the conditions set out therein, to sell Common Shares to Yorkville with a maximum aggregate
value of up to $ 65 .0 million over a period of up to
36
months (the “Yorkville Equity Facility Financing” and, together
with the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing, the “Yorkville Financings”).
The
Yorkville Financings are expected to become effective on the date of the Transaction Closing, as previously announced on September
26, 2022.
NioCorp
intends to use the proceeds from the Yorkville Financings to advance its efforts to launch construction of the Elk Creek Project
and move it to commercial operation, and to satisfy the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction, if required.
Completion
of the Yorkville Financings is subject to certain conditions, including the completion of the Transaction Closing, the receipt
of the approval of the TSX, and the approval of NioCorp’s shareholders in accordance with the rules of the TSX.
Yorkville
Convertible Debt Financing
On
January 26, 2023, NioCorp entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement”),
by and between NioCorp and Yorkville. Pursuant to the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement, Yorkville, and any investor
that exercises its contractual right previously granted by NioCorp to participate in the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing
(collectively with Yorkville, the “Investors”), will advance an initial total amount of $9.6 million to NioCorp in
consideration of the issuance by NioCorp to the Investors of $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures
at the time of the Transaction Closing (the “First Debenture Closing”), and an additional total amount of $5.76 million
to NioCorp in consideration of the issuance by NioCorp to the Investors of $6.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible
Debentures on a date to be determined at the election of NioCorp, but which may not be prior to the later to occur of (i) the
date of filing of the Convertible Debt Financing Registration Statement (as defined below) and (ii) the date of the Transaction
Closing (together with the First Debenture Closing, the “Debenture Closings”).
Each
Convertible Debenture issued under the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing will be an unsecured obligation of NioCorp, will have
an
18 -month term from the First Debenture Closing, which may be extended for one six-month period in certain circumstances at
the option of NioCorp, and will incur a simple interest rate obligation of
5.0 % per annum (which will increase to
15.0 % per annum
upon the occurrence of an event of default). The outstanding principal amount of, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, and
premium, if any, on the Convertible Debentures must be paid by NioCorp in cash when the same becomes due and payable under the
terms of the Convertible Debentures at their stated maturity, upon their redemption or otherwise.
Subject
to certain limitations contained within the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement and the Convertible Debentures, including
those as described below, holders of the Convertible Debentures will be entitled to convert the principal amount of, and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, on each Convertible Debenture, in whole or in part, from time to time over their term, into a number
of Common Shares equal to the quotient of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, being converted divided
by the Conversion Price. The “Conversion Price” means, as of any Conversion Date (as defined below) or other date
of determination, the greater of (i) 90% of the average of the daily U.S. dollar volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”)
of the Common Shares on the principal U.S. market for the Common Shares as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets during the
five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date on which the holder exercises its conversion right in accordance
with the requirements of the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement (the “Conversion Date”) or other date
of determination, unless NioCorp consents to conversion at a lower price, and (ii) the five-day VWAP of the Common Shares on the
TSX (or on the principal U.S. market if the majority of the trading volume and value of the Common Shares occurred on the Nasdaq
16
NioCorp Developments Ltd.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(expressed in thousands of
U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)
during the relevant period) for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Conversion Date or other date of determination
less the maximum applicable discount allowed by the TSX. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time it shall be a condition
to listing or continued listing of the Common Shares on the Nasdaq or such other principal U.S. market for the Common Shares that
the Conversion Price be not less than a minimum price (the “Floor Price”), then NioCorp and the holders will negotiate
in good faith to amend the Convertible Debentures to provide that the Conversion Price shall not be less than a Floor Price that
satisfies such condition. Any Floor Price will be subject to adjustment to give effect to any stock dividend, stock split or recapitalization.
The
terms of the Convertible Debentures restrict the number of Convertible Debentures that may be converted during each calendar month
by an Investor at a Conversion Price below a fixed price equal to the quotient of (i) ten dollars divided by (ii) 11.1829212 (being
the number of Common Shares that will be exchanged for each share of GXII at the Transaction Closing), subject to adjustment to
give effect to any stock dividend, stock split or recapitalization. The Convertible Debentures will be subject to customary anti-dilution
adjustments.
Pursuant
to the terms of the Convertible Debentures, following certain trigger events, and until a subsequent cure event, NioCorp will
be required to redeem $1.125 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures (the “Triggered Principal Amount”)
each month by making cash payments to the Investors, on a pro rata basis, in an amount equal to the Triggered Principal Amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, plus a redemption premium of 7% of the Triggered Principal Amount. Such monthly
prepayments under the terms of the Convertible Debentures are triggered (i) at the time when NioCorp has issued 95% of the total
amount of Common Shares pursuant to the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing that it may issue under applicable TSX and Nasdaq
rules or (ii) when NioCorp has delayed or suspended the effectiveness or use of the Convertible Debt Financing Registration Statement
for more than 20 consecutive calendar days, and such monthly prepayment obligations will continue until, with respect to (i) above,
shareholder approval is obtained or, with respect to (ii) above, the Investors may once again resell Common Shares under the Convertible
Debt Financing Registration Statement, respectively.
The
Convertible Debentures may also be redeemed at NioCorp’s option at any time and from time to time over their term at a redemption
price equal to
110 % of the principal amount being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The
Convertible Debentures contain events of default customary for instruments of their type (with customary grace periods, as applicable)
and provide that, upon the occurrence of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect
to NioCorp, all outstanding Convertible Debentures will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If
any other type of event of default occurs and is continuing, then any holder may declare all of its Convertible Debentures to
be due and payable immediately.
In
conjunction with each Debenture Closing, NioCorp will issue to the Investors Financing Warrants to purchase a number of Common
Shares as is equal to the quotient of the principal amount of Convertible Debentures issued in such Debenture Closing divided
by the “Exercise Price”, which is equal to the greater of: (a) the quotient of ten dollars divided by 11.1829212;
or (b) the average of the daily VWAPs of the Common Shares on the principal U.S. market for the Common Shares during regular trading
hours as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets during the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately
prior to such Debenture Closing, in each case subject to any adjustment to give effect to any stock dividend, stock split or recapitalization.
The
Financing Warrants will be exercisable, in whole or in part, but not in increments of less than $ 50
aggregate Exercise Price (unless
the remaining aggregate Exercise Price is less than $ 50 ), beginning on the earlier of (a) six months following the issuance of
the applicable Financing Warrants or (b) the effective date of the initial Convertible Debt Financing Registration Statement (the
“Exercise Date”) and may be exercised at any time prior to their expiration. Holders of the Financing Warrants may
exercise their Financing Warrants, at their election, by paying the Exercise Price in cash or on a cashless exercise basis. On
each of the first 12 monthly anniversaries of the Exercise Date, 1/12th of the Financing Warrants will expire.

NioCorp Developments Ltd.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(expressed in thousands of
U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)
The
Financing Warrants will have customary anti-dilution adjustments to be determined in accordance with the requirements of the applicable
stock exchanges, including the TSX.
The
terms of the Convertible Debentures and the Financing Warrants restrict the conversion of Convertible Debentures or exercise of
Financing Warrants by an Investor if such a conversion or exercise would cause the Investor to exceed certain beneficial ownership
thresholds in NioCorp or such a conversion or exercise would cause the aggregate number of Common Shares issued pursuant to the
Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing to exceed the thresholds for issuance of Common Shares under the rules of the TSX and Nasdaq,
unless prior shareholder approval is obtained.
The
Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, conditions and indemnification
obligations by each party. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing
Agreement were made only for purposes of the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely
for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain important limitations.
The
Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement also contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit NioCorp’s
ability to use the proceeds from the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing to repay related party debt or to enter into any variable
rate transaction other than with Yorkville, subject to certain exceptions.
The
Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement will terminate automatically if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated.
Also, the Investors will have the right to terminate the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement if the First Debenture
Closing does not occur on or prior to March 22, 2023. NioCorp will have the right to terminate the Yorkville Convertible Debt
Financing Agreement at any time prior to the First Debenture Closing, provided that it will be required to pay a cash termination
fee of $ 1.6
million to the Investors, on a pro rata basis.
On
January 26, 2023, in connection with the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement, NioCorp and Yorkville also entered into
a registration rights agreement (the “Convertible Debt Financing Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which
NioCorp has agreed to file with the SEC a registration statement (the “Convertible Debt Financing Registration Statement”)
registering the resale by the Investors of the Common Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and the
exercise of the Financing Warrants under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), as soon as practicable
but no later than 21 calendar days following the Transaction Closing, and to use its reasonable best efforts to have the Convertible
Debt Financing Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but in no event later
than the 45th calendar day following the filing date thereof. NioCorp further agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Convertible Debt Financing Registration Statement to remain continuously effective for a period that will terminate upon the
first date on which all of the Common Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and the exercise of the
Financing Warrants may be sold without restriction, including volume and manner-of-sale restrictions, pursuant to Rule 144 under
the Securities Act or have been sold by Investors. NioCorp also granted to the Investors certain demand rights for underwritten
shelf takedowns and piggyback registration rights with respect to the Common Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible
Debentures and the exercise of the Financing Warrants.
Yorkville
Equity Facility Financing
On
January 26, 2023, NioCorp entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement, (the “Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement”),
by and between NioCorp and Yorkville. Pursuant to the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, NioCorp will have the right,
but not the obligation, to sell Common Shares to Yorkville with a maximum aggregate value of up to $ 65.0
million
(the “Commitment
Amount”) for a period commencing at the Transaction Closing and ending on the earliest of (i) the first day of the month
next following the 36-month anniversary of the Transaction Closing, (ii) the date on which Yorkville shall have made payment of
the full Commitment Amount and (iii) the date that the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement otherwise terminates in accordance
with its terms (the “Commitment Period”), and will issue to Yorkville $ 0.65

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022
(expressed in thousands of
U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)
million aggregate principal amount of Common
Shares for no additional consideration. Additionally, NioCorp will pay to Yorkville an aggregate fee of $ 1.5
million
in cash (the
“Cash Fee”), including $0.5 million on the date of the Transaction Closing and the remainder in installments over
a 12-month period following the date of the Transaction Closing, provided that, NioCorp will have the right to prepay without
penalty all or part of the Cash Fee at any time. Each right to sell Common Shares under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing
Agreement is referred to as an “Advance.”
Subject
to certain limitations, including those as described below, and adjustments contained within the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing
Agreement, NioCorp will have the option to sell Common Shares to Yorkville at a purchase price equal to (a) 97% of the VWAP of
the Common Shares on the principal U.S. market for the Common Shares during the applicable pricing period, which is a period during
a single trading day defined based on when NioCorp submits written notice (an “Advance Notice”) to Yorkville exercising
its right to an Advance (“Purchase Price Option #1”); or (b) 97% of the average of the daily VWAPs of the Common Shares
on the principal U.S. market for the Common Shares during a pricing period of three consecutive trading days commencing on the
trading day an Advance Notice is received by Yorkville, if it is received by 9:30 a.m., New York City time, or the immediately
following trading day if it is received after 9:30 a.m., New York City time (“Purchase Price Option #2”). Purchase
Price Option # 2 will be used whenever any Convertible Debentures issued to Yorkville pursuant to the Yorkville Convertible Debt
Financing Agreement are outstanding, unless waived by Yorkville.
The
Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement limits the number of Common Shares that may be issued to Yorkville in each Advance
to the greater of
(a) 5,000,000 Common Shares and (b) the number of Common Shares equal to 100% of the average daily volume traded
of the Common Shares on the Nasdaq during the five trading days prior to an Advance , provided that, if any Convertible Debentures
are outstanding when an Advance Notice is delivered, then the maximum number of Common Shares that may be issued will be computed
in accordance with (b) only (the “Maximum Advance Amount”). Notwithstanding this, NioCorp and Yorkville may agree
to an issuance of a number of Common Shares in excess of the Maximum Advance Amount in any given Advance. Further, for as long
as the Convertible Debentures issued to Yorkville are outstanding, the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement provides
for certain limitations on the amount of Advances that NioCorp may request, including that NioCorp shall not effect more than
two Advances in any month. The Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement also restricts the sale of Common Shares to Yorkville
if such a sale would cause Yorkville to exceed certain beneficial ownership thresholds in NioCorp or such issuance would cause
the aggregate number of Common Shares issued pursuant to the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing to exceed the thresholds for
issuance of Common Shares under the rules of the TSX and Nasdaq, unless prior shareholder approval is obtained.
Subject
to certain other conditions, NioCorp may deliver an Advance Notice only after the completion of the preceding Advance and only
so long as the Equity Facility Financing Registration Statement (as defined below) is effective and Yorkville is permitted to
utilize the prospectus thereunder to resell all of the Common Shares issuable pursuant to such Advance Notice. Pursuant to the
Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, NioCorp must prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement registering
the resale in the United States of the Common Shares issuable pursuant to the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement (the
“Equity Facility Financing Registration Statement”). Pursuant to the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement,
NioCorp in its sole discretion may choose when to file the Equity Facility Financing Registration Statement. Once effective, NioCorp
has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Equity Facility Financing Registration
Statement at all times until the earliest to occur of (i) receipt of notice that Yorkville has completed resales of the full Commitment
Amount pursuant to the Equity Facility Financing Registration Statement, (ii) the 180th day following the latest closing of an
Advance that has occurred and (iii) the 180th day following the termination of the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement
in accordance with its terms.
The
Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, conditions and indemnification obligations
by each party. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement were
made only for purposes of the Yorkville Equity Facility

as of, and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). This discussion and analysis
contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual
results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements and information as a result of many factors,
including, but not limited to, those set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” below.
All currency amounts are stated in
thousands
of U.S. dollars
unless noted otherwise.
As used in this report, unless the context
otherwise indicates, references to “we,” “our,” the “Company,” “NioCorp,” and “us”
refer to NioCorp Developments Ltd. and its subsidiaries, collectively.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and
the exhibits attached hereto contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”), and “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities
legislation (collectively, “forward-looking statements”). Such forward-looking statements concern our anticipated results
and developments in the operations of the Company in future periods, planned exploration activities, the adequacy of the Company’s
financial resources, and other events or conditions that may occur in the future.
Forward-looking statements have been based
upon our current business and operating plans, as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, and may include statements
regarding our cash and other funding requirements and timing and sources thereof; results of feasibility studies; the accuracy
of mineral resource and reserve estimates and assumptions on which they are based; the results of economic assessments and exploration
activities; and current market conditions and project development plans, and the Transaction (as defined below). The material assumptions
used to develop the forward-looking statements and forward-looking information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include:
our expectations of mineral prices; our forecasts and expected cash flows; our projected capital and operating costs; accuracy
of mineral resource estimates and resource modeling and feasibility study results; expectations regarding mining and metallurgical
recoveries; timing and reliability of sampling and assay data; anticipated political and social conditions; expected national and
local government policies, including legal reforms; successful advancement of the Company’s required permitting processes;
and the ability to successfully raise additional capital; NioCorp and GX Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware corporation (“GXII”),
being able to receive all required regulatory, third-party and shareholder approvals for the proposed Transaction; the amount of
redemptions by GXII public stockholders; the consummation of the convertible debenture transaction and the standby equity purchase
facility contemplated by the definitive agreements with YA II PN, Ltd., an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global,
LP (together with YA II PN, Ltd., “Yorkville”); and other current estimates and assumptions regarding the proposed
Transaction and its benefits.
Forward-looking statements are frequently,
but not always, identified by words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,”
“estimates,” “potential,” “possible,” and similar expressions, or statements that events, conditions,
or results “will,” “may,” “could,” or “should” (or the negative and grammatical
variations of any of these terms) occur or be achieved. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions,
expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions, or future events or performance (often, but not always, using
words or phrases such as “expects” or “does not expect,” “is expected,” “anticipates”
or “does not anticipate,” “plans,” “estimates,” or “intends,” or stating that certain
actions, events, or results “may,” “could,” “would,” “might,” or “will”
be taken, occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain known and unknown
risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Many factors could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, performance, or

Company Overview
NioCorp is developing the Elk Creek Project,
located in southeast Nebraska. The Elk Creek Project is an advanced Niobium (“Nb”), Scandium (“Sc”) and
Titanium (“Ti”) development stage property. The Company is evaluating the potential to produce several Rare Earth byproducts
from the Elk Creek Project. Niobium is used to produce various superalloys that are extensively used in high performance aircraft
and jet turbines. It also is used in High-Strength, Low-Alloy (“HSLA”) steel, a stronger steel used in automobiles,
bridges, structural systems, buildings, pipelines, and other applications that generally increases strength and/or reduces weight,
which can result in environmental benefits, including reduced fuel consumption and material usage and fewer air emissions. Scandium
can be combined with aluminum to make high-performance alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion resistance. Scandium
also is a critical component of advanced solid oxide fuel cells, an environmentally preferred technology for high-reliability,
distributed electricity generation. Titanium is a component of various superalloys and other applications that are used for aerospace
applications, weapons systems, protective armor, medical implants, and many others. It also is used in pigments for paper, paint,
and plastics. Rare Earths are critical to electrification and decarbonization initiatives and can be used to manufacture the strongest
permanent magnets commercially available.
Our primary business strategy is to advance
our Elk Creek Project to commercial production. We are focused on obtaining additional funds to carry out our near-term planned
work programs associated with securing the project financing necessary to complete mine development and construction of the Elk
Creek Project.
Recent Corporate Events
Proposed Transaction
On September 25, 2022, the Company, GXII,
and Merger Sub, entered into the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, as the result
of a series of transactions, GXII will become a subsidiary of the Company (as successor by merger to the Company’s subsidiary,
ECRC), with the pre-combination public shareholders of GXII receiving Common Shares based on the Exchange Ratio of 11.1829212 Common
Shares for each GXII Class A common share held and not redeemed, and the GXII founders receiving shares in GXII (as successor by
merger to ECRC) based on the Exchange Ratio. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, after the Transaction Closing, the
GXII founders will have the right to exchange such shares for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis under certain conditions. Pursuant
to the Business Combination Agreement, the Company will also assume the obligations under the issued and outstanding GXII warrants,
which will be converted into Warrants following the Transaction Closing. The Business Combination Agreement contemplates that the
Company will undertake a reverse stock split of the Common Shares at the time of the Transaction Closing in connection with an
expected cross-listing to Nasdaq. In addition, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, post-closing, the Company’s
Board of Directors will include two directors from pre-combination GXII. The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination
Agreement and the ancillary agreements thereto are referred to collectively as the “Transaction.”
The business combination pursuant to the
Business Combination Agreement will be accounted for as a recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting,
GXII will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the transaction is treated
as the equivalent of NioCorp issuing Common Shares for the net assets of GXII, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets
of GXII will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.
The
proposed Transaction is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain
customary closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement, including, among other things, (i) obtaining required
approvals of the Transaction and related matters by the respective shareholders of NioCorp and GXII, (ii) the effectiveness of
the registration statement on Form S-4 that the Company originally filed on November 7, 2022, and amended on December 22, 2022,
January 17, 2023, January 31, 2023, and February 6, 2023, and was declared effective by the SEC on February 8, 2023, (iii) receipt
of approval for listing on Nasdaq of the Common Shares to be issued in connection with the Transaction, (iv) receipt of approval
for listing on Nasdaq of the Warrants to be issued in exchange for the GXII warrants that NioCorp has agreed to assume, (v) receipt
of approval from the TSX with respect to the issuance and listing of the Common Shares issuable in connection with the Transaction,
(vi) that NioCorp and its subsidiaries (including GXII, as successor by merger to ECRC) will have at least $5.000001 million of
net tangible assets upon the consummation of the Transaction, after giving effect to any redemptions by GXII public stockholders
and after payment of underwriters’ fees or commissions,
24
(vii)
that, at the Transaction Closing, NioCorp and its subsidiaries (including GXII, as successor by merger to ECRC) will have received
cash in an amount equal to or greater than $15.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, and (viii) the absence of any injunctions
enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Business Combination Agreement. The proposed additional financings contemplated
by the LOIs will also be subject to the approval of the TSX and the Company’s shareholders.
In addition, in connection with the entry
into the Business Combination Agreement, the Company announced the signing of non-binding letters of intent for two separate financing
packages with Yorkville. As discussed below, on January 26, 2023, the Company entered into definitive agreements with respect to
these financings.
Final proceeds will depend upon redemption
rates of current GXII shareholders at the consummation of the proposed Transaction. In connection with the Transaction Closing,
a significant number of GXII shareholders may exercise their redemption rights. See Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—If
the Transaction is consummated, the Combined Company may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits expected as a result
of the Transaction.”
Yorkville Financings
As
further discussed in Note 15 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of, and for the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022, included elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, on January 26, 2023, NioCorp entered
into definitive agreements with respect to two previously announced financings with Yorkville. The financings contemplated by
the definitive agreements include (i) up to $16.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible debentures of NioCorp
(the “Convertible Debentures”) convertible into Common Shares and Common Share purchase warrants (the “Financing
Warrants”) entitling the holders thereof to purchase additional Common Shares (the “Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing”);
and (ii) a standby equity purchase facility pursuant to which NioCorp will have the right, but not the obligation, subject to
the conditions set out therein, to sell Common Shares to Yorkville with a maximum aggregate value of up to $65.0 million over
a period of up to 36 months (the “Yorkville Equity Facility Financing” and, together with the Yorkville Convertible
Debt Financing, the “Yorkville Financings”).
The Yorkville Financings are expected to
become effective on the date of the Transaction Closing.
NioCorp intends to use the proceeds from
the Yorkville Financings to advance its efforts to launch construction of the Elk Creek Project and move it to commercial operation,
and to satisfy the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction, if required.
Completion of the Yorkville Financings
is subject to certain conditions, including the completion of the Transaction Closing, the receipt of the approval of the TSX,
and the approval of NioCorp’s shareholders in accordance with the rules of the TSX.
Elk Creek Project Update
On October 25,
2022, the Company announced that its demonstration-scale processing plant (the “demonstration plant”), operated in
Quebec, Canada, by L3 Process Innovation (“L3”), had completed demonstrating its planned process for removing calcium
and magnesium from ore obtained from the Elk Creek Project. This positive result is a key milestone in NioCorp’s proposed
optimization of its process flow sheet for the Elk Creek Project, which was designed by L3 and NioCorp.
Removing carbonate
minerals in this fashion is expected to reduce the size of the follow-on planned production steps and make them more efficient.
Characterization of the calcium and magnesium carbonate from the completed demonstration plant production runs has demonstrated
very low levels of impurities, and an overall 99% purity of the mixed calcium-magnesium carbonate.
On January 4,
2023, the Company announced that the demonstration plant has succeeded in obtaining a Rare Earth dissolution rate of 86-95% from
ore from the Elk Creek Project site through hydrochloric acid leaching and has achieved a loading rate of Rare Earths as high as
99% in the follow-on solvent extraction recovery step. These relatively high rates, which were expected, point to potentially strong
rates of overall recovery of separated Rare Earth oxides, subject to additional demonstration testing over the coming weeks.
25
Additional solvent
extraction steps will be deployed to establish the ultimate recovery rates of potential Rare Earth products. The demonstration
plant has further established that the Rare Earths recovered in the initial solvent extraction step are accompanied by only two
impurities of note: iron and a very small amount of nickel. Given the success of this initial separation step, L3 and NioCorp expect
that losses in the additional solvent extraction steps would be low.
On
February 6, 2023, the Company announced that overall recoveries for praseodymium oxide, neodymium oxide, terbium oxide, and
dysprosium oxide are likely to be greater than 92% and meet commercial purity specifications for magnetic rare earth oxides. These
results are in line with bench- and pilot-scale testing of L3’s rare earth recovery system, as well as hydrometallurgical
performance models that have been run on the rare earth recovery process upon which the demonstration plant is based.
NioCorp is currently
focused on demonstrating its ability to recover three high-purity Rare Earth products: (1) neodymium-praseodymium (“NdPr”)
oxide, which is the principal component of neodymium-iron-boron (“NdFeB”) permanent Rare Earth magnets, (2) Dy oxide,
and (3) Tb oxide. Both Dy and Tb oxides are critical to the type of powerful NdFeB magnets used in the traction motors of electric
vehicles. The Demonstration Plant is also expected to deliver updated metallurgical recoveries for niobium, scandium and titanium
and expects to complete operations in the first calendar quarter of 2023.
Other Activities
Our long-term financing efforts continued
during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, including the proposed Transaction, discussed above. As funds become available through
the Company’s fundraising efforts, we expect to undertake the following activities:
●
Continuation of the Company’s efforts to secure federal, state, and local permits;
●
Continued evaluation of the potential to produce Rare Earth products;
●
Negotiation and completion of offtake agreements for the remaining uncommitted production from the project;
●
Negotiation and completion of engineering, procurement, and construction agreements;
●
Completion of the final detailed engineering for the underground portion of the Elk Creek Project;
●
Initiation and completion of the final detailed engineering for surface project facilities;
●
Construction of natural gas and electrical infrastructure under existing agreements to serve the Elk Creek Project site;
●
Completion of water supply agreements and related infrastructure to deliver fresh water to the project site;
●
Initiation of revised mine groundwater investigation and control activities;
●
Land clearing operations intended to prepare property owned by ECRC for the commencement of project construction;
●
Initiation of efforts to satisfy conditions of Johnson County’s Special Use Permit, including road upgrades and the provision of additional law enforcement during the construction period;
●
Initiation of long-lead equipment procurement activities; and
●
Completion of the operations of the demonstration plant to address process recommendations contained in the NI 43-101 technical report for the Elk Creek Project filed on SEDAR on May 29, 2019 and to quantify REE metallurgical performance.

Six-month period ended December 31,

Significant items affecting operating expenses
are noted below:
Employee-related costs
decreased
in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to the timing of employee stock option grants. These costs decreased in 2022 as compared
to 2021 due to stock options to purchase Common Shares (“Options”) issued in 2021, which were fully vested and expensed
on the grant date.
Exploration expenditures
increased in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to the timing of demonstration plant development, start-up, and operational
costs incurred in 2022, as well as costs related to the completion and filing of the Technical Report Summary based on the Company’s
2022 Feasibility Study for the Elk Creek Project, which was filed with the SEC on September 6, 2022.
Other operating expenses
include investor relations, general office expenditures, equity offering and proxy expenditures, board-related expenditures,
and other miscellaneous costs. These costs decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to director Options issued in 2021,
which were fully vested and expensed on the grant date. This reduction in costs associated with director Options was partially
offset by increased financial advisory fees and investor relations fees associated with our ongoing financing efforts.
Other significant items impacting the change
in the Company’s net loss are noted below :
Foreign exchange loss
is primarily due to changes in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and reflects the timing of foreign currency transactions,
primarily U.S. dollar-based related party loans, and subsequent changes in exchange rates. The decline in foreign exchange loss
during 2022 as compared 2021 is due to a declining U.S. dollar-based debt balance, partially offset by increased foreign exchange
rates in 2022.
Interest expense
decreased
in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to the impacts of conversions on the outstanding balance of the convertible security (the “Lind
III Convertible Security”) issued to Lind Global Asset Management III, LLC (“Lind”).
27
Three-month period ended December 31,
2022 compared to the three-month period ended December 31, 2021
Overall, the decrease in net loss for the
three-month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily the result of the same factors
underlying the six-month changes in expense categories as discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have no revenue generating operations
from which we can internally generate funds. To date, our ongoing operations have been financed by the sale of our equity securities
by way of private placements, convertible securities issuances, the exercise of incentive Options and Warrants, and related party
loans.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
cash of $0.4 million and a working capital deficit of $6.6 million, compared to cash of $5.3 million and working capital surplus
of $0.6 million on June 30, 2022.
We expect that the Company will operate
at a loss for the foreseeable future. The Company’s current planned cash needs are approximately $13.5 million until June
30, 2023. In addition to outstanding accounts payable and short-term liabilities, our average monthly planned expenditures are
approximately $1,165 per month where approximately $405 is for corporate overhead and estimated costs related to securing financing
necessary for advancement of the Elk Creek Project. Approximately $760 per month is planned for expenditures relating to the advancement
of Elk Creek Project by NioCorp’s wholly owned subsidiary, ECRC. The Company’s ability to continue operations and fund
our current work plan is dependent on management’s ability to secure additional financing.
The Company anticipates that it does not
have sufficient cash to continue to fund basic operations for the next twelve months, and additional funds totaling $13.5 million
to $15.5 million are likely to be necessary to continue advancing the project in the areas of financing, permitting, and detailed
engineering. Management is actively pursuing such additional sources of debt and equity financing, and while it has been successful
in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance it will be able to do so in the future.
Elk Creek property lease commitments are
$12 until June 30, 2023. To maintain our currently held properties and fund our currently anticipated general and administrative
costs and planned exploration and development activities at the Elk Creek Project for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, the
Company will likely require additional financing during the current fiscal year. Should such financing not be available in that
timeframe, we will be required to reduce our activities and will not be able to carry out all our presently planned activities
at the Elk Creek Project.
On September 25, 2022, the Company, GXII
and Merger Sub entered into the Business Combination Agreement. The NioCorp Board of Directors considered a number of factors as
generally supporting its decision to enter into the Business Combination Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following
material factors:
●
Anticipated Acceleration of Financing Efforts . The Transaction has the potential to (1) provide NioCorp with up to $285.0 million in net cash proceeds at the consummation of the Transaction, depending upon the amount of redemptions by GXII public stockholders, and up to an additional $81.0 million over the next three years (as further discussed below), depending on the consummation of other additional financing arrangements that NioCorp and GXII intend to pursue prior to and following the expected closing of the Transaction and (2) significantly accelerate NioCorp’s efforts to obtain the required Elk Creek Project financing by increasing exposure to institutional investors looking to make strategic investments in critical minerals plays that are crucial to the world’s clean energy transition;
●
Non-Binding
Yorkville Term Sheets.
The signing of non-binding LOIs for two separate financing packages with Yorkville. The financings
contemplated by the LOIs include $16.0 million in convertible debentures that are expected to be funded at the closing of
the Transaction, and subject to certain limitations can be repaid by NioCorp in either cash or Common Shares, and a standby
equity purchase facility pursuant to which NioCorp will have the ability to require Yorkville, subject to the conditions set
out in the definitive agreements, to purchase up to $65.0 million of Common Shares;
28
●
Anticipated Benefits of Nasdaq Listing . A listing on Nasdaq, which is an established national exchange in the United States, would provide broader access to capital and financing alternatives and would otherwise enhance NioCorp’s public profile; and
●
Minimum Cash Condition . The consummation of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement, including, among other things, that, at the closing, NioCorp and its subsidiaries (including GXII, as successor by merger to ECRC) will have received cash in an amount equal to or greater than $15.0 million, subject to certain adjustments.
The NioCorp Board of Directors also considered
a variety of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Transaction, including, but not limited
to, the following:
●
Risks of Failure to Complete the Transaction . The risks that:
○
the Transaction may not be completed despite the parties’ efforts, including the possibility that the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the Transaction (which include certain conditions that are not within the control of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement) may not be satisfied or that completion of the Transaction may be unduly delayed, and any resulting adverse impacts on NioCorp, its business and the trading price of Common Shares;
○
the circumstances under which the Business Combination Agreement could be terminated and the impact of such termination, including the requirement that NioCorp must pay GXII (1) a Base Termination Fee of $15.0 million if it terminates the Business Combination Agreement in order to enter into an agreement providing for a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), for a change of recommendation of the NioCorp Board, or a material breach of certain of NioCorp’s covenants relating to soliciting acquisition proposals or (2) an Intentional Breach Termination Fee of $25.0 million if GXII terminates the Business Combination Agreement as a result of a willful and material breach by NioCorp or as a result of NioCorp’s failure to consummate the closing of the Transaction within five business days after all the conditions to closing have been satisfied;
○
if GXII is entitled to the Base Termination Fee or the Intentional Breach Termination Fee upon termination of the Business Combination Agreement, NioCorp is also required to pay all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid or payable by GXII and its sponsor in connection with the Business Combination Agreement and the Transaction, not to exceed $5.0 million; and
○
the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the Transaction, including those incurred regardless of whether the Transaction are completed;
●
Risks Relating to the Benefits of the Transaction. The risks of:
○
not realizing all the anticipated benefits expected as a result of the Transaction, including the anticipated acceleration of its financing efforts and the benefits of the expected Nasdaq listing, and that general economic and market conditions outside the control of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement could deteriorate, any of which could result in NioCorp being unable to achieve the financing necessary to advance, complete construction and commence operation of the Elk Creek Project; and
○
the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the Transaction, including those incurred regardless of whether the anticipated benefits of the Transaction are realized;
●
Restrictions on the Conduct of Business . The Business Combination Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of the NioCorp business prior to the consummation of the Transaction and other alternatives reasonably available to NioCorp if it did not pursue the Transaction, including continuing to pursue alternative financing arrangements.
Except for the Yorkville Financings discussed
in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the heading
“ Recent Corporate Events ,” we currently have no further funding commitments or arrangements for additional financing
at this time, other than the potential exercise of Options and Warrants, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain
any such additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all. The Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement also contains
certain covenants that, among other things, limit NioCorp’s ability to use the proceeds from the Yorkville Convertible Debt
Financing to repay related party debt or to enter into any variable rate transaction, including issuances of equity or debt securities
that are convertible into Common Shares at variable rates and any equity line of credit, ATM agreement or other continuous offering
of Common Shares, other than with Yorkville, subject to certain exceptions. Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in the Business
Combination Agreement and the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement, there is
29
significant uncertainty that we would be
able to secure any additional financing in the current equity or debt markets. The quantity of funds to be raised and the terms
of any proposed equity or debt financing that may be undertaken will be negotiated by management as opportunities to raise funds
arise. In addition to the proposed Transaction and Yorkville Financings, and subject to receipt of the consent of GXII as may be
required pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, management may pursue funding sources of both debt and equity financing,
including but not limited to the issuance of equity securities in the form of Common Shares, Warrants, subscription receipts, or
any combination thereof in units of the Company pursuant to private placements to accredited investors or pursuant to public offerings
in the form of underwritten/brokered offerings, registered direct offerings, or other forms of equity financing and public or private
issuances of debt securities including secured and unsecured convertible debt instruments or secured debt project financing. Management
does not currently know the terms pursuant to which such financings may be completed in the future, but any such financings will
be negotiated at arm’s length. Future financings involving the issuance of equity securities or derivatives thereof will
likely be completed at a discount to the then-current market price of the Company’s securities and will likely be dilutive
to current shareholders. In addition, we could raise funds through the sale of interests in our mineral properties, although current
market conditions and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent worldwide events have substantially reduced the number
of potential buyers/acquirers of any such interests. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to be successful
in raising such funds.
Based on the conditions
described within, management has concluded and the audit opinion and notes that accompany our financial statements for the year
ended June 30, 2022, disclose that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue in business. The financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern.
We are a development stage issuer and we have incurred losses since our inception. We may not have sufficient cash to fund normal
operations and meet debt obligations for the next twelve months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities and raising
additional funds. The COVID-19 pandemic and other recent worldwide events have created general global economic uncertainty as well
as uncertainty in capital markets, supply chain disruptions, increased interest rates, and the potential for geographic recessions.
During fiscal year 2022 and continuing into fiscal year 2023, these events continued to create uncertainty with respect to overall
project funding and timelines. We believe that the going concern uncertainty cannot be alleviated with confidence until the Company
has entered into a business climate where funding of its planned ongoing operating activities is secured. Therefore, these factors
raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
We have no exposure to any asset-backed
commercial paper. Other than cash held by our subsidiaries for their immediate operating needs in Colorado and Nebraska, all of
our cash reserves are on deposit with major U.S. and Canadian chartered banks. We do not believe that the credit, liquidity, or
market risks with respect thereto have increased as a result of the current market conditions. However, in order to achieve greater
security for the preservation of our capital, we have, of necessity, been required to accept lower rates of interest, which has
also lowered our potential interest income.
Operating Activities
During the six months ended December 31,
2022, the Company’s operating activities consumed $4.1 million of cash (2021: $3.0 million). The cash used in operating activities
for the six months ended December 31, 2022, reflects the Company’s funding of losses of $4.8 million, partially offset by
the accretion of convertible debt and other non-cash transactions. Overall, operational outflows during the six months ended December
31, 2022, increased from the corresponding period of 2021 due to an increase in exploration-related spending at the Elk Creek Project.
Going forward, the Company’s working capital requirements are expected to increase substantially in connection with the development
of the Elk Creek Project.
Financing Activities
Financing outflows were $0.5 million during
the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $0.6 million of inflows during the corresponding period in 2021, with 2022 outflows reflecting the timing of vendor payments related to deferred Transaction costs incurred during the period and 2021 inflows primarily
reflecting the timing of warrant and option exercises, partially offset by a partial repayment under the related party
loan with our President, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Executive Chairman, Mark Smith.
30
Cash Flow Considerations
The Company has historically relied upon
debt and equity financings to finance its activities. Subject to the restrictions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement
and the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement, the Company may pursue additional debt and/or equity financing in the medium
term; however, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to obtain any required financing in the future on acceptable
terms.
The Company has limited financial resources
compared to its proposed expenditures, no source of operating income, and no assurance that additional funding will be available
to it for current or future projects, although the Company has been successful in the past in financing its activities through
the sale of equity securities.
The ability of the Company to arrange additional
financing in the future will depend, in part, on the prevailing capital market conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on the timing and availability of funding, and its success in developing the Elk Creek Project. Any quoted market for
the Common Shares may be subject to market trends generally, notwithstanding any potential success of the Company in creating revenue,
cash flows, or earnings, and any depression of the trading price of the Common Shares could impact its ability to obtain equity
financing on acceptable terms.
Historically, the Company has used net
proceeds from issuances of Common Shares to provide sufficient funds to meet its near-term exploration and development plans and
other contractual obligations when due. However, development and construction of the Elk Creek Project will require substantial
additional capital resources. This includes near-term funding and, ultimately, funding for Elk Creek Project construction and other
costs. See “ Liquidity and Capital Resources ” above for the Company’s discussion of arrangements related
to possible future financings.
Critical Accounting Estimates
There have been no material changes in
our critical accounting estimates discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements” as of June
30, 2022, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
NioCorp believes that it qualified as a
“passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) as defined under Section 1297 of the Code, in recent years,
including its taxable years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. However, based on the current composition of its income and
assets, as well as current business plans and financial expectations, NioCorp does not currently expect to be treated as a PFIC
for its taxable year or foreseeable future taxable years. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that must be made
annually at the close of each taxable year and, thus, is subject to change. In addition, it is possible notwithstanding NioCorp’s
conclusion that the IRS could assert, and that a court could sustain, a determination that NioCorp is a PFIC. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that NioCorp (or any of its subsidiaries) will not be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year. Current and prospective
U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of PFIC classification and the U.S. federal tax
treatment of PFICs. Additional information on this matter is included in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, under the heading “Risks Related to the Common Shares.”

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest rate risk
The Company’s exposure to changes
in market interest rates, relates primarily to the Company’s earned interest income on cash deposits and short-term investments.
The Company maintains a balance between the liquidity of cash assets and the interest rate return thereon. The carrying amount
of financial assets, net of any provisions for losses, represents the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Foreign currency exchange risk
The Company incurs expenditures in both
U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars. Canadian dollar expenditures are primarily related to certain Common Share-related costs and
corporate professional services. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operating activities.
To reduce this risk, we maintain sufficient cash balances in Canadian dollars to fund expected near-term expenditures.
Commodity price risk
The Company is exposed to commodity price
risk related to the elements associated with the Elk Creek Project. A significant decrease in the global demand for these elements
may have a material adverse effect on our business. The Elk Creek Project is not in production, and the Company does not currently
hold any commodity derivative positions.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
At the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and
with the participation of our management, including the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting described below.
The Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures have been designed to ensure that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable
rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
32
Management does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and
procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system will be
met and is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, and evaluating controls
and procedures and the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events.
Material Weakness in Internal Control
over Financing Reporting Existing as of December 31, 2022
A material weakness is a deficiency, or
a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.
Our management concluded that we did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, due to a material weakness relating to our
controls, specifically, the Company’s controls over the accounting for non-routine transactions were not adequately designed
to ensure the consideration of all related relevant accounting guidance when such transactions were recorded. This material weakness
resulted in the restatement of the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for Affected Periods. Additionally,
this material weakness could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result in
a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or timely detected.
Remediation Plan for the Material Weakness
In order to remediate the material weakness,
the Company’s management plans to enhance the design of its control over the consideration of all related relevant accounting
guidance for the initial recording and subsequent measurements of non-routine transactions. The material weakness cannot be considered
remediated until the newly designed control activity operates for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through
testing, that all related relevant accounting guidance for non-routine transactions has been considered in connection with the
Company’s normal quarterly close and review procedures for each quarter. Until the material weakness is remediated, we will
continue to perform additional analyses and other post-closing procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We know of no material, active, or pending
legal proceedings against the Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There
are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers, or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse
party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risk
factors discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2022, which could materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition or future results.
The information set forth in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, including without limitation, the risk factors presented below, updates and should be read in conjunction
with, the risk factors and information disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2022.
33
Failure to consummate the Transaction could negatively
impact the price of our Common Shares and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial
position.
The
consummation of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions contained in
the Business Combination Agreement, including, among other things, (i) obtaining required approvals of the Transaction and related
matters by the respective shareholders of NioCorp and GXII, (ii) the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 that
the Company originally filed on November 7, 2022, and amended on December 22, 2022, January 17, 2023, January 31, 2023, and February
6, 2023, and was declared effective by the SEC on February 8, 2023, (iii) receipt of approval for listing on Nasdaq of the Common
Shares to be issued in connection with the Transaction, (iv) receipt of approval for listing on Nasdaq of the Warrants assumed
from GXII, (v) receipt of approval from the TSX with respect to the issuance and listing of the Common Shares issuable in connection
with the Transaction, (vi) that NioCorp and its subsidiaries (including GXII, as successor by merger to ECRC) will have at least
$5.000001 million of net tangible assets upon the consummation of the Transaction, after giving effect to any redemptions by GXII
public stockholders and after payment of underwriters’ fees or commissions, (vii) that, at closing, NioCorp and its subsidiaries
(including GXII, as successor by merger to ECRC) will have received cash in an amount equal to or greater than $15.0 million,
subject to certain adjustments, and (viii) the absence of any injunctions enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Business
Combination Agreement.
Many of the conditions to completion of
the Transaction pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement are not within NioCorp’s or GXII’s control, and we cannot
predict with any certainty when these conditions will be satisfied, if at all. Although NioCorp and GXII are working to complete
the Transaction, satisfying the conditions to and completion of the Transaction may take longer, and could cost more, than we expect.
For example, the requirements for obtaining the required stock exchange clearances and approvals could delay the completion of
the Transaction for a period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Transaction within the expected
timeframe may adversely affect the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Transaction. If any of these conditions are not
satisfied or waived, it is possible that the Business Combination Agreement may be terminated and the Transaction may not be completed.
If the Transaction is not completed for
any reason, including as a result of NioCorp’s shareholders or GXII’s stockholders failing to approve the applicable
proposals or the Business Combination Agreement is otherwise terminated, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected
and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Transaction, we would be subject to a number of risks, including
the following:
●
we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the price of our Common Shares;
●
we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Transaction, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;
●
we may be required to pay a termination fee and reimburse GXII for certain of its expenses under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement;
●
the Business Combination Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of the our business until the earlier of the termination of the Business Combination Agreement and the closing date of the Transaction, which restrictions may have delayed or prevented the us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Business Combination Agreement, may have been pursued;
●
matters relating to the Transaction require substantial commitments of time and resources by management, which could have resulted in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and
●
litigation related to any failure to complete the Transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Business Combination Agreement.
If the Transaction is not completed,
any of the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash
flows, financial position and the price of our Common Shares.
34
If the Transaction is consummated, the Combined Company
may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits expected as a result of the Transaction.
The success of the Transaction, if consummated,
will depend, in part, on the Combined Company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits expected from the Transaction.
In particular, a significant number of GXII shareholders may exercise their redemption rights in connection with the closing of
the Transaction. In addition, the Business Combination Agreement does not make the consummation of the Transaction conditional
on the entry into definitive documentation and consummation of the financing transactions contemplated by the LOIs with Yorkville,
and there is no assurance that such financing transactions will be consummated. As a result, even if the minimum cash and net tangible
asset conditions to closing set forth in the Business Combination Agreement are satisfied and the Transaction is consummated, after
giving effect to (i) payments made to GXII stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights and (ii) payments for potential
taxes and certain expenses incurred by NioCorp and GXII in connection with the Transaction, to the extent not otherwise paid prior
to the closing, the Combined Company may have less net cash proceeds available for general corporate purposes than anticipated.
In addition, the listing of the Common Shares on Nasdaq may not provide the anticipated benefits of broader access to capital and
financing alternatives or otherwise enhance NioCorp’s public profile. If the Combined Company is not successful in realizing
these anticipated benefits, including the anticipated benefits of listing the Common Shares on the Nasdaq and the anticipated acceleration
of financing efforts to advance, complete construction and commence operation of the Elk Creek Project, such consequences may adversely
affect the Combined Company’s results of operations, cash flows, financial position and the price of our Common Shares.
The Yorkville Financings are subject
to satisfaction or waiver of several conditions.
Completion of the Yorkville Financings
are subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent, certain of which are outside of NioCorp’s control, including,
but not limited to, the approval by our shareholders of the issuance of the Common Shares in connection with the Yorkville Equity
Facility Financing, approve by the our shareholders of the issuance of Common Shares in connection with the Yorkville Convertible
Debt Financing, and other customary conditions. A substantial delay in obtaining satisfactory approvals and/or the imposition of
unfavorable terms or conditions in the approvals to be obtained could result in the termination of the Yorkville Equity Facility
Financing Agreement or the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement. There can be no certainty, nor can NioCorp provide any
assurance, that these conditions will be satisfied or, if satisfied, when they will be satisfied. If the Yorkville Equity Facility
Financing or the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing are not completed: (i) certain costs related to the Yorkville Equity Facility
Financing Agreement and the Yorkville Convertible Debt Facility Agreement, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees,
must be paid by NioCorp even if the Yorkville Financings are not completed; (ii) NioCorp may not be successful in finding another
financing opportunity that is of equal or greater benefit to NioCorp; and (iii) the time and attention of NioCorp’s management
will have been diverted away from the conduct of NioCorp’s business.
We may not be able to consummate
the Yorkville Financings in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Even if the Yorkville
Financings are consummated, we face significant related risks, and we may not recognize the full value of the Yorkville Financings.
Completion of the Yorkville Financings
is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent, certain of which are outside of NioCorp’s control, including,
but not limited to, the approval by our shareholders of the issuances of the Common Shares in connection with the Yorkville Equity
Facility Financing and upon the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and the exercise of the Financing Warrants. A failure
in obtaining necessary approvals and/or a failure to satisfy other conditions precedent could result in the termination of the
Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement and the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement. There can be no certainty,
nor can NioCorp provide any assurance, that these conditions will be satisfied or, if satisfied, when they will be satisfied. If
the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing or the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing are not completed: (i) certain costs related
to the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement and the Yorkville Convertible Debt Facility Agreement, such as legal, accounting
and financial advisory fees, must be paid by NioCorp even if the Yorkville Financings are not completed; (ii) NioCorp may not be
successful in finding another financing opportunity that is of equal or greater benefit to NioCorp; (iii) the time and attention
of NioCorp’s management will have been diverted away from the conduct of NioCorp’s business; and (iv) we may not be
able to complete the proposed Transactions, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
35
Even if the Yorkville Financings are consummated,
we may not recognize or the full value of the Yorkville Financings. Specifically, our ability to sell shares to Yorkville pursuant
to the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement is subject to certain restrictions and limitations, which may prevent us from
selling the full Commitment Amount prior to the expiration of the Commitment Period. As a result, there can be no assurance that
NioCorp will receive all or even a significant portion of the proceeds that it expects to receive in connection with the Yorkville
Equity Facility Financing. Further, holders of the Financing Warrants will have the ability to exercise them on a cashless basis.
Accordingly, we may not receive any proceeds from the exercise of the Financing Warrants.
If the Yorkville Financings are consummated,
we will incur significant additional debt upon the issuance of the Convertible Debentures. Notwithstanding whether we are able
to recognize the full value of the Yorkville Financings, we will become obligated to repay or issue Common Shares upon settlement
of the full $16.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures that we have agreed to issue pursuant to the Yorkville
Convertible Debt Financing Agreement. Such significant additional debt could adversely affect our business, which may prevent us
from fulfilling our obligations with respect to our existing debt or obtaining future financing.
Further, the Yorkville Convertible Debt
Financing Agreement restricts us from pursuing certain variable rate financing transactions, which could impair our ability to
obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable, or at all. Our inability to obtain additional financing on terms that
are favorable, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Last, if the Yorkville Financings are consummated,
a significant number of Common Shares would become potentially issuable under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement
and upon the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and the exercise of the Financing Warrants. Additionally, the lower the market
or trading price of our Common Shares in the future, the greater the number of Common Shares potentially issuable under the Yorkville
Equity Facility Financing Agreement and upon the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and the exercise of the Financing Warrants,
would become. Factors both within and beyond our control could cause the market or trading price of our Common Shares to decline,
even significantly, in the future. As a result, existing shareholders will have their positions significantly diluted by the potential
increase in additional outstanding Common Shares due to the issuance of Common Shares under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing
Agreement and upon the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and the exercise of the Financing Warrants. If the Yorkville Financings
are completed, and subject to the terms of the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement and the Yorkville Convertible Debt
Financing Agreement, as applicable, the potential issuances of Common Shares thereunder, the sale of Common Shares in the public
market from time to time, and any disclosures to be made by us relating thereto, could depress the market price for the Common
Shares.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank
Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are
required to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements
are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine
Act”) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”).
During the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries and their properties or operations were
not subject to
36
regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank
Act.
