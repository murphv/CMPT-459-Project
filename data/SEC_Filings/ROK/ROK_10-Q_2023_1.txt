Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies In the opinion of management of Rockwell Automation, Inc. ("Rockwell Automation" or "the Company"), the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented and, except as otherwise indicated, such adjustments consist only of those of a normal, recurring nature. These statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. All date references to years and quarters herein refer to our fiscal year and fiscal quarter, unless otherwise stated. Receivables We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts
of $ 15.7
million at December 31, 2022, and $ 13.1
million at September 30, 2022. In addition, receivables are recorded net of an allowance for certain customer returns, rebates, and incentives of $ 16.3
million at December 31, 2022, and $ 13.9
million at September 30, 2022. The changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were not material and primarily consisted of current-period provisions, write-offs charged against the allowance, recoveries collected, and foreign currency translation. Earnings Per Share The following table reconciles basic and Diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts (in millions, except per share amounts): Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation, Inc. $ 384.0   $ 241.5   Less: Allocation to participating securities ( 1.5 ) ( 0.7 ) Net income available to common shareowners $ 382.5   $ 240.8   Basic weighted average outstanding shares 114.8   116.0   Effect of dilutive securities Stock options 0.6   1.1   Performance shares 0.1   0.2   Diluted weighted average outstanding shares 115.5   117.3   Earnings per share: Basic $ 3.33   $ 2.08   Diluted $ 3.31   $ 2.05   For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were
0.6
million and
0.3
million shares, respectively, related to share-based compensation awards that were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because they were antidilutive.
Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities Capital expenditures of $ 32.9
million and $ 27.3
million were accrued within Accounts payable and Other current liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, there were $ 0.8
million and $ 1.4
million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in Accounts payable that did not settle until the next quarter. These non-cash investing and financing activities have been excluded from cash used for capital expenditures and treasury stock purchases in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 9 Table of Contents ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard that requires companies to apply Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. We retroactively adopted the new standard as of October 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2022, the FASB issued a new standard, which requires the buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose information about the key terms of the program, outstanding confirmed amounts as of the end of the period, a rollforward of such amounts during each annual period, and a description of where in the financial statements outstanding amounts are presented. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard on our financial statement disclosures. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 2.
Revenue Recognition Nature of Products and Services Substantially all of our revenue is from contracts with customers. We recognize revenue as promised products are transferred to, or services are performed for, customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products and services. Our offerings consist of industrial automation and information products, solutions, and services. Our products include hardware, software, and configured-to-order products. Our solutions include custom-engineered systems and software. Our services include customer technical support and repair, asset management and optimization consulting, and training. Also included in our services is a portion of revenue related to spare parts that are managed within our services offering. Our operations are comprised of the Intelligent Devices segment, the Software & Control segment, and the Lifecycle Services segment. Revenue from the Intelligent Devices and Software & Control segments is predominantly comprised of product sales, which are recognized at a point in time. The Software & Control segment also contains revenue from software products, which may be recognized over time if certain criteria are met. Revenue from the Lifecycle Services segment is predominantly comprised of solutions and services, which are primarily recognized over time. See Note 15 for more information. Unfulfilled Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2022, we expect to recognize approximately $ 1,260  million of revenue in future periods from unfulfilled performance obligations from existing contracts with customers. We expect to recognize revenue of approximately $ 625
million from our remaining performance obligations over the next
12
months with the remaining balance recognized thereafter. We have applied the practical expedient to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original term of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed. The amounts above also do not include the impact of contract renewal options that are unexercised as of December 31, 2022. 10 Table of Contents ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) Disaggregation of Revenue The following table presents our revenue disaggregation by geographic region for our

The most significant changes in our Contract liabilities balance during the three months ended December 31, 2021, were due to amounts billed, partially offset by revenue recognized that was included in the Contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the period. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized revenue of approximately $ 200.9  million that was included in the Contract liabilities balance at September 30, 2022. In the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized revenue of approximately $ 141.6  million that was included in the Contract liabilities balance at September 30, 2021. We did
no t have a material amount of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods. 11 Table of Contents ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) 3.
Share-Based Compensation We recognized $ 18.4
million and $ 15.5
million of pre-tax share-based compensation expense during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual grant of share-based compensation takes place during the first quarter of each year.

Acquisitions 2023 Acquisition In October 2022, we acquired CUBIC, a company that specializes in modular systems for the construction of electrical panels, headquartered in Bronderslev, Denmark. We recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with this acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of October 31, 2022.
The preliminary aggregate purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions): Purchase Price Allocation Receivables $ 21.3   Inventories 17.7   Property 27.0   Goodwill 64.5   Other intangible assets 36.4   All other assets 1.5   Total assets acquired 168.4   Less: Total liabilities assumed ( 34.6 ) Net assets acquired, excluding cash $ 133.8   Purchase Consideration Total purchase consideration, net of cash acquired $ 133.8   We assigned the full amount of goodwill and all other net assets acquired related to this acquisition to our Intelligent Devices segment. The goodwill recorded represents intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. We do not expect the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. 12 Table of Contents ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited) The allocation of the purchase price to identifiable assets above is based on the preliminary valuations performed to determine the fair value of the net assets as of the acquisition date. The measurement period for the valuation of net assets acquired ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date becomes available, but not to exceed 12 months following the acquisition date. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to net assets acquired during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. 2022 Acquisitions In November 2021, we acquired AVATA, a services provider for supply chain management, enterprise resource planning, and enterprise performance management solutions. We assigned the full amount of goodwill related to this acquisition to our Lifecycle Services segment. In March 2022, we, through our Sensia affiliate, acquired Swinton Technology, a provider of metering supervisory systems and measurement expertise in the Oil & Gas industry. We assigned the full amount of goodwill related to this acquisition to our Lifecycle Services segment. Pro forma consolidated sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $ 2.0  billion and $ 1.9  billion, respectively, and the impact on earnings was  not
material. The preceding pro forma consolidated financial results of operations are as if the preceding 2023 and 2022 acquisitions occurred on October 1, 2021. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the transaction occurred as of that time. Total sales and acquisition-related costs from all of the above 2023 and 2022 acquisitions in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were
no t material. 6.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill for the three months ended December 31, 2022, were (in millions): Intelligent Devices Software & Control Lifecycle Services Total Balance as of September 30, 2022 $ 503.0   $ 2,398.7   $ 622.3   $ 3,524.0   Acquisition of business 64.5   —   —   64.5   Translation 19.1   22.4   10.6   52.1   Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 586.6   $ 2,421.1   $ 632.9   $ 3,640.6   We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment during the second quarter of each year, or more frequently, if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We assessed the changes in events and circumstances during the first quarter of 2023 and concluded that no triggering events, which would require interim quantitative testing, occurred. 13 Table of Contents ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC.

shares of PTC Inc. ("PTC") common stock (the "PTC Shares") at December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, respectively. The PTC Shares are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as described below, and are recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet using the most recent closing price of PTC common stock quoted on Nasdaq. Equity securities (other) consist of various securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, which we account for using the measurement alternative under U.S. GAAP. These securities are recorded at the investment cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly transactions) of an identical or similar investment of the same issuer in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Observable price changes are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described below. The carrying values at December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, include cumulative upward adjustments from observed price changes of $ 17.2  million. 15 Table of Contents ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC.

U.S. GAAP also classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: Level 1:   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2:   Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3:   Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. We did not have any transfers between levels of fair value measurements during the period presented. 10.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Various lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, and contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The following outlines additional background for obligations associated with asbestos, divested businesses, and intellectual property. We (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago, including products from divested businesses for which we have agreed to defend and indemnify claims. Currently there are lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of the products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition caused by our products. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants. Additionally, we have maintained insurance coverage that includes indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for many of these claims. We believe these arrangements will provide substantial coverage for future defense and indemnity costs for these asbestos claims for many years into the future. The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims, and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances, the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so. We do not believe these liabilities will have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale and at times in other contracts with third parties. As of December 31, 2022, we were not aware of any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible of an unfavorable outcome. Historically, claims that have been made under the indemnification agreements have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations in a particular period. 19 Table of Contents ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC.

Income Taxes At the end of each interim period, we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full year based on our most recent forecast of pre-tax income, permanent book and tax differences, and global tax planning strategies. We use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis, excluding the effect of significant unusual items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects in the period in which they occur. The effective tax rate was
19.1
percent in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to
15.4
percent in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of
21
percent in the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower non-U.S. tax rates. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of
21
percent in the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to excess income tax benefits of share-based compensation and lower non-U.S. tax rates. An income tax liability of $ 233.7  million related to the U.S. transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") that is payable greater than 12 months after both December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Unrecognized Tax Benefits The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 3.9
million at both December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, of which the entire amount would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1.4
million at both December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. We believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to $ 3.4
million in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the lapses of statutes of limitations. If all of the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, the net reduction to our income tax provision, including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets, could be up to $ 4.9
million. We conduct business globally and are routinely audited by the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years before 2018, state and local income tax examinations for years before 2014 and foreign income tax examinations for years before 2008. 20 Table of Contents ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareowners' equity for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareowners’ equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated November 8, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin January 26, 2023 22 Table of Contents Item 2.

Overview Rockwell Automation, Inc. is a global leader in industrial automation and digital transformation. We connect the imaginations of people with the potential of technology to expand what is humanly possible, making the world more productive and more sustainable. Overall demand for our hardware and software products, solutions, and services is driven by: • investments in manufacturing, including upgrades, modifications and expansions of existing facilities or production lines, and new facilities or production lines; • investments in basic materials production capacity, which may be related to commodity pricing levels; • our customers’ needs for faster time to market, operational productivity, asset management and reliability, and enterprise risk management; • our customers’ needs to continuously improve quality, safety, and sustainability; • industry factors that include our customers’ new product introductions, demand for our customers’ products or services, and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate; • levels of global industrial production and capacity utilization; • regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory, and economic circumstances; and • the spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes and their working schedules. Long-term Strategy Our strategy is to bring The Connected Enterprise (R)
to life by integrating control and information across the enterprise. We deliver customer outcomes by combining advanced industrial automation with the latest information technology. Our growth and performance strategy seeks to: • achieve organic sales growth in excess of the automation market by expanding our served market and strengthening our competitive differentiation; • grow market share of our core platforms; • drive double digit growth in information solutions and connected services; • drive double digit growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR); • acquire companies that serve as catalysts to organic growth by increasing our information solutions and high-value services offerings and capabilities, advanced material handling, and expanding our global presence; • enhance our market access by building our channel capability and partner network; • deploy human and financial resources to strengthen our technology leadership and our intellectual capital business model; • continuously improve quality and customer experience; and • drive annual cost productivity. By implementing the above strategy, we seek to achieve our long-term financial goals, including above-market organic sales growth, increasing the portion of our total revenue that is recurring in nature, EPS growth above sales growth, return on invested capital in excess of 20 percent, and free cash flow equal to about 100 percent of adjusted income. We expect acquisitions to add a percentage point or more per year to long-term sales growth. O ur customers face the challenge of remaining globally cost competitive and automation can help them achieve their productivity and sustainability objectives. Our value proposition is to help our customers reduce time to market, lower total cost of ownership, improve asset utilization, and manage enterprise risks. 24 Table of Contents U.S. Economic Trends In the first quarter of 2023, sales in the U.S. accounted for over half of our total sales. The various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served U.S. markets include: • The Industrial Production (IP) Index, published by the Federal Reserve, which measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. The IP Index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year, currently 2017. Historically, there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the IP Index and the level of automation investment made by our U.S. customers in their manufacturing base. • The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which indicates the current and near-term state of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting. The table below depicts trends in these indicators since the quarter ended September 2021. These figures are as of January 26, 2023, and are subject to revision by the issuing organizations. The IP Index declined in the first quarter of 2023 versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Manufacturing PMI results also softened in the first quarter of 2023. The reading in the month of December was the lowest of the quarter and the second consecutive month below 50. IP Index PMI 2023 quarter ended: December 2022 101.0 48.4 2022 quarter ended: September 2022 101.7 50.9 June 2022 101.8 53.0 March 2022 101.1 57.1 December 2021 100.1 58.8 2021 quarter ended: September 2021 98.8 60.5 Inflation in the U.S. has also had an impact on our input costs and pricing. We used the Producer Price Index (PPI), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI for December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, increased 6.2 percent, 8.5 percent, 11.2 percent, 11.7 percent, and 10.0 percent, respectively, compared to the same period a year ago. These figures are as of January 26, 2023, and are subject to revision by the issuing organization. Although higher than historic measures, the PPI year over year increase has declined over the past three quarters.
Non-U.S. Economic Trends In the first quarter of 2023, sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for less than half of our total sales. These customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with a global presence. In addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the
Overview
section, international demand, particularly in emerging markets, has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region, investments in infrastructure, and expanding consumer markets. We use changes in key countries' gross domestic product (GDP), IP, and PMI as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business. Industrial Output outside the U.S. was lower in the first quarter of 2023 versus the fourth quarter of 2022. PMI readings were mostly lower in the first quarter of 2023 and readings for many countries ended the quarter below 50. Supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and global inflation remain persistent, along with elevated geopolitical instability. 25 Table of Contents Supply Chain We have a global supply chain, including a network of suppliers and distribution and manufacturing facilities. The supply chain has been stressed by increased demand, along with pandemic-related and other global events that have put additional pressures on manufacturing output. Although there has been a gradual improvement in the supply chain environment, this has resulted in and could continue to result in: • challenges in our supply chain; • difficulty in procuring or inability to procure components and materials necessary for our hardware and software products, solutions, and services; • increased costs for commodities and components; and • delays in delivering, or an inability to deliver, our hardware and software products, solutions, and services. We are closely managing our end-to-end supply chain, from sourcing to production to customer delivery, with a particular focus on all critical and at-risk suppliers and supplier locations globally. We have made large-scale investments to increase capacity across our network in support of our orders growth. Additional actions we are taking include: • extending order visibility to our supply base to ensure we are appropriately planning for extended component lead times; • securing longer-term supply agreements with critical partners; • re-engineering of existing products to increase component supply resiliency; • capacity investments, including redundant manufacturing lines and additional electronic assembly equipment; and • qualification of additional suppliers to diversify our supplier base. We believe these and other actions we are taking will over time normalize our product lead times and reduce our backlog. COVID-19 Pandemic We continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies. Uncertainty on the duration and severity of those impacts remains due to the evolving nature of the pandemic, government responses to it, and regulations across the geographies in which our business operates. We are continuously responding to the changing conditions created by the pandemic and evolving regulations and remain focused on our priorities including employee health and safety, our customer needs, and protecting critical investments to drive long-term differentiation. Outlook The table below provides guidance for sales growth and earnings per share for 2023 as of January 26, 2023. Our updated guidance reflects first quarter performance and record backlog.

Total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, corporate and other, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit credit, change in fair value of investments, interest expense, net, and income tax provision because we do not consider these items to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. We believe total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies. (3)
Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP earnings measure. See

Corporate and other expenses were $27.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $29.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Income before Income Taxes In come
befo re income taxes was $467.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $282.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to fair value adjustments recognized in 2023 compared to 2022 in connection with our investment in PTC (the "PTC adjustments") as well as higher sales, partially offset by higher input costs. Total segment operating earnings increased 12.9 percent in the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher sales, including pricing increases, partially offset by higher input costs and higher investment spend. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was 19.1 percent compared to 15.4 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was 17.1 percent compared to 15.3 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced excess income tax benefits from share-based compensation. Diluted EPS and Adjusted EPS 2023 first quarter Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation was $384.0 million or $3.31 per share, compared to $241.5 million or $2.05 per share in the first quarter of 2022. The increases in Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and diluted EPS were primarily due to the PTC adjustments and higher sales, partially offset by higher input costs. 2023 first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.46, up 15.0 percent compared to $2.14 in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher input costs. 28 Table of Contents Intelligent Devices Sales Intelligent Devices sales increased 4.0 percent year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 6.6 percent year over year, currency translation decreased sales by 4.1 percentage points year over year, and the acquisition of CUBIC increased sales by 1.5 percentage points year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, reported and organic sales increased in all regions. Segment Operating Margin Intelligent Devices segment operating earnings decreased 1.7 percent year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Segment operating margin decreased to 22.4 percent in the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 23.7 percent in the same period a year ago. The decrease from the prior year includes higher investment spend and an unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by the net positive impact from pricing increases.
Software & Control Sales Software & Control sales increased 11.6 percent year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Software & Control organic sales increased 15.5 percent year over year and currency translation decreased sales by 3.9 percentage points year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, reported sales increased in North America and Latin America but decreased in EMEA and Asia Pacific. All regions experienced organic sales growth in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Segment Operating Margin Software & Control segment operating earnings increased 42.3 percent year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Segment operating margin increased to 29.2 percent in the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 22.9 percent in the same period a year ago, primarily driven by higher sales, including pricing increases, and the favorable year-over-year impact from the Plex acquisition, partially offset by higher input costs. Lifecycle Services Sales Lifecycle Services sales increased 6.4 percent year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Lifecycle Services organic sales increased 10.2 percent year over year, currency translation decreased sales by 4.2 percentage points year over year, and acquisitions increased sales by 0.4 percentage points year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. All regions experienced growth in reported and organic sales in the three months ended December 31, 2022, except for Latin America. Segment Operating Margin Lifecycle Services segment operating earnings decreased 0.8 percent year over year in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Segment operating margin decreased to 5.2 percent in the three months ended December 31, 2022, from 5.5 percent in the same period a year ago. 29 Table of Contents Supplemental Segment Information Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and non-operating pension and postretirement benefit credit are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment's operating performance for internal purposes. If we were to allocate these costs, we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows (in millions):   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization Intelligent Devices $ 1.0  $ 0.7  Software & Control 16.9  17.3  Lifecycle Services 7.8  7.9  Non-operating pension and postretirement benefit credit Intelligent Devices $ (3.9) $ (2.1) Software & Control (3.9) (2.1) Lifecycle Services (5.3) (2.8) 30 Table of Contents Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation Adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension and postretirement benefit credit, purchase accounting depreciation and amortization attributable to Rockwell Automation, change in fair value of investments, and Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, including their respective tax effects. Non-operating pension and postretirement benefit credit is defined as all components of our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit (credit) cost except for service cost. See Note 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit (credit) cost. We believe that adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. Adjusted EPS is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measures of adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation, diluted EPS, and effective tax rate.

Guidance as of January 26, 2023. 32 Table of Contents Financial Condition The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions):   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $ 66.3  $ (12.0) Investing activities (18.3) (48.7) Financing activities (105.3) (52.0) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 18.0  (9.5) Decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (39.3) $ (122.2) The following table summarizes free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure (in millions):   Three Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ 66.3  $ (12.0) Capital expenditures (24.2) (37.1) Free cash flow $ 42.1  $ (49.1) Our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. Cash provided by (used for) operating activities adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations, if any. Operating, investing, and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations, if any, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends, and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies. Cash provided by (used for) operating activities was $66.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $(12.0) million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Free cash flow was $42.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $(49.1) million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The year over year increases in cash provided by (used for) operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to higher pre-tax income and lower income tax payments in the first three months of 2022 compared to the first three months of 2021, partially offset by increases in working capital. In December 2021, the Company entered a 10b5-1 plan related to our PTC Shares, pursuant to which a broker makes periodic sales of some of our PTC Shares on behalf of the Company, subject to the terms of the plan. Starting in June 2022, the Company made periodic sales of our PTC Shares in the open market, outside of the parameters of the existing 10b5-1 plan. In December 2022, the original 10b5-1 plan was completed and a new 10b5-1 plan related to our PTC Shares was entered into by the Company. All of our sales of PTC are consistent with the transfer restrictions in the securities purchase agreement, as amended, with PTC. As of December 31, 2022, the fiscal year-to-date sales of our PTC shares under our 10b5-1 plan and open market sales resulted in a gross inflow of $144.8 million. There were no fiscal year-to-date sales as of December 31, 2021. This excludes any tax liability related to the realized gain on investment. These proceeds, and any proceeds from future sales, will support our future uses of cash. Our Short-term debt as of December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, includes commercial paper borrowings of $462.0 million and $317.0 million, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of 4.40 percent and 3.03 percent, respectively, and weighted average maturity periods of 22 days at both December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, Sensia entered into an unsecured $75.0 million line of credit and borrowed $50.0 million, with an interest rate of 5.35 percent, which is also included in Short-term debt. Also included in Short-term debt as of December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, is $23.5 million and $42.3 million, respectively, of interest-bearing loans from SLB to Sensia, due December 29, 2023. 33 Table of Contents We repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in the first three months of 2023. The total cost of these shares was $156.0 million, of which $0.8 million was recorded in Accounts payable at December 31, 2022, related to shares that did not settle until January 2023. At September 30, 2022, there were $1.6 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in Accounts payable. We repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in the first three months of 2022. The total cost of these shares was $49.4 million, of which $1.4 million was recorded in Accounts payable at December 31, 2021, related to shares that did not settle until January 2022. Our decision to repurchase shares in the remainder of 2023 will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements, and stock price. On both July 24, 2019, and May 2, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized us to expend an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1,095.3 million remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations. See Part II, Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds , for additional information regarding share repurchases. We expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements, capital expenditures, additional contributions to our retirement plans, acquisitions of businesses and other inorganic investments, dividends to shareowners, repurchases of common stock, and repayments of debt. We expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings, or new issuances of debt or other securities. In addition, we have access to unsecured credit facilities with various banks. At December 31, 2022, the majority of our Cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of the broad changes to the U.S. international tax system under the Tax Act, the Company accounts for taxes on earnings of substantially all of its non-U.S. subsidiaries including both non-U.S. and U.S. taxes. The Company has concluded that earnings of a limited number of its non-U.S. subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. In June 2022, we replaced our former $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new five-year $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, expiring in June 2027. We can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to $750.0 million, subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility. We did not borrow against this credit facility or the former credit facility during the periods ended December 31, 2022, or September 30, 2022. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of this credit facility contain covenants under which we agree to maintain an EBITDA-to-interest ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0. The EBITDA-to-interest ratio is defined in the credit facility as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the facility) for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period. LIBOR was the primary basis for determining interest payments on borrowings under our former $1.25 billion credit facility. Our new $1.5 billion credit facility uses the secured overnight funding rate (SOFR) as the primary basis for determining interest payments. Among other uses, we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the short-term credit ratings set forth in the table below. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures. Separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $217.2 million at December 31, 2022, were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries, of which, approximately $30.8 million was committed under letters of credit. Borrowings under our non-U.S. credit facilities at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, were not significant. We were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. There are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under our credit facilities. The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of December 31, 2022: Credit Rating Agency Short-Term Rating Long-Term Rating Outlook Standard & Poor’s A-1 A Negative Moody’s P-2 A3 Stable Fitch Ratings F1 A Stable Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions. We have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. 34 Table of Contents We regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. We also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. In addition, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities' functional currencies. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Net gains and losses related to derivative forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges offset the related gains and losses on the hedged items during the periods in which the hedged items are recognized in earnings. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we reclassified $12.7 million in pre-tax net gains related to cash flow hedges from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we reclassified $1.8 million in pre-tax net losses related to cash flow hedges from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We expect that approximately $16.0 million of pre-tax net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022, will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. Information with respect to our contractual cash obligations is contained in Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. We believe that at December 31, 2022, there has been no material change to this information. 35 Table of Contents Supplemental Sales Information We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. Sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period.
