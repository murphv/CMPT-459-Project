SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and GAAP. The September 30, 2022 Balance Sheet data is derived from the audited financial statements of the Company. These Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NJR and its subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Because of the seasonal nature of the Company's utility and wholesale energy services operations, in addition to other factors, the financial results for the interim periods presented are not indicative of the results that are to be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period. On a quarterly basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a need, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the calculation of the fair value of derivative instruments, debt, equity method investments, unbilled revenues, allowance for doubtful accounts, provisions for depreciation and amortization, long-lived assets, regulatory assets and liabilities, income taxes, pensions and other postemployment benefits, contingencies related to environmental matters and litigation. Asset retirement obligations are evaluated periodically as required. The Company’s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company has legal, regulatory and environmental proceedings during the normal course of business that can result in loss contingencies. When evaluating the potential for a loss, the Company will establish a reserve if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, in which case it is the Company’s policy to accrue the full amount of such estimates. Where the information is sufficient only to establish a range of probable liability, and no point within the range is more likely than any other, it is the Company’s policy to accrue the lower end of the range. In the normal course of business, estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has spread globally, including throughout the U.S. The Company’s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented. The Company considered the impacts of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there have been no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of operations as of December 31, 2022. The Company continues to closely monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and has, when appropriate, taken steps to ensure business continuity in the safe operation of its business. These steps include working from home for office-based employees utilizing a hybrid schedule and limiting direct contact with customers. While the Company and many businesses generally have returned to normal operating practices, this remains an evolving situation. The timing for recovery of businesses and local economies, resurgences or mutations of the virus, and any potential future shutdowns remains unknown. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has continued to provide essential services to our customers. Both the Company and NJNG continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet their current obligations and business operations remain fundamentally unchanged at this time. The Company will continue to monitor developments affecting its employees, customers, and operations and take additional steps to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts, as necessary. The Company considered the impacts of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there have been no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of operations as of December 31, 2022. Revenues Revenues from the sale of natural gas to NJNG customers are recognized in the period that natural gas is delivered and consumed by customers, including an estimate for unbilled revenue. NJNG records unbilled revenue for natural gas services. Natural gas sales to individual customers are based on meter readings, which are performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, the amount of natural gas delivered to each customer after the last meter reading through the end of the respective accounting period is estimated, and recognizes unbilled revenues related to these amounts. The unbilled revenue estimates are based on estimated customer usage by customer type, weather effects, unaccounted-for natural gas and the most current tariff rates. Clean Energy Ventures recognizes revenue when SRECs are transferred to counterparties. SRECs are physically delivered through the transfer of certificates as per contractual settlement schedules. The Clean Energy Act of 2018 established guidelines for the closure of the SREC registration program to new applicants in New Jersey. The SREC program officially closed to new qualified solar projects on April 30, 2020. In December 2019, the BPU established the TREC as the successor to the SREC program. TRECs provide a fixed compensation base multiplied by an assigned project factor in order to determine their value. The project factor is determined by the type and location of the project, as defined. In July 2021, the BPU established a new successor solar incentive program. This Administratively Determined Incentive Program, which we refer to as SREC IIs, provides administratively set incentives for net metered residential projects and net metered non-residential projects of
5
MW or less. TREC & SREC IIs generated are required to be purchased monthly by a REC program administrator as appointed by the BPU. Revenue is recognized when RECs are generated and are transferred monthly based upon metered solar electricity activity. Revenues for Energy Services are recognized when the natural gas is physically delivered to the customer. In addition, changes in the fair value of derivatives that economically hedge the forecasted sales of the natural gas are recognized in operating revenues as they occur. Energy Services also recognizes changes in the fair value of SREC derivative contracts as a component of operating revenues. During December 2020, Energy Services entered into a series of AMAs with an investment grade public utility to release pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts, which commenced on November 1, 2021. The AMAs include a series of temporary and permanent releases and revenue under these agreements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. For temporary releases of pipeline capacity, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the agreed upon term. For permanent releases of pipeline capacity, which represent a transfer of contractual rights for such capacity, revenue is recognized upon the transfer of the underlying contractual rights. Energy Services recognized $ 20.0
million and $ 22.1
million of operating revenue on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amounts received in excess of revenue totaling $ 87.2
million and $ 33.8
million are included in deferred revenue on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Storage and Transportation generates revenues from firm storage contracts and transportation contracts, related usage fees and hub services for the use of storage space, injections and withdrawals from their natural gas storage facility and the delivery of natural gas to customers. Demand fees are recognized as revenue over the term of the related agreement while usage fees and hub services revenues are recognized as services are performed. Revenues from all other activities are recorded in the period during which products or services are delivered and accepted by customers, or over the related contractual term.

Note 3. Revenue
for further information. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less, and excludes restricted cash related to escrow balances for utility plant projects at NJNG, which are recorded in other noncurrent assets on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total amounts in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows: (Thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,407   $ 1,107   $ 1,259   Restricted cash in other noncurrent assets $ 461   $ 345   $ 1,294   Statements of Cash Flow Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 2,868   $ 1,452   $ 2,553   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company segregates financial assets, primarily trade receivables and unbilled revenues due in one year or less, into portfolio segments based on shared risk characteristics, such as geographical location and regulatory environment, for evaluation of expected credit losses. Historical and current information, such as average write-offs, are applied to each portfolio segment to estimate the allowance for losses on uncollectible receivables. Additionally, the allowance for losses on uncollectible receivables is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, which can include changing weather, commodity prices, regulations, and macroeconomic factors, such as unemployment rates among others, including the estimated impact of the ongoing pandemic on the outstanding balances. Loans Receivable NJNG currently provides loans, with terms ranging from
two
to
10
years, to customers that elect to purchase and install certain energy-efficient equipment in accordance with its BPU-approved SAVEGREEN program. The loans are recognized at fair value on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company has $ 14.8
million and $ 14.5
million recorded in other current assets as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, and $ 34.7
million in other noncurrent assets as of both December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, related to the loans. The Company regularly evaluates the credit quality and collection profile of its customers. If NJNG determines a loan is impaired, the basis of the loan would be subject to regulatory review for recovery. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company has not recorded any impairments for SAVEGREEN loans. Natural Gas in Storage The following table summarizes natural gas in storage, at average cost by segment as of: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 ($ in thousands) Natural Gas in Storage Bcf Natural Gas in Storage Bcf Natural Gas Distribution $ 152,010   22.0   $ 191,175   29.0   Energy Services 102,350   18.1   82,469   10.8   Total $ 254,360   40.1   $ 273,644   39.8   Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs, such as software design and configuration, coding, testing and installation, that are incurred to purchase or create and implement computer software for internal use. Capitalized costs include external costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the internal-use software project. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is probable that such expenditures will result in additional functionality. Amortization is recorded on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The following tables present the software costs included in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: (Thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Balance Sheets Utility plant, at cost $ 46,066   $ 40,437   Construction work in progress $ 22,619   $ 14,381   Nonutility plant and equipment, at cost $ 344   $ 344   Accumulated depreciation and amortization, utility plant $ ( 4,229 ) $ ( 3,361 ) Accumulated depreciation and amortization, nonutility plant and equipment $ ( 28 ) $ ( 25 ) Software costs $ 6,649   $ 6,120   Three Months Ended December 31, Statements of Operations 2022 2021 Operation and maintenance
(1) $ 3,753   $ 2,523   Depreciation and amortization $ 871   $ 299   (1) During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $ 114,000
and $ 113,000 , respectively, was amortized from software costs into O&M. Sale Leasebacks NJNG utilizes sale leaseback arrangements as a financing mechanism to fund certain of its capital expenditures related to natural gas meters, whereby the physical asset is sold concurrent with an agreement to lease the asset back. These agreements include options to renew the lease or repurchase the asset at the end of the term. Proceeds from sale leaseback transactions are accounted for as financing arrangements and are included in long-term debt on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NJNG received $ 8.4
million and $ 17.3
million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in connection with the sale leaseback of its natural gas meters. In addition, for certain of its commercial solar energy projects, the Company enters into lease agreements that provide for the sale of commercial solar energy assets to third parties and the concurrent leaseback of the assets. For sale leaseback transactions where the Company has concluded that the arrangement does not qualify as a sale as the Company retains control of the underlying assets, the Company uses the financing method to account for the transaction. Under the financing method, the Company recognizes the proceeds received from the buyer-lessor that constitute a payment to acquire the solar energy asset as a financing arrangement, which is recorded as a component of debt on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Clean Energy Ventures received proceeds of $ 33.2
million and $ 3.3
million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in connection with sale leasebacks of commercial solar assets. The proceeds received were recognized as a financing obligation on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Clean Energy Ventures simultaneously entered into agreements to lease the assets back over a term of
five
to
15
years. The Company continues to operate the solar assets and is responsible for related expenses and entitled to retain the revenue generated from SRECs, TRECs, SREC IIs and energy sales. The ITCs and other tax benefits associated with these solar projects transfer to the buyer; however, the payments are structured so that Clean Energy Ventures is compensated for the transfer of the related tax attributes. Accordingly, Clean Energy Ventures recognizes the equivalent value of the tax attributes in other income on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations over the respective five-year ITC recapture periods, starting with the second year of the lease. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related tax effects during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: (Thousands) Cash Flow Hedges Postemployment Benefit Obligation Total Balance at September 30, 2022 $ ( 8,322 ) $ 3,496   $ ( 4,826 ) Other comprehensive income, net of tax Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax of $( 79 ), $( 12 ) and $( 91 ), respectively 263   41   (1) 304   Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 8,059 ) $ 3,537   $ ( 4,522 ) Balance at September 30, 2021 $ ( 9,376 ) $ ( 25,152 ) $ ( 34,528 ) Other comprehensive income, net of tax Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax of $( 79 ), $( 233 ) and $( 312 ), respectively 264   766   (1) 1,030   Balance at December 31, 2021 $ ( 9,112 ) $ ( 24,386 ) $ ( 33,498 ) (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost, a component of operations and maintenance expense on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Recently Adopted Updates to the Accounting Standards Codification Debt and Other In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, an amendment to ASC 470,
Debt , and ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging , which changes the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of acceptable accounting models to three models including, the embedded derivative, substantial premium, and traditional no proceeds allocated models. The Company adopted this guidance on October 1, 2022, and as the Company does not currently have convertible debt instruments, there was no impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures upon adoption. In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, an amendment to ASC 470,
Debt , ASC 260,
Earnings per Share , ASC 718,
Stock Compensation , and ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging.
The update impacts equity-classified written call options that remain equity-classified after a modification or exchange. The Company adopted this guidance on October 1, 2022, on a prospective basis. As the Company does not currently have equity-classified written call options, there was no impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures upon adoption. Leases In July 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-05, an amendment to ASC 842,
Leases , which requires a lessor to classify a lease with entirely or partially variable payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease if another classification, including sales-type or direct financing would trigger a loss at the lease commencement date. The Company adopted this guidance on October 1, 2022, on a prospective basis. The Company currently does not have any leases that meet this criteria, so there was no material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures upon adoption. 9 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Other Recent Updates to the Accounting Standards Codification Business Combinations In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, an amendment to ASC 805,
Business Combinations , which requires that an acquirer recognize, and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2023, and will be applied on a prospective basis to new acquisitions following the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the amendment to understand the impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures upon adoption. Derivatives and Hedging In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, an amendment to ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging , which addresses fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets. This update further clarifies guidance previously released in ASU 2017-12 which established the "last-of-layer" method and this update renames that method as the “portfolio layer” method. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2023, and the transition method can be on a prospective basis for a multiple-layer hedging strategy or a modified retrospective basis for a portfolio layer method. As the Company does not currently apply hedge accounting to any of its risk management activities, it does not expect the amendment to have an impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures upon adoption. Financial Instruments In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, an amendment to ASC 326,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , which eliminates the accounting guidance for creditors in troubled debt restructuring. It also aligns conflicting disclosure requirement guidance in ASC 326 by requiring disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination. The amendment also adds new disclosures for creditors with loan refinancing and restructuring for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2023, and the Company can elect to apply it either on a modified retrospective or prospective basis. At this time, the Company has not experienced a troubled debt restructuring and does not expect the amendments to have an impact on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the amendment to understand the impact on its disclosures upon adoption. Fair Value Measurement In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, an amendment to ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurement , The amendment clarifies the fair value principles when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to a contractual sale restriction. The guidance is effective for the Company on October 1, 2024, and will be applied on a prospective basis. At this time, the Company does not have equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, and therefore this amendment would only impact the Company upon adoption if, in the future, it entered into such transactions. 3.
REVENUE Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer using the output method of progress. The Company elected to apply the invoice practical expedient for recognizing revenue, whereby the amounts invoiced to customers represent the value to the customer and the Company’s performance completion as of the invoice date. Therefore, the Company does not disclose related unsatisfied performance obligations. The Company also elected the practical expedient to exclude from the transaction price all sales taxes that are assessed by a governmental authority and therefore presents sales tax net in operating revenues on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 10 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Below is a listing of performance obligations that arise from contracts with customers, along with details on the satisfaction of each performance obligation, the significant payment terms and the nature of the goods and services being transferred, by reporting segment and other business operations: Revenue Recognized Over Time: Segment/ Operations Performance Obligation Description Natural Gas Distribution Natural gas utility sales NJNG's performance obligation is to provide natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers as demanded, based on regulated tariff rates, which are established by the BPU. Revenues from the sale of natural gas are recognized in the period that natural gas is delivered and consumed by customers, including an estimate for quantities consumed but not billed during the period. Payment is due each month for the previous month's deliveries. Natural gas sales to individual customers are based on meter readings, which are performed on a systematic basis throughout the billing period. The unbilled revenue estimates are based on estimated customer usage by customer type, weather effects and the most current tariff rates. NJNG is entitled to be compensated for performance completed until service is terminated. Customers may elect to purchase the natural gas commodity from NJNG or may contract separately to purchase natural gas directly from third-party suppliers. As NJNG is acting as an agent on behalf of the third-party supplier, revenue is recorded for the delivery of natural gas to the customer. Clean Energy Ventures Commercial solar electricity Clean Energy Ventures operates wholly-owned solar projects that recognize revenue as electricity is generated and transferred to the customer. The performance obligation is to provide electricity to the customer in accordance with contract terms or the interconnection agreement and is satisfied upon transfer of electricity generated. Revenue is recognized as invoiced and the payment is due each month for the previous month's services. Clean Energy Ventures Residential solar electricity Clean Energy Ventures provides access to residential rooftop and ground-mount solar equipment to customers who then pay the Company a monthly fee. The performance obligation is to provide electricity to the customer based on generation from the underlying residential solar asset and is satisfied upon transfer of electricity generated. Revenue is derived from the contract terms and is recognized as invoiced, with the payment due each month for the previous month's services. Clean Energy Ventures Renewable energy certificates Certain Clean Energy Ventures projects generate TRECs and SREC IIs under the established administratively determined incentive program. A TREC or SREC II is created for every MWh of electricity produced by a solar generator. The performance obligation of Clean Energy Ventures is to generate electricity. TRECs and SREC IIs under the administratively determined incentive program are purchased monthly by a REC Administrator. Revenue is recognized upon generation. Energy Services Natural gas services The performance obligation of Energy Services is to provide the customer transportation, storage and asset management services on an as-needed basis. Energy Services generates revenue through management fees, demand charges, reservation fees and transportation charges centered around the buying and selling of the natural gas commodity, representing one series of distinct performance obligations. Revenue is recognized based upon the underlying natural gas quantities physically delivered and the customer obtaining control. Energy Services invoices customers in line with the terms of the contract and based on the services provided. Payment is due upon receipt of the invoice. For temporary releases of pipeline capacity, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the agreed upon term. Storage and Transportation Natural gas services The performance obligation of Storage and Transportation is to provide the customer with storage and transportation services. Storage and Transportation generates revenues from firm storage contracts and transportation contracts, injection and withdrawal at the storage facility and the delivery of natural gas to customers. Revenue is recognized over time as customers receive the benefits of its service as it is performed on their behalf using an output method based on actual deliveries. Demand fees are recognized as revenue over the term of the related agreement. Home Services and Other Service contracts Home Services enters into service contracts with homeowners to provide maintenance and replacement services of applicable heating, cooling or ventilation equipment. NJR Retail enters into warranty contracts with homeowners for various appliances. All services provided relate to a distinct performance obligation which is to provide services for the specific equipment over the term of the contract. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and payment is due upon receipt of the invoice. 11 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue Recognized at a Point in Time: Segment/ Operations Performance Obligation Description Energy Services Natural gas services For a permanent release of pipeline capacity, the performance obligation of Energy Services is the release of the pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts and the transfer of the underlying contractual rights to the counterparty. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of the underlying contractual rights. Storage and Transportation Natural gas services The performance obligation of Storage and Transportation is to provide the customer with storage and transportation services. Storage and Transportation generates revenues from usage fees and hub services for the use of storage space, injection and withdrawal from the storage facility. Hub services include park and loan transactions and wheeling. Usage fees and hub services revenues are recognized as services are performed. Home Services and Other Installations Home Services installs appliances, including but not limited to, furnaces, air conditioning units, boilers and generators for customers. The distinct performance obligation is the installation of the contracted appliance, which is satisfied at the point in time the item is installed. The transaction price for each installation differs accordingly. Revenue is recognized at a point in time upon completion of the installation, which is when the customer is billed. Disaggregated revenues from contracts with customers by product line and by reporting segment and other business operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are as follows: (Thousands) Natural Gas Distribution Clean Energy Ventures

REGULATION NJNG is subject to cost-based regulation, therefore, it is permitted to recover authorized operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on its utility capital investments based on the BPU's approval. The impact of the ratemaking process and decisions authorized by the BPU allows NJNG to capitalize or defer certain costs that are expected to be recovered from its customers as regulatory assets and to recognize certain obligations representing amounts that are probable future expenditures as regulatory liabilities in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to regulated operations. NJNG's recovery of costs is facilitated through its base rates, BGSS and other regulatory tariff riders. NJNG is required to make filings to the BPU for review of its BGSS, CIP and other programs and related rates. Annual rate changes are typically requested to be effective at the beginning of the following fiscal year. The current base rates include a weighted average cost of capital of
6.84
percent and a return on common equity of
9.6
percent. All rate and program changes are subject to proper notification and BPU review and approval. In addition, NJNG is permitted to implement certain BGSS rate changes on a provisional basis with proper notification to the BPU. Regulatory assets and liabilities included on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for NJNG are comprised of the following: (Thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Regulatory assets-current New Jersey Clean Energy Program $ 14,090   $ 15,697   Conservation Incentive Program 19,633   23,099   Derivatives at fair value, net 26,314   —   Other current regulatory assets 1,318   1,290   Total current regulatory assets $ 61,355   $ 40,086   Regulatory assets-noncurrent Environmental remediation costs: Expended, net of recoveries $ 65,671   $ 66,149   Liability for future expenditures 125,727   127,070   Deferred income taxes 40,732   40,520   SAVEGREEN 54,909   52,690   Postemployment and other benefit costs 55,972   56,021   Deferred storm damage costs 1,629   2,172   Cost of removal 106,645   104,850   Other noncurrent regulatory assets 39,249   45,828   Total noncurrent regulatory assets $ 490,534   $ 495,300   Regulatory liability-current Overrecovered natural gas costs $ 42,245   $ 17,807   Derivatives at fair value, net 681   7,972   Total current regulatory liabilities $ 42,926   $ 25,779   Regulatory liabilities-noncurrent Tax Act impact

million and $ 6.9
million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, primarily related to a portion of bad debt associated with customer accounts receivable resulting from the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These costs are eligible for future regulatory recovery. On January 5, 2023, NJNG advised the BPU that it will cease deferring COVID-19 costs as of December 31, 2022, and will seek recovery of its regulatory asset balance in its next base rate proceeding. 14 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company is subject primarily to commodity price risk due to fluctuations in the market price of natural gas, SRECs and electricity. To manage this risk, the Company enters into a variety of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, futures contracts, physical forward contracts, financial options and swaps to economically hedge the commodity price risk associated with its existing and anticipated commitments to purchase and sell natural gas, SRECs and electricity. In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risk and may utilize foreign currency derivatives to hedge Canadian dollar denominated natural gas purchases and/or sales and interest rate derivatives to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. All of these types of contracts are accounted for as derivatives, unless the Company elects NPNS, which is done on a contract-by-contract election. Accordingly, all of the financial and certain of the Company's physical derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For a more detailed discussion of the Company’s fair value measurement policies and level disclosures associated with the Company’s derivative instruments, see
Note 6. Fair Value . Energy Services Energy Services chooses not to designate its financial commodity and physical forward commodity derivatives as accounting hedges or to elect NPNS. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as a component of natural gas purchases or operating revenues, as appropriate for Energy Services, on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as unrealized gains or losses. For Energy Services at settlement, realized gains and losses on all financial derivative instruments are recognized as a component of natural gas purchases and realized gains and losses on all physical derivatives follow the presentation of the related unrealized gains and losses as a component of either natural gas purchases or operating revenues. Energy Services also enters into natural gas transactions in Canada and, consequently, is exposed to fluctuations in the value of Canadian currency relative to the U.S. dollar. Energy Services may utilize foreign currency derivatives to lock in the exchange rates associated with natural gas transactions denominated in Canadian currency. The derivatives may include currency forwards, futures, or swaps and are accounted for as derivatives. These derivatives are typically used to hedge demand fee payments on pipeline capacity, storage and natural gas purchase agreements. As a result of Energy Services entering into transactions to borrow natural gas, commonly referred to as “park and loans,” an embedded derivative is recognized relating to differences between the fair value of the amount borrowed and the fair value of the amount that will ultimately be repaid, based on changes in the forward price for natural gas prices at the borrowed location over the contract term. This embedded derivative is accounted for as a forward sale in the month in which the repayment of the borrowed natural gas is expected to occur, and is considered a derivative transaction that is recorded at fair value on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in value recognized in current period earnings. Expected production of SRECs is hedged through the use of forward and futures contracts. All contracts require the Company to physically deliver SRECs through the transfer of certificates as per contractual settlement schedules. Energy Services recognizes changes in the fair value of these derivatives as a component of operating revenues. Upon settlement of the contract, the related revenue is recognized when the SREC is transferred to the counterparty. 15 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Natural Gas Distribution Changes in fair value of NJNG's financial commodity derivatives are recorded as a component of regulatory assets or liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company elects NPNS accounting treatment on all physical commodity contracts that NJNG entered into on or before December 31, 2015, and accounts for these contracts on an accrual basis. Accordingly, physical natural gas purchases are recognized in regulatory assets or liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets when the contract settles and the natural gas is delivered. The average cost of natural gas is charged to expense in the current period earnings based on the BGSS factor times the therm sales. Effective for contracts executed on or after January 1, 2016, NJNG no longer elects NPNS accounting treatment on a portfolio basis. However, since NPNS is a contract-by-contract election, where it makes sense to do so, NJNG can and may elect to treat certain contracts as normal. Because NJNG recovers these amounts through future BGSS rates as increases or decreases to the cost of natural gas in NJNG’s tariff for natural gas service, the changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred as a component of regulatory assets or liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Clean Energy Ventures The Company elects NPNS accounting treatment on PPA contracts executed by Clean Energy Ventures that meet the definition of a derivative and accounts for the contract on an accrual basis. Accordingly, electricity sales are recognized in revenues throughout the term of the PPA as electricity is delivered. NPNS is a contract-by-contract election and where it makes sense to do so, the Company can and may elect to treat certain contracts as normal.

Offsetting of Derivatives The Company transacts under master netting arrangements or equivalent agreements that allow it to offset derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty. However, the Company’s policy is to present its derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis at the contract level unit of account on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Energy Services utilizes financial derivatives to economically hedge the gross margin associated with the purchase of physical natural gas to be used for storage injection and its subsequent sale at a later date. The gains or (losses) on the financial transactions that are economic hedges of the cost of the purchased natural gas are recognized prior to the gains or (losses) on the physical transaction, which are recognized in earnings when the natural gas is delivered. Therefore, mismatches between the timing of the recognition of realized gains or (losses) on the financial derivative instruments and gains or (losses) associated with the actual sale of the natural gas that is being economically hedged along with fair value changes in derivative instruments, creates volatility in the results of Energy Services, although the Company's intended economic results relating to the entire transaction are unaffected. The following table presents the effect of derivative instruments recognized on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods set forth below: (Thousands) Location of gain (loss) recognized in income on derivatives Amount of gain (loss) recognized in income on derivatives Three Months Ended December 31, Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: 2022 2021 Energy Services: Physical commodity contracts Operating revenues $ 10,038   $ 150   Physical commodity contracts Natural gas purchases ( 670 ) 1,505   Financial commodity contracts Natural gas purchases 41,611   61,189   Total unrealized and realized loss $ 50,979   $ 62,844   NJNG’s derivative contracts are part of the Company's risk management activities that relate to its natural gas purchases and BGSS incentive programs. At settlement, the resulting gains and/or losses are payable to or recoverable from utility customers and are deferred in regulatory assets or liabilities resulting in no impact to earnings.

Broker Margin Futures exchanges have contract specific margin requirements that require the posting of cash or cash equivalents relating to traded contracts. Margin requirements consist of initial margin that is posted upon the initiation of a position, maintenance margin that is usually expressed as a percent of initial margin, and variation margin that fluctuates based on the daily marked-to-market relative to maintenance margin requirements. The Company maintains separate broker margin accounts for Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services.
The balances by reporting segment are as follows: (Thousands) Balance Sheet Location December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Natural Gas Distribution Restricted broker margin accounts-current assets $ 23,846   $ 26,138   Energy Services Restricted broker margin accounts-current assets $ 69,327   $ 68,123   Restricted broker margin accounts-current liabilities $ 7,297   $ —   Wholesale Credit Risk NJNG, Energy Services, Clean Energy Ventures and Storage and Transportation are exposed to credit risk as a result of their sales/wholesale marketing activities. As a result of the inherent volatility in the prices of natural gas commodities, derivatives and SRECs, the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties. If a counterparty fails to perform the obligations under its contract then the Company could sustain a loss. The Company monitors and manages the credit risk of its wholesale operations through credit policies and procedures that management believes reduce overall credit risk. These policies include a review and evaluation of current and prospective counterparties' financial statements and/or credit ratings, daily monitoring of counterparties' credit limits and exposure, daily communication with traders regarding credit status and the use of credit mitigation measures, such as collateral requirements and netting agreements. Examples of collateral include letters of credit and cash received for either prepayment or margin deposit. Collateral may be requested due to the Company's election not to extend credit or because exposure exceeds defined thresholds. Most of the Company's wholesale marketing contracts contain standard netting provisions. These contracts include those governed by ISDA and the NAESB. The netting provisions refer to payment netting, whereby receivables and payables with the same counterparty are offset and the resulting net amount is paid to the party to which it is due. Internally-rated exposure applies to counterparties that are not rated by Fitch or Moody's. In these cases, the counterparty's or guarantor's financial statements are reviewed, and similar methodologies and ratios used by Fitch and/or Moody's are applied to arrive at a substitute rating. Gross credit exposure is defined as the unrealized fair value of physical and financial derivative commodity contracts, plus any outstanding wholesale receivable for the value of natural gas delivered and/or financial derivative commodity contract that has settled for which payment has not yet been received. 19 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following is a summary of gross credit exposures grouped by investment and noninvestment grade counterparties, as of December 31, 2022. The amounts presented below have not been reduced by any collateral received or netting and exclude accounts receivable for NJNG retail natural gas sales and services and Clean Energy Ventures residential solar installations. (Thousands) Gross Credit Exposure Investment grade $ 263,489   Noninvestment grade 75,575   Internally rated investment grade 34,871   Internally rated noninvestment grade 46,725   Total $ 420,660   Conversely, certain of NJNG's and Energy Services' derivative instruments are linked to agreements containing provisions that would require cash collateral payments from the Company if certain events occur. These provisions vary based upon the terms in individual counterparty agreements and can result in cash payments if NJNG's credit rating were to fall below its current level. Specifically, most, but not all, of these additional payments will be triggered if NJNG's debt is downgraded by the major credit agencies, regardless of investment grade status. In addition, some of these agreements include threshold amounts that would result in additional collateral payments if the values of derivative liabilities were to exceed the maximum values provided for in relevant counterparty agreements. Other provisions include payment features that are not specifically linked to ratings but are based on certain financial metrics. Collateral amounts associated with any of these conditions are determined based on a sliding scale and are contingent upon the degree to which the Company's credit rating and/or financial metrics deteriorate, and the extent to which liability amounts exceed applicable threshold limits. There was approximately $ 258,000
of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position for which collateral is required as of December 31, 2022. These amounts differ from the respective net derivative liabilities reflected on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets because the agreements also include clauses, commonly known as “Rights of Offset,” that would permit the Company to offset its derivative assets against its derivative liabilities for determining additional collateral to be posted, as previously discussed. 6.
FAIR VALUE Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, current loan receivables, accounts payable, commercial paper and borrowings under revolving credit facilities are estimated to equal their carrying amounts due to the short maturity of those instruments. Non-current loans receivable are recorded based on what the Company expects to receive, which approximates fair value, in other noncurrent assets on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company regularly evaluates the credit quality and collection profile of its customers to approximate fair value. The estimated fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, excluding finance leases, debt issuance costs and solar asset financing obligations, is as follows: (Thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Carrying value

million and $ 9.5
million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. (3) Excludes NJR's debt issuance costs of $ 4.2
million and $ 3.8
million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Clean Energy Ventures enters into transactions to sell certain commercial solar assets and lease the assets back for a term specified in the lease. These transactions are considered financing obligations for accounting purposes and are recorded within long-term debt on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of solar asset financing obligations as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 was $ 154.9
million and $ 124.1
million, respectively. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of its debt. Inputs include observable municipal and corporate yields, as appropriate for the maturity of the specific issue and the Company's credit rating. As of December 31, 2022, the Company discloses its debt within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 20 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Fair Value Hierarchy The Company applies fair value measurement guidance to its financial assets and liabilities, as appropriate, which include financial derivatives and physical commodity contracts qualifying as derivatives, investments in equity securities and other financial assets and liabilities. In addition, authoritative accounting literature prescribes the use of a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on the source of the data used to develop the price inputs. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to inputs that are based on unobservable market data and includes the following: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The Company's Level 1 assets and liabilities include exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts, listed equities and money market funds. Exchange traded futures and options contracts include all energy contracts traded on the NYMEX, CME and ICE that the Company refers to internally as basis swaps, fixed swaps, futures and financial options that are cleared through an FCM. Level 2 Other significant observable inputs such as interest rates or price data, including both commodity and basis pricing that is observed either directly or indirectly from publications or pricing services. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include over-the-counter physical forward commodity contracts and swap contracts, SREC forward sales or derivatives that are initially valued using observable quotes and are subsequently adjusted to include time value, credit risk or estimated transport pricing components for which no basis price is available. Level 2 financial derivatives consist of transactions with non-FCM counterparties (basis swaps, fixed swaps and/or options). Inputs are verifiable and do not require significant management judgment. For some physical commodity contracts the Company utilizes transportation tariff rates that are publicly available and that it considers to be observable inputs that are equivalent to market data received from an independent source. There are no significant judgments or adjustments applied to the transportation tariff inputs and no market perspective is required. Even if the transportation tariff input were considered to be a “model,” it would still be considered to be a Level 2 input as the data is: • widely accepted and public; • non-proprietary and sourced from an independent third party; and • observable and published. These additional adjustments are generally not considered to be significant to the ultimate recognized values. Level 3 Inputs derived from a significant amount of unobservable market data. These include the Company's best estimate of fair value and are derived primarily through the use of internal valuation methodologies. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (Thousands) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total As of December 31, 2022: Assets: Physical commodity contracts $ —   $ 8,605   $ —   $ 8,605   Financial commodity contracts 39,518   —   —   39,518   Money market funds 82   —   —   82   Other 2,720   —   —   2,720   Total assets at fair value $ 42,320   $ 8,605   $ —   $ 50,925   Liabilities: Physical commodity contracts $ —   $ 29,932   $ —   $ 29,932   Financial commodity contracts 41,649   —   —   41,649   Total liabilities at fair value $ 41,649   $ 29,932   $ —   $ 71,581

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES Steckman Ridge The Company holds a
50
percent equity method investment in Steckman Ridge, a jointly owned and controlled natural gas storage facility located in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. The Company's investment in Steckman Ridge was $ 106.2
million and $ 106.6
million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, which include loans with a total outstanding principal balance of $ 70.4
million for both December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. These loans accrue interest at a variable rate that resets quarterly and are due October 1, 2023. NJNG and Energy Services have entered into storage and park and loan agreements with Steckman Ridge. See
Note 15. Related Party Transactions
for more information on these intercompany transactions. PennEast The Company, through its subsidiary NJR Midstream Company, is a
20
percent investor in PennEast, a partnership whose purpose was to construct and operate a
120 -mile natural gas pipeline that would have extended from northeast Pennsylvania to western New Jersey. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $ 92.0
million, or approximately $ 74.5
million, net of income taxes, which represented the best estimate of the salvage value of the remaining assets of the project and was recorded in equity in earnings of affiliates in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In September 2021, the PennEast partnership determined that this project was no longer supported, and all further development ceased. In March 2022, the PennEast board of managers approved cash distributions to members of the partnership following the sale of certain project-related assets and refunds of interconnection fees received from interstate pipelines. The return of capital received by the Company from March 2022 through September 2022, totaled $ 11.0
million and reduced the remaining carrying value of its equity method investment in PennEast to
zero
in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the excess recorded in equity in earnings of affiliates in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 22 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Long-term Debt NJR On October 24, 2022, NJR entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, which closed on December 15, 2022, under which NJR issued $ 50
million, Series 2022B senior notes at a fixed rate of
6.14
percent, maturing in 2032. The senior notes are unsecured and guaranteed by certain unregulated subsidiaries of NJR. NJNG On October 24, 2022, NJNG entered into a Note Purchase Agreement for $ 125
million of its senior notes at an interest rate of
5.47
percent, maturing in 2052. NJNG received $ 8.4
million and $ 17.3
million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in connection with the sale leaseback of its natural gas meters. NJNG records a financing lease obligation that is paid over the term of the lease and has the option to purchase the meters back at fair value upon expiration of the lease. NJNG exercised an early purchase option with respect to meter leases by making a final principal payment of $ 1.1
million during the three months ended December 31, 2021. There was
no
early purchase option exercised during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Clean Energy Ventures Clean Energy Ventures enters into transactions to sell the commercial solar assets concurrent with agreements to lease the assets back over a period of
five
to
15
years. These transactions are treated as financing obligations for accounting purposes and are typically secured by the renewable energy facility asset and its future cash flows from SRECs, TRECs and energy sales. ITCs and other tax benefits associated with these solar projects are transferred to the buyer, if applicable; however, the lease payments are structured so that Clean Energy Ventures is compensated for the transfer of the related tax incentives. Clean Energy Ventures continues to operate the solar assets, including related expenses, and retain the revenue generated from SRECs, TRECs and energy sales, and has the option to renew the lease or repurchase the assets sold at the end of the lease term. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Clean Energy Ventures received proceeds of $ 33.2
million and $ 3.3
million, respectively, in connection with the sale leaseback of commercial solar assets. The proceeds received were recognized as a financing obligation on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition, as in the past, the Company may elect to make contributions in excess of the minimum required amount to the plans. There were
no
discretionary contributions made during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There are no federal requirements to pre-fund OPEB benefits. However, the Company is required to fund certain amounts due to regulatory agreements with the BPU and estimates that it will contribute between $ 5
million and $ 10
million over each of the next five years. Additional contributions may be required based on market conditions and changes to assumptions. 24 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCOME TAXES ASC Topic 740,
Income Taxes
requires the use of an estimated annual effective tax rate for purposes of determining the income tax provision during interim reporting periods. In calculating its estimated annual effective tax rate, the Company considers forecasted annual pre-tax income and estimated permanent book versus tax differences. Adjustments to the effective tax rate and management's estimates will occur as information and assumptions change. Changes in tax laws or tax rates are recognized in the financial reporting period that includes the enactment date, the date in which the act is signed into law. NJR evaluates its tax positions to determine the appropriate accounting and recognition of potential future obligations associated with uncertain tax positions. A tax benefit claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a tax return may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position will be upheld upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recognized within income tax expense, and accrued interest and penalties are recognized within other noncurrent liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective Tax Rate The estimated annual effective tax rates were
22.5
percent and
21.6
percent, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. To the extent there are discrete tax items that are not included in the estimated annual effective tax rate, the actual reported effective tax rate may differ from the estimated annual effective tax rate. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, discrete items totaled approximately $( 554,000 ) and $ 166,000 , respectively, related to excess tax (benefit) provision associated with the vesting of share-based awards. NJR’s actual reported effective tax rate was
22.2
percent and
21.7
percent during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Inflation Reduction Act On August 16, 2022, the President of the U.S. signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains provisions addressing inflation, clean energy, healthcare and taxes beginning in 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act imposes a 15 percent minimum tax rate on corporations with higher than $1 billion of annual income, along with a 1 percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The Inflation Reduction Act raised the ITC from 26 percent to 30 percent through the end of 2032, dropping to 26 percent for property under construction before the end of 2033 and to 22 percent for property under construction before the end of 2034. The ITC expires starting in 2035 unless it is renewed. There are additional opportunities to increase the credit amount for certain facilities that are placed in service after December 31, 2022. The credit amount can be increased by 10 percent if certain domestic content requirements are satisfied or if the facility is located in an energy community, such as a brownfield site. ITCs are also expanded to include stand-alone energy storage projects without being integrated into a solar facility, allowing solar to claim PTCs that are a production-based credit extending for 10 years following the placed-in-service date of the facility and introduced the concept of transferability of tax credits, providing an additional option to monetize such credits. The Company evaluated the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, noting the corporate alternative minimum tax does not impact the Company as the applicable income thresholds have not been met. Upon the repurchase of common stock through the Company’s share repurchase program, the Company would be subject to the 1 percent excise tax. It is expected the ITC revisions of the Inflation Reduction Act could result in potential opportunities, however the Company cannot reasonably estimate the future impacts at this time. Other Tax Items As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company has tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 177.8
million and $ 211.8
million, respectively, which each have a life of
20
years. The Company expects to utilize this entire carryforward prior to expiration, which would begin in fiscal 2035. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company has state income tax net operating losses of approximately $ 515.1
million and $ 544.4
million, respectively. These state net operating losses have varying carry-forward periods dictated by the state in which they were incurred; these state carry-forward periods range from
seven
to
20
years, with the majority expiring after 2035. The Company expects to utilize this entire carryforward, other than as described below. 25 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
The impairment of the equity method investment in PennEast created net capital loss attributes, which can only be utilized to offset capital gains income and can be carried back three years and forward five years prior to expiration. These attributes totaled approximately $ 56.6
million as of both December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a valuation allowance totaling $ 21.9
million comprised of approximately $ 16.9
million, related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards and approximately $ 5.1
million related to capital loss carryforwards resulting from the impairment of the equity method investment in PennEast, which the Company believes are not more likely than not to be fully utilized prior to expiration. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance totaling $ 22.2
million comprised of approximately $ 17.2
million, related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards, which primarily relate to New Jersey and approximately $ 5.1
million related to capital loss carryforwards resulting from the impairment of the equity method investment in PennEast. The Consolidated Appropriations Act extended the 30 percent ITC for solar property that is under construction on or before December 31, 2019. Projects placed in service after December 31, 2019, may also qualify for a 30 percent federal ITC if five percent or more of the total costs of a solar property are incurred before the end of the applicable year and there are continuous efforts to advance towards completion of the project, based on the Internal Revenue Service guidance around ITC safe harbor determination. The credit declined to
26
percent for property under construction before the end of 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 extended the
26
percent tax credit for property under construction during 2021 and 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act raised the ITC from 26 percent to 30 percent through the end of 2032, as previously stated. 12.
LEASES
Lessee Accounting The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception based on whether the Company has the right to control the use of an identified asset, the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset. After the criteria is satisfied, the Company accounts for these arrangements as leases in accordance with ASC 842,
Leases . Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, including payments at commencement that depend on an index or rate. Most leases in which the Company is the lessee do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, so an incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at the lease commencement date, is utilized to determine the present value of lease payments. When a secured borrowing rate is not readily available, unsecured borrowing rates are adjusted for the effects of collateral to determine the incremental borrowing rate. The Company uses the implicit rate for agreements in which it is a lessor. The Company has not entered into any material agreements in which it is a lessor. Lease expense and lease income are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases. The Company’s lease agreements primarily consist of commercial solar land leases, storage and capacity leases, equipment and real property, including land and office facilities, office equipment and the sale leaseback of its natural gas meters. Certain leases contain escalation provisions for inflation metrics. The storage leases contain a variable payment component that relates to the change in the inflation metrics that are not known past the current payment period. The variable components of these lease payments are excluded from the lease payments that are used to determine the related right-of-use lease asset and liability. The variable portion of these leases are recognized as leasing expenses when they are incurred. The capacity lease payments are fully variable and based on the amount of natural gas stored in the storage caverns. Generally, the Company’s solar land lease terms are between
20
and
50
years and may include multiple options to extend the terms for an additional
five
to
20
years. The Company’s office leases vary in duration, ranging from
two
to
17
years and may or may not include extension or early purchase options. The Company’s meter lease terms are between
seven
and
ten years
with purchase options available prior to the end of the term. Equipment leases include general office equipment that also vary in duration, with an average term of
eight years . The Company's storage and capacity leases have assumed terms of
50
years to coincide with the expected useful lives of the cavern assets with which the leases are associated. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend, purchase the leased asset or terminate a lease and they are included in the lease liability calculation when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised. The Company has elected an accounting policy that exempts leases with an original term of one year or less from the recognition requirements of ASC 842,
Leases . 26 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for certain classes of leases, such as office buildings, solar land leases and office equipment. Variable payments are not considered material to the Company. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictions or material covenants. In July 2021, NJNG entered into
16-year
lease agreements, as Lessor, with various NJR subsidiaries, as Lessees, for office space at the Company’s headquarters in Wall, New Jersey, the effects of which are eliminated in consolidation.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Cash Commitments NJNG has entered into long-term contracts, expiring at various dates through September 2039, for the supply, transportation and storage of natural gas. These contracts include annual fixed charges of approximately $ 191.4
million at current contract rates and volumes for the remainder of the fiscal year, which are recoverable through BGSS. For the purpose of securing storage and pipeline capacity, Energy Services enters into storage and pipeline capacity contracts, which require the payment of certain demand charges by Energy Services to maintain the ability to access such natural gas storage or pipeline capacity, during a fixed time period, which generally ranges from
one
to
10
years. Demand charges are established by interstate storage and pipeline operators and are regulated by FERC. These demand charges represent commitments to pay storage providers or pipeline companies for the right to store and/or transport natural gas utilizing their respective assets. Commitments as of December 31, 2022, for natural gas purchases and future demand fees for the next five fiscal year periods are as follows: (Thousands) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Energy Services: Natural gas purchases $ 91,458   $ 1,888   $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   Storage demand fees 15,844   14,434   8,278   4,714   2,207   818   Pipeline demand fees 41,076   43,235   32,380   32,280   23,087   20,717   Sub-total Energy Services $ 148,378   $ 59,557   $ 40,658   $ 36,994   $ 25,294   $ 21,535   NJNG: Natural gas purchases $ 9,152   $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   Storage demand fees 32,951   33,815   16,848   10,164   9,541   4,772   Pipeline demand fees 110,006   142,093   140,934   127,564   124,160   1,057,937   Sub-total NJNG $ 152,109   $ 175,908   $ 157,782   $ 137,728   $ 133,701   $ 1,062,709   Total $ 300,487   $ 235,465   $ 198,440   $ 174,722   $ 158,995   $ 1,084,244   Certain pipeline demand fees totaling approximately $ 4.0  million per year, for which Energy Services is the responsible party, are being paid for by the counterparty to a capacity release transaction beginning November 1, 2021 for a period of 10 years. 28 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Legal Proceedings Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation NJNG is responsible for the remedial cleanup of certain former MGP sites, dating back to gas operations in the late 1800s and early 1900s, which contain contaminated residues from former gas manufacturing operations. NJNG is currently involved in administrative proceedings with the NJDEP and participating in various studies and investigations by outside consultants, to determine the nature and extent of any such contaminated residues and to develop appropriate programs of remedial action, where warranted, under NJDEP regulations. NJNG periodically, and at least annually, performs an environmental review of former MGP sites located in Atlantic Highlands, Berkeley, Long Branch, Manchester, Toms River, Freehold and Aberdeen, New Jersey, including a review of potential liability for investigation and remedial action. NJNG estimates the total future expenditures at the former MGP sites for which it is responsible, including potential liabilities for natural resource damages that might be brought by the NJDEP for alleged injury to groundwater or other natural resources concerning these sites will range from approximately $ 110.8
million to $ 167.1
million. NJNG’s estimate of these liabilities is based upon known facts, existing technology and enacted laws and regulations in place when the review was completed. Where it is probable that costs will be incurred, and the information is sufficient to establish a range of possible liability, NJNG accrues the most likely amount in the range. If no point within the range is more likely than the other, it is NJNG’s policy to accrue the lower end of the range. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, NJNG recorded a MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of approximately $ 125.7
million on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the most likely amount. The actual costs to be incurred by NJNG are dependent upon several factors, including final determination of remedial action, changing technologies and governmental regulations, the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay and insurance recoveries, if any. In June 2019, NJNG initiated a preliminary assessment of a site in Aberdeen, New Jersey to determine prior ownership and if former MGP operations were active at the location. The preliminary assessment and site investigation activities are ongoing at the Aberdeen, New Jersey site location. The estimated costs to complete the preliminary assessment and site investigation phase are included in the MGP remediation liability and corresponding regulatory asset on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. NJNG will continue to gather information to determine whether the obligation exists to undertake remedial action, if any, and refine its estimate of potential costs for this site as more information becomes available. NJNG recovers its remediation expenditures, including carrying costs, over rolling
seven-year
periods pursuant to a RAC approved by the BPU. On March 23, 2022, the BPU approved an increase in the RAC, which increased the pre-tax annual recovery from $ 11.1  million to $ 11.7  million, effective April 1, 2022. On September 13, 2022, NJNG submitted its annual filing to the BPU requesting approval of RAC expenditures through June 30, 2022, as well as an increase to the RAC annual recoveries of $ 3.8  million, which will increase the pre-tax annual recovery to $ 15.5  million, effective April 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, $ 65.7
million of previously incurred remediation costs, net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds, are included in regulatory assets on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NJNG will continue to seek recovery of MGP-related costs through the RAC. If any future regulatory position indicates that the recovery of such costs is not probable, the related non-recoverable costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination. General The Company is involved, and from time to time in the future may be involved, in a number of pending and threatened judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings relating to matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation matters, particularly when such matters are in their early stages or where the claimants seek indeterminate damages, the Company cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of the pending litigation will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter will be, if any. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes accruals for litigation for those matters that present loss contingencies as to which it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses contingent matters for which there is a reasonable possibility of a loss. Based upon currently available information, the Company believes that the results of litigation that are currently pending, taken together, will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The actual results of resolving the pending litigation matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued. The foregoing statements about the Company’s litigation are based upon the Company’s judgments, assumptions and estimates and are necessarily subjective and uncertain. The Company has a number of threatened and pending litigation matters at various stages. 29 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company's assets for the various reporting segments and business operations are detailed below: (Thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Assets at end of period: Natural Gas Distribution $ 4,226,035   $ 4,030,686   Clean Energy Ventures 1,047,726   1,015,065   Energy Services 446,017   333,064   Storage and Transportation 1,009,567   999,520   Subtotal 6,729,345   6,378,335   Home Services and Other 145,887   159,068   Intercompany assets
(1) ( 265,138 ) ( 275,987 ) Total $ 6,610,094   $ 6,261,416   (1) Consists of transactions between subsidiaries that are eliminated and reclassified in consolidation. The Chief Executive Officer, who uses NFE as a measure of profit or loss in measuring the results of the Company's reporting segments and operations, is the chief operating decision maker of the Company.
A reconciliation of consolidated NFE to consolidated net income is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Net financial earnings $ 110,284   $ 65,770   Less: Unrealized (gain) on derivative instruments and related transactions ( 31,503 ) ( 82,191 ) Tax effect 7,487   19,536   Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory 23,972   23,577   Tax effect ( 5,697 ) ( 5,603 ) NFE tax adjustment 104   ( 861 ) Net income $ 115,921   $ 111,312   The Company uses derivative instruments as economic hedges of purchases and sales of physical natural gas inventory. For GAAP purposes, these derivatives are recorded at fair value and related changes in fair value are included in reported earnings. Revenues and cost of natural gas related to physical natural gas flow are recognized when the natural gas is delivered to customers. Consequently, there is a mismatch in the timing of earnings recognition between the economic hedges and physical natural gas flows. Timing differences occur in two ways: • unrealized gains and losses on derivatives are recognized in reported earnings in periods prior to physical natural gas inventory flows; and • unrealized gains and losses of prior periods are reclassified as realized gains and losses when derivatives are settled in the same period as physical natural gas inventory movements occur. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating these timing differences, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of natural gas, SRECs and foreign currency contracts. Consequently, to reconcile between net income and NFE, current period unrealized gains and losses on the derivatives are excluded from NFE as a reconciling item. Realized derivative gains and losses are also included in current period net income. However, NFE includes only realized gains and losses related to natural gas sold out of inventory, effectively matching the full earnings effects of the derivatives with realized margins on physical natural gas flows. Included in the tax effects are current and deferred income tax expense corresponding with the components of NFE. The Company also calculates a quarterly tax adjustment based on an estimated annual effective tax rate for NFE purposes. 32 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reporting Segments We have four primary reporting segments as presented in the chart below: In addition to our four reporting segments above, we have nonutility operations that either provide corporate support services or do not meet the criteria to be treated as a separate reporting segment. These operations, which comprise Home Services and Other, include: appliance repair services, sales and installations at NJRHS, commercial real estate holdings at Commercial Realty & Resources Corp. and home warranty contracts at NJR Retail. 34 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic We continue to closely monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and have, when appropriate, taken steps intended to limit potential exposure for our employees and those we serve, including continuity in the safe operation of our business. These steps include working from home for our office-based employees utilizing a hybrid schedule and limiting direct contact with our customers. And while we, along with other businesses, are continuing to return to normal operating practices, this remains an evolving situation. The timing for recovery of businesses and local economies, resurgences or mutations of the virus, and any potential future shutdowns remains unknown. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to provide essential services to our customers. Both NJR and NJNG continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet their current obligations and business operations remain fundamentally unchanged at this time. We cannot predict the nature and extent of the pandemic's impacts to future operations, or its effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We will continue to monitor developments affecting our employees, customers, and operations and take additional steps to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts, as necessary. Operating Results Net income (loss) by reporting segment and other business operations are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Net income (loss) Natural Gas Distribution $ 54,664   47   % $ 51,080  46  % Clean Energy Ventures (3,582) (3) (6,821) (6) Energy Services 64,561   56   65,744  59  Storage and Transportation 6,243   5   2,962  3  Home Services and Other (29) —   447  —  Eliminations

The increase in net income during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, was due primarily to increased earnings at Natural Gas Distribution due primarily to increased base rates and BGSS incentives along with Storage and Transportation due to Adelphia Gateway becoming fully operational in September 2022. Assets by reporting segment and operations are as follows: (Thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Assets Natural Gas Distribution $ 4,226,035   64   % $ 4,030,686  64  % Clean Energy Ventures

The increase in assets was due primarily to additional investment in utility plant at Natural Gas Distribution and solar asset investments at Clean Energy Ventures along with increased accounts receivable at both Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our management uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating our operating results. Energy Services economically hedges its natural gas inventory with financial derivative instruments. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of natural gas and, therefore, eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              associated with the derivative instruments. To the extent we utilize forwards, futures, or other derivatives to hedge forecasted SREC production, unrealized gains and losses are also eliminated from NFE. Included in the tax effects are current and deferred income tax expense corresponding with the components of NFE. GAAP requires us, during the interim periods, to estimate our annual effective tax rate and use this rate to calculate the year-to-date tax provision. We also determine an annual estimated effective tax rate for NFE purposes and calculate a quarterly tax adjustment based on the differences between our forecasted net income and our forecasted NFE for the fiscal year. Since the annual estimated effective tax rate is based on certain forecasted assumptions, the rate and resulting NFE are subject to change. No adjustment is needed during the fourth quarter, since the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or a replacement of, the comparable GAAP measure and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NFE: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 Net income $ 115,921   $ 111,312  Add: Unrealized (gain) on derivative instruments and related transactions (31,503) (82,191) Tax effect 7,487   19,536  Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory

The increase in NFE during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, was due primarily to increased earnings at Energy Services, increased base rates and BGSS incentives at Natural Gas Distribution, along with Adelphia Gateway becoming fully operational, as previously discussed. 36 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Natural Gas Distribution Overview Natural Gas Distribution is comprised of NJNG, a natural gas utility that provides regulated natural gas service throughout Burlington, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, and Sussex counties in New Jersey to approximately 572,500 residential and commercial customers in its service territory and also participates in the off-system sales and capacity release markets. The business is subject to various risks, including those risks associated with COVID-19, which may include but are not limited to impacts to customer growth and customer usage, customer collections, the timing and costs of capital expenditures and construction of infrastructure projects, operating and financing costs, fluctuations in commodity prices and customer conservation efforts. In addition, NJNG may be subject to adverse economic conditions such as inflation and rising natural gas costs, certain regulatory actions, environmental remediation and severe weather conditions. It is often difficult to predict the impact of events or trends associated with these risks. NJNG’s business is seasonal by nature, as weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered to customers on an annual basis. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes. As a result, NJNG generates most of its natural gas distribution revenues during the first and second fiscal quarters and is subject to variations in earnings and working capital during the fiscal year. As a regulated company, NJNG is required to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements. See
Note 4. Regulation
in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion on regulatory actions, including filings related to programs and associated expenditures, as well as rate requests related to recovery of capital investments and operating costs. NJNG’s operations are managed with the goal of providing safe and reliable service, growing its customer base, diversifying its Utility Gross Margin, promoting clean energy programs and mitigating the risks discussed above. Base Rate Case On November 17, 2021, the BPU issued an order adopting a stipulation of settlement approving a $79.0 million increase to base rates, effective December 1, 2021. In addition, the order also included approval for the final increase for the NJ RISE/SAFE II programs, which totaled $269,000. These increases include an overall rate of return on rate base of 6.84 percent, return on common equity of 9.6 percent, a common equity ratio of 54.0 percent and a composite depreciation rate of 2.78 percent.
Infrastructure Projects NJNG has significant annual capital expenditures associated with the management of its natural gas distribution and transmission system, including new utility plant associated with customer growth and its associated pipeline integrity management and infrastructure programs. Below is a summary of NJNG’s capital expenditures, including accruals, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and estimates of expected investments for fiscal 2023 and 2024: 37 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Estimated capital expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory oversight, environmental regulations, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital. NJNG continues to implement BPU-approved infrastructure projects that are designed to enhance the reliability and integrity of NJNG’s natural gas distribution system. Infrastructure Investment Program In February 2019, NJNG filed a petition with the BPU seeking authority to implement a five-year IIP. The IIP consisted of two components: transmission and distribution investments and information technology replacement and enhancements. The total investment for the IIP was approximately $507.0 million. All approved investments will be recovered through annual filings to adjust base rates. In October 2020, the BPU approved the Company’s transmission and distribution component of the IIP for $150.0 million over five years, effective November 1, 2020. NJNG voluntarily withdrew the information technology upgrade component and will seek to recover associated costs in future rate case proceedings. On March 31, 2022, NJNG filed its first rate recovery request for its BPU approved IIP with capital expenditures estimated through June 30, 2022, including AFUDC. On July 13, 2022, NJNG filed its update with actual capital expenditures of $28.9 million through June 30, 2022. On September 7, 2022, the BPU approved the rate increase resulting in a $3.2 million revenue increase, effective October 1, 2022. Customer Growth In conducting NJNG's business, management focuses on factors it believes may have significant influence on its future financial results. NJNG's policy is to work with all stakeholders, including customers, regulators and policymakers, to achieve favorable results. These factors include the rate of NJNG's customer growth in its service territory, which can be influenced by political and regulatory policies, the delivered cost of natural gas compared with competing fuels, interest rates and general economic and business conditions. NJNG's total customers include the following: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Firm customers Residential 514,452   506,677  Commercial, industrial & other 32,302   31,756  Residential transport 17,386   19,338  Commercial transport 8,242   8,735  Total firm customers 572,382   566,506  Other 118   55  Total customers 572,500   566,561  During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, NJNG added 2,132 and 1,730 new customers, respectively. NJNG expects new customer additions, and those customers who added additional natural gas services to their premises to contribute approximately $1.8 million of incremental Utility Gross Margin on an annualized basis. NJNG expects its new customer annual growth rate to be approximately 1.6 percent. Based on information from municipalities and developers, as well as external industry analysts and management's experience, NJNG estimates that approximately 63 percent of the growth will come from new construction markets and 37 percent from customer conversions to natural gas from other fuel sources. This new customer and conversion growth would increase Utility Gross Margin under NJNG's base rates by approximately $7.7 million annually, as calculated under NJNG's CIP tariff. Energy Efficiency Programs SAVEGREEN conducts home energy audits and provides various grants, incentives and financing alternatives designed to encourage the installation of high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment and other energy efficiency upgrades. Depending on the specific incentive or approval, NJNG recovers costs associated with the programs over a two- to 10-year period through a tariff rider mechanism. In March 2021, the BPU approved a three-year SAVEGREEN program consisting of approximately $126.1 million of direct investment, $109.4 million in financing options, and approximately $23.4 million in operation and maintenance expenses. 38 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              In June 2021, NJNG submitted its annual cost recovery filing for the SAVEGREEN programs established from 2010 through 2021. On January 26, 2022, the BPU approved the stipulation, which increased annual recoveries by $2.2 million, effective February 1, 2022. On June 1, 2022, NJNG submitted its annual cost recovery filing for the SAVEGREEN programs established from 2010 through the present. On September 28, 2022, the BPU approved the rate decrease, which resulted in an annual decrease of approximately $3.5 million, effective October 1, 2022. The following table summarizes, loans, grants, rebates and related investments as of: (Thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Loans $ 158,200   $ 152,000  Grants, rebates and related investments 136,700   132,200  Total $ 294,900   $ 284,200  Program recoveries from customers during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $2.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively. The recovery includes a weighted average cost of capital that ranges from 6.69 percent to 7.76 percent, with a return on equity of 9.6 percent to 10.3 percent. Conservation Incentive Program/BGSS The CIP facilitates normalizing NJNG’s Utility Gross Margin for variances not only due to weather but also for other factors affecting customer usage, such as conservation and energy efficiency. Recovery of Utility Gross Margin for the non-weather variance through the CIP is limited to the amount of certain natural gas supply cost savings achieved and is subject to a variable margin revenue test. Additionally, recovery of the CIP Utility Gross Margin is subject to an annual earnings test. An annual review of the CIP must be filed by June 1, coincident with NJNG’s annual BGSS filing, during which NJNG can request rate changes to the CIP. NJNG's total utility firm gross margin includes the following adjustments related to the CIP mechanism: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Weather
(1) $ 2,080   $ 15,934  Usage 1,486   (1,073) Total $ 3,566   $ 14,861  (1) Compared with the 20-year average, weather was 0.3 percent warmer-than-normal and 17.8 percent warmer-than-normal during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Recovery of Natural Gas Costs NJNG’s cost of natural gas is passed through to our customers, without markup, by applying NJNG’s authorized BGSS rate to actual therms delivered. There is no Utility Gross Margin associated with BGSS costs; therefore, changes in such costs do not impact NJNG’s earnings. NJNG monitors its actual natural gas costs in comparison to its BGSS rates to manage its cash flows associated with its allowed recovery of natural gas costs, which is facilitated through BPU-approved deferred accounting and the BGSS pricing mechanism. Accordingly, NJNG occasionally adjusts its periodic BGSS rates or can issue credits or refunds, as appropriate, for its residential and small commercial customers when the commodity cost varies from the existing BGSS rate. BGSS rates for its large commercial customers are adjusted monthly based on NYMEX prices. NJNG’s residential and commercial markets are currently open to competition, and its rates are segregated between BGSS (i.e., natural gas commodity) and delivery (i.e., transportation) components. NJNG earns Utility Gross Margin through the delivery of natural gas to its customers and, therefore, is not negatively affected by customers who use its transportation service and purchase natural gas from another supplier. Under an existing order from the BPU, BGSS can be provided by suppliers other than the state’s natural gas utilities; however, customers who purchase natural gas from another supplier continue to use NJNG for transportation service. 39 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              In May 2022, the BPU approved on a final basis a $2.9 million increase to the annual revenues credited to BGSS, a $13.0 million annual increase related to its balancing charge, as well as changes to CIP rates, which resulted in a $6.3 million annual recovery decrease, effective December 1, 2021. In November 2021, NJNG submitted notification of its intent to self-implement an increase to its BGSS rate, which resulted in an approximately $24.2 million increase to annual revenues credited to BGSS, effective December 1, 2021. In September 2022, the BPU approved on a preliminary basis NJNG annual petition to modify its BGSS, balancing charge and CIP rates for residential and small business customers. This included an $81.9 million increase to the annual revenues credited to BGSS, a $9.0 million annual increase related to its balancing charge and a $10.2 million increase to CIP rates, effective October 1, 2022. The balancing charge rate includes the cost of balancing natural gas deliveries with customer usage for sales and transportation customers, and balancing charge revenues are credited to BGSS. BGSS Incentive Programs NJNG is eligible to receive financial incentives for reducing BGSS costs through a series of Utility Gross Margin-sharing programs that include off-system sales, capacity release and storage incentive programs. These programs are designed to encourage better utilization and hedging of NJNG’s natural gas supply, transportation and storage assets. Depending on the program, NJNG shares 80 or 85 percent of Utility Gross Margin generated by these programs with firm customers. Utility Gross Margin from incentive programs was $8.7 million and $3.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Hedging In order to provide relative price stability to its natural gas supply portfolio, NJNG employs a hedging strategy with the goal of having at least 75 percent of the Company's projected winter periodic BGSS natural gas sales volumes hedged by each November 1 and at least 25 percent of the projected periodic BGSS natural gas sales hedged for the following April through March period. The hedging goal is typically achieved with gas in storage and the use of financial instruments to hedge storage injections. NJNG may also use various financial instruments including futures, swaps, options and weather related products to hedge its future delivery obligations. Commodity Prices Natural Gas Distribution is affected by the price of natural gas, which can have a significant impact on our cash flows, short-term financing costs, the price of natural gas charged to our customers through the BGSS clause, our ability to collect accounts receivable, which impacts our bad debt expense, and our ability to maintain a competitive advantage over other energy sources. Natural gas commodity prices are shown in the graph below, which illustrates the daily natural gas prices (1)

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Societal Benefits Charge NJNG’s qualifying customers are eligible for the USF program, which is administered by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, to help make energy bills more affordable. In March 2022, the BPU approved on a final basis NJNG's annual SBC application to recover remediation expenses, including an increase in the RAC, of approximately $600,000 annually and a decrease to the NJCEP factor of approximately $2.9 million, effective April 1, 2022. In June 2022, NJNG filed its annual USF compliance filing proposing a decrease to the statewide USF rate. In August 2022, an additional update was submitted on behalf of all NJ utilities with actual information through July 31, 2022. In September 2022, the BPU approved a decrease based on the August update, which resulted in an annual decrease of approximately $1.6 million, effective October 1, 2022. In September 2022, NJNG submitted its annual SBC filing to the BPU requesting approval of RAC expenditures through June 30, 2022, as well as an increase to the RAC annual recoveries of $3.8 million and an increase to the NJCEP annual recoveries of $2.2 million, with a proposed effective date of April 1, 2023. Environmental Remediation NJNG is responsible for the environmental remediation of former MGP sites, which contain contaminated residues from former gas manufacturing operations that ceased operating at these sites by the mid-1950s and, in some cases, had been discontinued many years earlier. Actual MGP remediation costs may vary from management’s estimates due to the developing nature of remediation requirements, regulatory decisions by the NJDEP and related litigation. NJNG reviews these costs at the end of each fiscal year and adjusts its liability and corresponding regulatory asset as necessary to reflect its expected future remediation obligation. Accordingly, NJNG recognized a regulatory asset and an obligation of $125.7 million as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $1.3 million compared with the prior fiscal period. In June 2019, NJNG initiated a preliminary assessment of a site in Aberdeen, New Jersey to determine prior ownership and if former MGP operations were active at the location. The preliminary assessment and site investigation activities are ongoing at the Aberdeen site and based on initial findings will be moving to the remedial investigation phase. The costs associated with preliminary assessment, site investigation and remedial investigation activities are considered immaterial and are included as a component of NJNG’s annual SBC application to recover remediation expenses. We will continue to gather information to further refine and enhance the estimate of potential costs for this site as it becomes available. See Note 13.

(2) Includes the purchased cost of the natural gas, fees paid to pipelines and storage facilities, adjustments as a result of BGSS incentive programs and hedging transactions. These expenses are passed through to customers and are offset by corresponding revenues. (3) Includes related party transactions of approximately $2.3 million for both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a portion of which is eliminated in consolidation. (4) Consists of expenses associated with state-mandated programs, the RAC and energy efficiency programs, and are calculated on a per-therm basis. These expenses are passed through to customers and are offset by corresponding revenues. Operating Revenues and Natural Gas Purchases Operating revenues increased by 30.2 percent and natural gas purchases increased 48.3 percent during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses Utility Gross Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating the operating results of NJNG. NJNG's Utility Gross Margin is defined as operating revenues less natural gas purchases, sales tax, and regulatory rider expenses. This measure differs from gross margin as presented on a GAAP basis as it excludes certain operations and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization. Utility Gross Margin may also not be comparable to the definition of gross margin used by others in the natural gas distribution business and other industries. Management believes that Utility Gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations since natural gas costs, sales tax and regulatory rider expenses are included in operating revenues and passed through to customers and, therefore, have no effect on Utility Gross Margin. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure. Utility Gross Margin A reconciliation of gross margin, the closest GAAP financial measure to NJNG's Utility Gross Margin, is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Operating revenues $ 357,746   $ 274,772  Less: Natural gas purchases 184,771   124,594  Operation and maintenance

Utility Gross Margin consists of three components: • Utility firm gross margin generated from only the delivery component of either a sales tariff or a transportation tariff from residential and commercial customers who receive natural gas service from NJNG; • BGSS incentive programs, where revenues generated or savings achieved from BPU-approved off-system sales, capacity release or storage incentive programs are shared between customers and NJNG; and • Utility Gross Margin generated from off-tariff customers, as well as interruptible customers. The following provides more information on the components of Utility Gross Margin and associated throughput (Bcf) of natural gas delivered to customers: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 ($ in thousands) Margin Bcf Margin Bcf Utility Gross Margin/Throughput Residential $ 104,018   14.7   $ 92,605  12.6  Commercial, industrial and other 20,779   2.7   19,102  2.3  Firm transportation 20,480   4.0   17,282  3.6  Total utility firm gross margin/throughput 145,277   21.4   128,989  18.5  BGSS incentive programs 8,686   17.9   3,764  25.1  Interruptible/off-tariff agreements 761   3.6   754  6.1  Total Utility Gross Margin/Throughput $ 154,724   42.9   $ 133,507  49.7  43 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Utility Firm Gross Margin Utility firm gross margin increased $16.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased base rates along with higher BGSS incentive and increased residential and transportation customers. The factors contributing to the change in Utility Gross Margin generated by BGSS incentive programs are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 v. 2021 Off-system sales $ 3,179   Storage 1,749   Capacity release (6) Total increase $ 4,922   The increase in BGSS incentive programs during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, was due primarily to increased margins from off-system sales and the acceleration of storage incentives. Operation and Maintenance Expense O&M expense increased $13.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to the deferral of $10.7 million in pandemic related costs in accordance with the July 2, 2020 BPU deferral order in December 2021 that did not reoccur. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense increased $2.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, as a result of additional utility plant being placed into service. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $2.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased outstanding long-term debt. Other Income Other income increased $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased AFUDC equity. Income Tax Provision Income tax provision increased $1.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to higher income before income taxes. Net Income Net income increased $3.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to higher Utility Gross Margin and increased other income, partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and interest expenses and higher income taxes as previously discussed. 44 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2.

Overview Clean Energy Ventures actively pursues opportunities in the renewable energy markets. Clean Energy Ventures enters into various agreements to install solar net-metered systems for residential and commercial customers, as well as large commercial grid-connected projects. In addition, Clean Energy Ventures enters into various long-term agreements, including PPAs, to supply energy from commercial solar projects. Capital expenditures related to clean energy projects are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may affect our ability to commence operations at these projects on a timely basis or at all, including logistics associated with the start-up of residential and commercial solar projects, such as timing of construction schedules, the permitting and regulatory process, any delays related to electric grid interconnection, economic trends, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital or allocation of capital to other investments or business opportunities. Clean Energy Ventures is also subject to various risks, including those associated with COVID-19, which may include impacts to residential solar customer growth and customer collections, our ability to identify and develop commercial solar asset investments, impacts to our supply chain and our ability to source materials for construction. The primary contributors toward the value of qualifying clean energy projects are tax incentives and RECs. Changes in the federal statutes related to the ITC and/or relevant state legislation and regulatory policies affecting the market for solar renewable energy credits, could significantly affect future results. Solar projects placed in service and related expenditures are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, ($ in Thousands) 2022 2021 Placed in service Projects MW Costs Projects MW Costs Grid-connected
(1) 1   7.5   $ 14,076   1  1.0  $ 3,120  Net-metered: Commercial 2   10.5   25,330   —  —  —  Sunlight Advantage® 45   0.6   1,840   53  0.6  1,553  Total placed in service 48   18.6   $ 41,246   54  1.6  $ 4,673  (1) Includes projects subject to sale leaseback arrangements. Clean Energy Ventures has approximately 405.2 MW of solar capacity in service. Projects that were placed in service through December 31, 2019, qualified for a 30 percent federal ITC. The credit declined to 26 percent for property under construction during 2020. In December 2020, the 26 percent federal ITC was extended through the end of 2022. Following the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act into law in August 2022, the federal ITC was restored to 30 percent through the end of 2032. There are additional opportunities to increase the credit amount up to 20 percent for certain facilities that are placed in service after December 31, 2022, based upon the type of project and location. ITC-eligible projects placed in service prior to the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act are not impacted by the change. Clean Energy Ventures may enter into transactions to sell certain of its commercial solar assets concurrent with agreements to lease the assets back over a period of five to 15 years. The Company will continue to operate the solar assets and are responsible for related expenses and entitled to retain the revenue generated from RECs and energy sales. The ITCs and other tax benefits associated with these solar projects transfer to the buyer if applicable; however, the lease payments are structured so that Clean Energy Ventures is compensated for the transfer of the related tax incentives. Accordingly, for solar projects financed under sale leasebacks for which the assets were sold during the first 5 years of in-service life, Clean Energy Ventures recognizes the equivalent value of the ITC in other income on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations over the respective five-year ITC recapture periods, starting with the second year of the lease. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Clean Energy Ventures received proceeds of $33.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in connection with the sale leaseback of commercial solar assets. 45 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              As part of its solar investment portfolio, Clean Energy Ventures operates a residential and small commercial solar program, The Sunlight Advantage®, that provides qualifying homeowners and small business owners the opportunity to have a solar system installed at their home or place of business with no installation or maintenance expenses. Clean Energy Ventures owns, operates and maintains the system over the life of the contract in exchange for monthly payments. For solar installations placed in-service in New Jersey prior to April 30, 2020, each MWh of electricity produced creates an SREC that represents the renewable energy attribute of the solar-electricity generated that can be sold to third parties, predominantly load-serving entities that are required to comply with the solar requirements under New Jersey's renewable portfolio standard. In December 2019, the BPU established the TREC as the successor program to the SREC program. TRECs provide a fixed compensation base multiplied by an assigned project factor in order to determine their value. The project factor is determined by the type and location of the project, as defined. All TRECs generated are required to be purchased monthly by a TREC program administrator as appointed by the BPU. In July 2021, the BPU established a new successor solar incentive program. This Administratively Determined Incentive Program, which we refer to as SREC IIs, provides administratively set incentives for net metered residential projects and net metered non-residential projects of 5 MW or less. REC activity consisted of the following: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 SRECs SREC IIs TRECs SRECs TRECs Inventory balance as of October 1, 116,005   247   10,759   108,104  6,944  RECs generated 98,462   1,784   8,345   92,172  6,085  RECs delivered (16,812) (919) (12,933) (12,200) (7,240) Inventory balance as of December 31, 197,655   1,112   6,171   188,076  5,789  The average SREC sales price was $231 and $235 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the average TREC price was $140 and $139 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the average SREC II price was $91 during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Clean Energy Ventures hedges its expected SREC production through the use of forward sales contracts. The following table reflects the hedged percentage of our projected inventory of SRECs related to its in-service commercial and residential assets: Energy Year
(1) Percent of SRECs Hedged 2023 95% 2024 98% 2025 89% 2026 31% 2027 17% (1) Energy years are compliance periods for New Jersey's renewable portfolio standard that run from June 1 to May 31. There are no direct costs associated with the production of RECs by our solar assets. All related costs are included as a component of O&M expenses on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, including such expenses as facility maintenance and broker fees. 46 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2.

Operation and Maintenance Expense O&M expense decreased $1.4 million during the three months ended, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to decreased project maintenance expenses. Net Loss Net loss decreased $3.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to the increased operating revenues and lower O&M, as previously discussed, partially offset by a lower income tax benefit related to a lower operating loss. Energy Services Overview Energy Services markets and sells natural gas to wholesale and retail customers and manages natural gas transportation and storage assets throughout major market areas across North America. Energy Services maintains a strategic portfolio of natural gas transportation and storage contracts that it utilizes in conjunction with its market expertise to provide service and value to its customers. Availability of these transportation and storage contracts allows Energy Services to generate market opportunities by capturing price differentials over specific time horizons and between geographic market locations. Energy Services also provides management of transportation and storage assets for natural gas producers and regulated utilities. These management transactions typically involve the release of producer/utility-owned storage and/or transportation capacity in combination with an obligation to either purchase and/or deliver physical natural gas. In addition to the contractual purchase and/or sale of physical natural gas, Energy Services generates or pays fee-based margin in exchange for its active management and may provide the producer and/or utility with additional margin based on actual results. In conjunction with the active management of these contracts, Energy Services generates Financial Margin by identifying market opportunities and simultaneously entering into natural gas purchase/sale, storage or transportation contracts and financial derivative contracts. In cases where storage is utilized to fulfill these contracts, these forecast sales and/or purchases are economically hedged through the use of financial derivative contracts. The financial derivative contracts consist primarily of
47 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              exchange-traded futures, options and swap contracts, and are frequently used to lock in anticipated transactional cash flows and to help manage volatility in natural gas market prices. Generally, when its transportation and storage contracts are exposed to periods of increased market volatility, Energy Services is able to implement strategies that allow it to capture margin by improving the respective time or geographic spreads on a forward basis. Energy Services accounts for its physical commodity contracts and its financial derivative instruments at fair value on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of physical commodity contracts and financial derivative instruments are included in earnings as a component of operating revenues or natural gas purchases on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Volatility in reported net income at Energy Services can occur over periods of time due to changes in the fair value of derivatives, as well as timing differences related to certain transactions. Unrealized gains and losses can fluctuate as a result of changes in the price of natural gas, SRECs and foreign currency from the original transaction price. Volatility in earnings can also occur as a result of timing differences between the settlement of financial derivatives and the sale of the underlying physical commodity. For example, when a financial instrument settles and the physical natural gas is injected into inventory, the realized gains and losses associated with the financial instrument are recognized in earnings. However, the gains and losses associated with the physical natural gas are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas inventory is withdrawn from storage and sold, at which time Energy Services realizes the entire margin on the transaction. During December 2020, Energy Services entered into a series of AMAs with an investment grade public utility to release pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts. The utility provides certain asset management services and Energy Services may deliver natural gas to the utility in exchange for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $500 million, payable through November 1, 2030. The AMAs include a series of initial and permanent releases, which commenced on November 1, 2021. NJR will receive a total of approximately $260 million in cash from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 and $34 million per year from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2031 under the agreements. Energy Services recognized $20.0 million and $22.1 million of operating revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts received in excess of revenue totaling $87.2 million and $33.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, are included in deferred revenue on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating Results Energy Services’ financial results are summarized as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Operating revenues

(2) Costs associated with pipeline and storage capacity are expensed over the term of the related contracts, which generally varies from less than one year to ten years. (3) Includes related party transactions of approximately $242,000 and $225,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a portion of which is eliminated in consolidation. 48 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Energy Services' portfolio of financial derivative instruments are composed of: Three Months Ended December 31, (in Bcf) 2022 2021 Net short futures and swaps contracts 10.7   22.2  During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net short position resulted in an unrealized gain of $25.4 million and $22.8 million, respectively. Operating Revenues and Natural Gas Purchases Operating revenues decreased $47.5 million and natural gas purchases decreased $45.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to volatility in natural gas prices and the related hedging transactions. Future results at Energy Services are contingent upon natural gas market price volatility driven by variations in both the supply and demand balances caused by weather and other factors. As a result, variations in weather patterns in the key market areas served may affect earnings during the fiscal year. Changes in market fundamentals, such as an increase in supply and decrease in demand due to warmer temperatures, and reduced volatility can negatively impact Energy Services' earnings. See

for
TETCO M-3 Daily Prices, which illustrates the daily natural gas prices in the Northeast market region. Operation and Maintenance Expense O&M expense decreased $2.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to a reduction in the reserve for bad debt. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $2.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased borrowings and higher interest rates. Net Income Net income decreased $1.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased interest expense, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower income tax expense related to lower operating income.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses Financial Margin and NFE, non-GAAP financial measures, when evaluating the operating results of Energy Services. Financial Margin and NFE are based on removing timing differences associated with certain derivative instruments. GAAP also requires us, during the interim periods, to estimate our annual effective tax rate and use this rate to calculate the year-to-date tax provision. We also determine an annual estimated effective tax rate for NFE purposes and calculate a quarterly tax adjustment based on the differences between our forecasted net income and our forecasted NFE for the fiscal year. This adjustment is applied to Energy Services, as the adjustment primarily relates to timing differences associated with certain derivative instruments which impacts the estimate of the annual effective tax rate for NFE. No adjustment is needed during the fourth quarter, since the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end. Management views these measures as representative of the overall expected economic result and uses these measures to compare Energy Services' results against established benchmarks and earnings targets as these measures eliminate the impact of volatility on GAAP earnings as a result of timing differences associated with the settlement of derivative instruments. To the extent that there are unanticipated impacts from changes in the market value related to the effectiveness of economic hedges, Energy Services' actual non-GAAP results can differ from the results anticipated at the outset of the transaction. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure. 49 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              When Energy Services reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP measure to both Financial Margin and NFE, the current period unrealized gains and losses on derivatives are excluded as a reconciling item. Financial Margin and NFE also exclude the effects of economic hedging of the value of our natural gas in storage and, therefore, only include realized gains and losses related to natural gas withdrawn from storage, effectively matching the full earnings effects of the derivatives with realized margins on the related physical natural gas flows. Financial Margin differs from gross margin as defined on a GAAP basis as it excludes certain operations and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization as well as the effects of derivatives as discussed above. Financial Margin A reconciliation of gross margin, the closest GAAP financial measure, to Energy Services' Financial Margin is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Operating revenues
(1) $ 321,782   $ 369,244  Less: Natural gas purchases 233,287   278,687  Operation and maintenance
(2) 3,455   (13,871) Depreciation and amortization 57   28  Gross margin 84,983   104,400  Add: Operation and maintenance
(2) 3,455   (13,871) Depreciation and amortization 57   28  Unrealized (gain) on derivative instruments and related transactions (39,886) (85,647) Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory
(3) 23,972   23,577  Financial Margin $ 72,581   $ 28,487  (1) Includes unrealized losses related to an intercompany transaction between NJNG and Energy Services that have been eliminated in consolidation of approximately $8.4 million and $3.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (2) Excludes selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $(2.3) million and $17.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (3) Effects of hedging natural gas inventory transactions where the economic impact is realized in a future period. Financial Margin increased $44.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to higher natural gas price volatility in December 2022, as a result of cold weather in regions where Energy Services had contracted rights to transportation and storage assets. Net Financial Earnings A reconciliation of Energy Services' net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to NFE is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Net income $ 64,561   $ 65,744  Add: Unrealized (gain) on derivative instruments and related transactions (39,886) (85,647) Tax effect
(1) 9,479   20,357  Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory 23,972   23,577  Tax effect (5,697) (5,603) Net income to NFE tax adjustment 104   (861) Net financial earnings $ 52,533   $ 17,567  (1) Includes taxes related to an intercompany transaction between NJNG and Energy Services that have been eliminated in consolidation of approximately $(2.0) million and $(821,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. NFE increased $35.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to higher Financial Margin, as previously discussed. 50 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Future results are subject to Energy Services' ability to expand its wholesale sales and service activities and are contingent upon many other factors, including an adequate number of appropriate and credit qualified counterparties in an active and liquid natural marketplace, volatility in the natural gas market due to weather or other fundamental market factors impacting supply and/or demand, transportation, storage and/or other market arbitrage opportunities, sufficient liquidity in the overall energy trading market, and continued access to liquidity in the capital markets. Storage and Transportation Overview Storage and Transportation invests in natural gas assets, such as natural gas transportation and storage facilities. We believe that acquiring, owning and developing these storage and transportation assets, which operate under a tariff structure that has either cost- or market-based rates, can provide us a growth opportunity. Storage and Transportation is subject to various risks, including the construction, development and operation of our transportation and storage assets, obtaining necessary governmental, environmental and regulatory approvals, our ability to obtain necessary property rights and our ability to obtain financing at reasonable costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of our assets. In addition, our storage and transportation assets may be subject to risk associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disruption to the supply chain and availability of critical equipment and supplies, disruptions to the availability of our specialized workforce and contractors and changes to demand for natural gas, transportation and other downstream activities. Storage and Transportation is comprised of Leaf River, a 32.2 million Dth salt dome natural gas storage facility that operates under market-based rates and Adelphia Gateway, an existing 84-mile pipeline in southeastern Pennsylvania. Adelphia Gateway operates under cost of service rates but can enter into negotiated rates with counterparties. The northern portion of the pipeline was operational upon acquisition and it currently serves two natural gas generation facilities. On October 5, 2020, we began the conversion of the southern zone of the pipeline to natural gas, which became fully operational on September 2, 2022. Storage and Transportation has a 50 percent ownership interest in Steckman Ridge, a storage facility that operates under market-based rates. As of December 31, 2022, our investment in Steckman Ridge was $106.2 million. Storage and Transportation also has a 20 percent interest in PennEast, a partnership whose purpose was to construct and operate a 120-mile natural gas pipeline that would have extended from northeast Pennsylvania to western New Jersey. PennEast received a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the project from FERC in January 2018. However, because of numerous regulatory and legal challenges, we evaluated our equity investment in PennEast for impairment during fiscal 2021, and determined that it was other-than-temporarily impaired. We estimated the fair value of our investment in PennEast using probability weighted scenarios assigned to discounted future cash flows. The impairment was the result of management’s estimates and assumptions regarding the likelihood of certain outcomes related to required regulatory approvals and pending legal matters, the timing and magnitude of construction costs and in-service dates, the evaluation of the current environmental and political climate as it relates to interstate pipeline development, and transportation capacity revenues and discount rates. On December 16, 2021, the FERC dismissed PennEast’s pending applications. The order vacates the certificate authorization for the PennEast pipeline project in light of PennEast’s response to FERC staff’s November 23, 2021 request for a status update, in which PennEast informed the Commission it is no longer developing the project. The order vacates the certificate authorization, subject to leave of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit where the Commission’s certificate and rehearing orders are under review. During fiscal 2022, the PennEast board of managers approved cash distributions to members of the partnership following the sale of certain project-related assets and refunds of interconnection fees received from interstate pipelines. The return of capital received by the Company, which totaled $11.0 million, reduced the remaining carrying value of its equity method investment in PennEast to zero, with the excess recorded in equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 51 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Operating Results The financial results of Storage and Transportation are summarized as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Operating revenues

Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased $14.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased fixed price contract revenue for Adelphia Gateway and increased hub services at Leaf River. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expenses increased $3.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to the southern portion of the Adelphia Gateway project, which was placed in service in September 2022. Other Income, Net Other income decreased $1.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to decreased AFUDC equity related to the Adelphia Gateway project. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $4.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased borrowings and higher interest rates. Net Income Net income increased $3.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, due primarily to increased operating income, partially offset by increased interest expense as previously discussed and income taxes related to the higher operating income. 52 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Home Services and Other Overview The financial results of Home Services and Other consist primarily of the operating results of NJRHS. NJRHS provides service, sales and installation of appliances to service contract customers and has been focused on growing its installation business and expanding its service contract customer base. Home Services and Other also includes organizational expenses incurred at NJR and home warranty contract income at NJR Retail. Operating Results The condensed financial results of Home Services and Other are summarized as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2022 2021 Operating revenues $ 14,266   $ 13,951  Income before income taxes $ 188   $ 693  Income tax provision 217   246  Net (loss) income $ (29) $ 447  Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased $315,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased installation and service contract revenue at NJRHS. Net (Loss) Income Net income decreased $476,000 to a loss of $29,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increased borrowings and higher interest rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our objective is to maintain an efficient consolidated capital structure that reflects the different characteristics of each reporting segment and business operations and provides adequate financial flexibility for accessing capital markets as required. Our consolidated capital structure was as follows: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Common stock equity 37   % 38  % Long-term debt 52   52  Short-term debt 11   10  Total 100   % 100  % Common Stock Equity We satisfy our external common equity requirements, if any, through issuances of our common stock, including the proceeds from stock issuances under our DRP. The DRP allows us, at our option, to use treasury shares or newly issued shares to raise capital. NJR raised approximately $3.8 million of equity through the DRP during both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we raised approximately $17.9 million of equity by issuing approximately 368,000 shares through the waiver discount feature of the DRP. There were no shares issued through the waiver discount feature during the three months ended December 31, 2021. 53 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              In 1996, the Board of Directors authorized us to implement a share repurchase program, which was expanded seven times since the inception of the program, authorizing a total of 19.5 million shares of common stock for repurchase. As of December 31, 2022, we had repurchased a total of approximately 17.8 million of those shares and may repurchase an additional 1.7 million shares under the approved program. There were no shares repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Debt NJR and its unregulated subsidiaries generally rely on cash flows generated from operating activities and the utilization of committed credit facilities to provide liquidity to meet working capital and short-term debt financing requirements. NJNG also relies on the issuance of commercial paper for short-term funding. NJR and NJNG, as borrowers, respectively, periodically access the capital markets to fund long-life assets through the issuance of long-term debt securities. We believe that our existing borrowing availability, equity proceeds and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditures and dividend requirements for at least the next 12 months. NJR, NJNG, Clean Energy Ventures, Storage and Transportation and Energy Services currently anticipate that each of their financing requirements for the next 12 months will be met primarily through the issuance of short and long-term debt and meter or solar asset sale leasebacks. We believe that as of December 31, 2022, NJR and NJNG were, and currently are, in compliance with all existing debt covenants, both financial and non-financial. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, recent geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures, there has been uncertainty and volatility in the credit and capital markets. We have been able to obtain sufficient financing to meet our funding requirements for operations and capital expenditures, however, our ability to access funds from financial institutions at a reasonable cost in the future may impact the nature and timing of future capital market transactions. Short-Term Debt We use our short-term borrowings primarily to finance Energy Services' short-term liquidity needs, Storage and Transportation investments, share repurchases and, on an initial basis, Clean Energy Ventures' investments. Energy Services' use of high-volume storage facilities and anticipated pipeline park-and-loan arrangements, combined with related economic hedging activities in the volatile wholesale natural gas market, create significant short-term cash requirements. As of December 31, 2022, NJR had a revolving credit facility and a term loan totaling $800 million, with $427.7 million available under the facility and term loan. NJNG satisfies its debt needs by issuing short-term and long-term debt based on its financial profile. The seasonal nature of NJNG's operations creates large short-term cash requirements, primarily to finance natural gas purchases and customer accounts receivable. NJNG obtains working capital for these requirements, and for the temporary financing of construction and MGP remediation expenditures and energy tax payments, based on its financial profile, through the issuance of commercial paper supported by the NJNG Credit Facility or through short-term bank loans under the NJNG Credit Facility. NJNG’s commercial paper is sold through several commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement and is supported by the $250 million NJNG Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, the unused amount available under the NJNG Credit Facility, including amounts allocated to the backstop under the commercial paper program and the issuance of letters of credit, was $137.5 million. 54 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Short-term borrowings were as follows: Three Months Ended (Thousands) December 31, 2022 NJR Notes Payable to banks: Balance at end of period $ 352,650   Weighted average interest rate at end of period 5.38   % Average balance for the period $ 401,523   Weighted average interest rate for average balance 4.72   % Month end maximum for the period $ 465,000   NJNG Commercial Paper and Notes Payable to banks: Balance at end of period $ 111,800   Weighted average interest rate at end of period 4.60   % Average balance for the period $ 62,931   Weighted average interest rate for average balance 4.00   % Month end maximum for the period $ 111,800   Due to the seasonal nature of natural gas prices and demand, and because inventory levels are built up during its natural gas injection season (April through October), NJR and NJNG's short-term borrowings tend to peak in the November through January time frame. NJR During fiscal 2021, NJR entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement governing a $500 million NJR Credit Facility, which was to expire on September 2, 2026. The NJR Credit Facility is subject to two mutual options for a one-year extension beyond that date and includes an accordion feature, which allows NJR, in the absence of a default or event of default, to increase from time to time, with the existing or new lenders, the revolving credit commitments under the NJR Credit Facility in increments of $50 million up to a maximum of $250 million. The NJR Credit Facility also permits the borrowing of revolving loans and swingline loans, as well as a $75 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. On August 30, 2022, NJR amended the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to $650 million and extended the maturity date of the facility to September 2, 2027. The amendment also increased the swingline to $70 million from $60 million and moved to SOFR as the benchmark rate, replacing the existing LIBOR. Certain of NJR’s unregulated subsidiaries have guaranteed all of NJR’s obligations under the NJR Credit Facility. The credit facility is used primarily to finance its share repurchases, to satisfy Energy Services’ short-term liquidity needs and to finance, on an initial basis, unregulated investments. As of December 31, 2022, NJR had seven letters of credit outstanding totaling $19.7 million, which reduced the amount available under the NJR Credit Facility by the same amount. NJR does not anticipate that these letters of credit will be drawn upon by the counterparties. In February 2022, NJR entered into a 364-day $150 million term loan credit agreement with an interest rate based on SOFR plus 0.85 percent, which expires on February 7, 2023. The Company borrowed $50 million on February 9, 2022 and $100 million on February 14, 2022 under the term loan. Based on its average borrowings during fiscal 2023, NJR’s average interest rate was 4.72 percent, resulting in interest expense of approximately $4.9 million. Based on average borrowings of $401.5 million during the period, a 100 basis point change in the underlying average interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately $1.0 million during fiscal 2023. Neither NJNG nor its assets are obligated or pledged to support the NJR Credit Facility or term loan credit agreement. 55 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              NJNG During fiscal 2021, NJNG entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement governing a $250 million NJNG Credit Facility, which was to expire on September 2, 2026. The NJNG Credit Facility is subject to two mutual options for a one-year extension beyond that date and permits the borrowing of revolving loans and swingline loans, as well as a $30 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The NJNG Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature, which would allow NJNG, in the absence of a default or event of default, to increase from time to time, with the existing or new lenders, the revolving credit commitments under the NJNG Credit Facility in minimum increments of $50 million up to a maximum of $100 million. On August 30, 2022, NJNG amended the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the facility to September 2, 2027 and moved to SOFR as the benchmark rate, replacing the existing LIBOR. As of December 31, 2022, NJNG had two letters of credit outstanding for $731,000, which reduced the amount available under the NJNG Credit Facility by the same amount. NJNG does not anticipate that these letters of credit will be drawn upon by the counterparties. Based on its average borrowings during fiscal 2023, NJNG’s average interest rate was 4.00 percent, resulting in interest expense of $650,000. Based on average borrowings of $62.9 million during the period, a 100 basis point change in the underlying average interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately $161,000 during fiscal 2023. Short-Term Debt Covenants Borrowings under the NJR Credit Facility, term loan credit agreement and the NJNG Credit Facility are conditioned upon compliance with a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization as defined in the applicable agreements), of not more than .70 to 1.00 for NJR and .65 to 1.00 for NJNG. These revolving credit facilities and term loan credit agreement contain customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type. They also contain customary events of default and certain covenants that will limit NJR's or NJNG's ability, beyond agreed upon thresholds, to, among other things: • incur additional debt;
• incur liens and encumbrances; • make dispositions of assets; • enter into transactions with affiliates; and • merge, consolidate, transfer, sell or lease all or substantially all of the borrower's or guarantors' assets. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable agreements. Default Provisions The agreements governing our long-term and short-term debt obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment or similar actions. Default events include, but are not limited to, the following: • defaults for non-payment; • defaults for breach of representations and warranties; • defaults for insolvency; • defaults for non-performance of covenants; • cross-defaults to other debt obligations of the borrower; and • guarantor defaults. The occurrence of an event of default under these agreements could result in all loans and other obligations of the borrower becoming immediately due and payable and the termination of the credit facilities or term loan. 56 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Long-Term Debt NJR As of December 31, 2022, NJR had the following outstanding: • $50 million of 3.20 percent senior notes due August 18, 2023; • $100 million of 3.48 percent senior notes due November 7, 2024; • $100 million of 3.54 percent senior notes due August 18, 2026; • $110 million of 4.38 percent senior notes due June 23, 2027; • $100 million of 3.96 percent senior notes due June 8, 2028; • $150 million of 3.29 percent senior notes due July 17, 2029; • $130 million of 3.50 percent senior notes due July 23, 2030; • $130 million of 3.60 percent senior notes due July 23, 2032; • $80 million of 3.25 percent senior notes due September 1, 2033; • $120 million of 3.13 percent senior notes due September 1, 2031; • $50 million of 3.64 percent senior notes due September 19, 2034; and • $50 million of 6.14 percent senior notes due December 15, 2032. On October 24, 2022, NJR entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, which closed on December 15, 2022, under which NJR issued $50 million, Series 2022B senior notes at a fixed rate of 6.14 percent, maturing in 2032. The senior notes are unsecured and guaranteed by certain unregulated subsidiaries of NJR. Neither NJNG nor its assets are obligated or pledged to support NJR's long-term debt. NJNG As of December 31, 2022, NJNG's long-term debt consisted of $1.4 billion in fixed-rate debt issuances secured by the Mortgage Indenture, with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2061, and $28.1 million in finance leases with various maturities ranging from 2024 to 2028. On October 24, 2022, NJNG entered into a Note Purchase Agreement for $125 million of its senior notes at an interest rate of 5.47 percent, maturing in 2052. Senior notes are secured by an equal principal amount of NJNG’s FMBs issued under NJNG’s Mortgage Indenture. NJR is not obligated directly or contingently with respect to the NJNG’s fixed-rate debt issuances. Long-Term Debt Covenants and Default Provisions The NJR and NJNG long-term debt instruments contain customary representations and warranties for transactions of their type. They also contain customary events of default and certain covenants that will limit NJR or NJNG's ability beyond agreed upon thresholds to, among other things: • incur additional debt (including a covenant that limits the amount of consolidated total debt of the borrower at the end of a fiscal quarter to 70 percent for NJR and 65 percent for NJNG of the consolidated total capitalization of the borrower, as those terms are defined in the applicable agreements, and a covenant limiting priority debt to 20 percent of the borrower's consolidated total capitalization, as those terms are defined in the applicable agreements); • incur liens and encumbrances; • make loans and investments; • make dispositions of assets; • make dividends or restricted payments; • enter into transactions with affiliates; and • merge, consolidate, transfer, sell or lease substantially all of the borrower's assets. The aforementioned covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable note purchase agreements. 57 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              In addition, the FMBs issued by NJNG under the Mortgage Indenture are subject to certain default provisions. Events of Default, as defined in the Mortgage Indenture, consist mainly of: • failure for 30 days to pay interest when due; • failure to pay principal or premium when due and payable; • failure to make sinking fund payments when due; • failure to comply with any other covenants of the Mortgage Indenture after 30 days' written notice from the Trustee; • failure to pay or provide for judgments in excess of $30 million in aggregate amount within 60 days of the entry thereof; or • certain events that are or could be the basis of a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or receivership proceeding. Upon the occurrence and continuance of such an Event of Default, the Mortgage Indenture, subject to any provisions of law applicable thereto, provides that the Trustee may take possession and conduct the business of NJNG, may sell the trust estate, or proceed to foreclose the lien of the Mortgage Indenture. The interest rate on defaulted principal and interest, to the extent permitted by law, on the FMBs issued under the Mortgage Indenture is the rate stated in the applicable supplement or, if no such rate is stated, six percent per annum. Sale Leaseback NJNG NJNG received $8.4 million and $17.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in connection with the sale leaseback of its natural gas meters. NJNG records a financing lease obligation that is paid over the term of the lease and has the option to purchase the meters back at fair value upon expiration of the lease. NJNG continues to evaluate this sale leaseback program based on current market conditions. Natural gas meters are excepted from the lien on NJNG property under the Mortgage Indenture. Clean Energy Ventures Clean Energy Ventures enters into transactions to sell the commercial solar assets concurrent with agreements to lease the assets back over a period of five to 15 years. These transactions are considered failed sale leasebacks for accounting purposes and are therefore treated as financing obligations, which are typically secured by the renewable energy facility asset and its future cash flows from RECs and energy sales. ITCs and other tax benefits associated with these solar projects are transferred to the buyer, if applicable; however, the lease payments are structured so that Clean Energy Ventures is compensated for the transfer of the related tax incentives. Clean Energy Ventures continues to operate the solar assets, including related expenses, and retain the revenue generated from RECs and energy sales, and has the option to renew the lease or repurchase the assets sold at the end of the lease term. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Clean Energy Ventures received proceeds of $33.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in connection with the sale leaseback of commercial solar projects. The proceeds received were recognized as a financing obligation on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contractual Obligations and Capital Expenditures As of December 31, 2022, there were NJR guarantees covering approximately $222.3 million of natural gas purchases and Energy Services demand fee commitments and nine outstanding letters of credit totaling $20.4 million, as previously mentioned, not yet reflected in accounts payable on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated capital expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, unforeseen events, and the ability to access capital. NJNG's total capital expenditures are projected to be between $352 million and $378 million during fiscal 2023. Total capital expenditures spent or accrued during the three months ended December 31, 2022, were $80.7 million. NJNG expects to fund its obligations with a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, issuance of commercial paper, available capacity under its revolving credit facility and the issuance of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2022, NJNG's future MGP expenditures are estimated to be $125.7 million. For a more detailed description of MGP expenditures see Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 58 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              During the three months ended December 31, 2022, our Storage and Transportation segment had capital expenditures spent or accrued for the Adelphia Gateway project totaling $11.6 million and capital expenditures spent or accrued for Leaf River totaling $0.9 million. During fiscal 2023, we expect expenditures related to the Adelphia Gateway project to be between $12 million and $16 million and expenditures related to Leaf River to be between $8 million and $12 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, total capital expenditures spent or accrued related to the purchase and installation of solar equipment were $43.9 million. Clean Energy Ventures' expenditures include clean energy projects that support our goal to promote renewable energy. Accordingly, Clean Energy Ventures enters into agreements to install solar equipment involving both residential and commercial projects. We estimate solar-related capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 to be between $100 million and $200 million. Capital expenditures related to clean energy projects are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may affect our ability to commence operations at these projects on a timely basis or at all, including sourcing projects that meet our investment criteria, logistics associated with the start-up of residential and commercial solar projects, such as timing of construction schedules, the permitting and regulatory process, any delays related to electric grid interconnection, economic trends or unforeseen events and the ability to access capital or allocation of capital to other investments or business opportunities. Energy Services does not currently anticipate any significant capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 and 2024. During December 2020, Energy Services entered into a series of AMAs with an investment grade public utility to release pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts. The utility provides certain asset management services and Energy Services may deliver natural gas to the utility in exchange for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $500 million, payable through November 1, 2030. The AMAs include a series of initial and permanent releases, which commenced on November 1, 2021. NJR will receive approximately $260 million in cash from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 and $34 million per year from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2031 under the agreements. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, Energy Services recognized $20.0 million of operating revenue on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts received in excess of revenue totaling $87.2 million as of December 31, 2022, are included in deferred revenue on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flows Operating Activities Cash flows used in operating activities during the three months ended December 31, 2022, totaled $88.9 million, compared with $37.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating cash flows are primarily affected by variations in working capital, which can be impacted by several factors, including: • seasonality of our business; • fluctuations in wholesale natural gas prices and other energy prices, including changes in derivative asset and liability values; • timing of storage injections and withdrawals; • the deferral and recovery of natural gas costs; • changes in contractual assets utilized to optimize margins related to natural gas transactions; • broker margin requirements; • impact of unusual weather patterns on our wholesale business; • timing of the collections of receivables and payments of current liabilities; • volumes of natural gas purchased and sold; and • timing of SREC deliveries. Cash flows used in operating activities increased $51.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to additional working capital requirements. 59 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)                                                                                                                                                              Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $145.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $164.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of $18.5 million was due primarily to decreased capital expenditures for Storage and Transportation related to the conversion of the southern portion of Adelphia Gateway's pipeline to natural gas, which was placed into service during September 2022, partially offset by increased solar and utility plant expenditures. Financing Activities Financing cash flows generally are seasonal in nature and are impacted by the volatility in pricing in the natural gas and other energy markets. NJNG's inventory levels are built up during its natural gas injection season (April through October) and reduced during withdrawal season (November through March) in response to the supply requirements of its customers. Changes in financing cash flows can also be impacted by natural gas management and marketing activities at Energy Services and clean energy investments at Clean Energy Ventures. Cash flows from financing activities totaled $235.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $198.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $37.9 million is due primarily to an increase in long-term debt proceeds of $75 million, an increase in proceeds of $29.9 million from solar sale leasebacks and $17.9 million from the waiver discount issuance of common stock, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from short-term debt of $70.2 million and lower proceeds of $8.9 million for meter sale leasebacks. Credit Ratings The table below summarizes NJNG's credit ratings as of December 31, 2022, issued by two rating entities, Moody's and Fitch: Moody's Fitch Corporate Rating N/A A- Commercial Paper P-2 F-2 Senior Secured A1 A+ Ratings Outlook Stable Stable Fitch ratings and outlook were reaffirmed on April 14, 2022. The Moody's ratings and outlook were reaffirmed on September 28, 2022. NJNG's Moody's and Fitch ratings are investment-grade ratings. NJR is not rated by Moody’s or Fitch. Although NJNG is not party to any lending agreements that would accelerate the maturity date of any obligation caused by a failure to maintain any specific credit rating, if such ratings are downgraded below investment grade, borrowing costs could increase, as would the costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships and future financing and our access to capital markets would be reduced. Even if ratings are downgraded without falling below investment grade, NJR and NJNG could face increased borrowing costs under their credit facilities. A rating set forth above is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold NJR's or NJNG's securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Each rating set forth above should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The timing and mix of any external financings will target a common equity ratio that is consistent with maintaining NJNG's current short-term and long-term credit ratings. 60 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                                             Financial Risk Management Commodity Market Risks Natural gas is a nationally traded commodity. Its prices are determined effectively by the NYMEX, ICE and over-the-counter markets. The prices on the NYMEX, CME, ICE and over-the-counter markets generally reflect the national balance of natural gas supply and demand, but are also significantly influenced from time to time by other events. Our regulated and unregulated businesses are subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the price of natural gas. To economically hedge against such fluctuations, we have entered into forwards, futures, options and swap agreements. To manage these derivative instruments, we have well-defined risk management policies and procedures that include daily monitoring of volumetric limits and monetary guidelines. Our natural gas businesses are conducted through two of our operating subsidiaries. NJNG is a regulated utility that uses futures, options and swaps to provide relative price stability, and its recovery of natural gas costs is governed by the BPU. Energy Services uses futures, options, swaps and physical contracts to economically hedge purchases and sales of natural gas. The following table reflects the changes in the fair market value of financial derivatives related to natural gas purchases and sales: Balance Increase Less Balance (Thousands) September 30, 2022 (Decrease) in Fair Market Value Amounts Settled December 31, 2022 Natural Gas Distribution $ (6,196) 7,714  3,977  $ (2,459) Energy Services (6,686) 18,400  11,386  328  Total $ (12,882) 26,114  15,363  $ (2,131) There were no changes in methods of valuations during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The following is a summary of fair market value of financial derivatives as of December 31, 2022, excluding foreign exchange contracts discussed below, by method of valuation and by maturity for each fiscal year period: (Thousands) 2023 2024 2025 - 2027 After 2027 Total Fair Value Price based on ICE (1,813) (1,287) 969  —  (2,131) Total $ (1,813) (1,287) 969  —  $ (2,131) The following is a summary of financial derivatives by type as of December 31, 2022: Volume Bcf Price per MMBtu (1) Amounts included in Derivatives (Thousands) Natural Gas Distribution Futures 23.1  $0.00 - $12.72 $ (2,459) Energy Services Futures (10.7) $2.43 - $13.71 328  Total $ (2,131) (1)     Million British thermal units The following table reflects the changes in the fair market value of physical commodity contracts: Balance Increase Less Balance (Thousands) September 30, 2022 (Decrease) in Fair Market Value Amounts Settled December 31, 2022 Natural Gas Distribution - Prices based on other external data $ 241  (19,573) (20,013) $ 681  Energy Services - Prices based on other external data (20,379) 1,485  3,114  (22,008) Total $ (20,138) (18,088) (16,899) $ (21,327) 61 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued)                        Our market price risk is predominately linked with changes in the price of natural gas at the Henry Hub, the delivery point for the NYMEX natural gas futures contracts. Based on price sensitivity analysis, an illustrative 10 percent movement in the natural gas futures contract price, for example, increases (decreases) the reported derivative fair value of all open, unadjusted Henry Hub natural gas futures and fixed price swap positions by approximately $5.3 million. This analysis does not include potential changes to reported credit adjustments embedded in the $45.1 million reported fair value. Derivative Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis (Thousands) Henry Hub Futures and Fixed Price Swaps Percent increase in NYMEX natural gas futures prices 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% Estimated change in derivative fair value $ —  $ (2,667) $ (5,335) $ (8,002) $ (10,669) Ending derivative fair value $ 45,074  $ 42,407  $ 39,739  $ 37,072  $ 34,405  Percent decrease in NYMEX natural gas futures prices 0% (5)% (10)% (15)% (20)% Estimated change in derivative fair value $ —  $ 2,667  $ 5,335  $ 8,002  $ 10,669  Ending derivative fair value $ 45,074  $ 47,741  $ 50,409  $ 53,076  $ 55,743  Wholesale Credit Risk The following is a summary of gross and net credit exposures, grouped by investment and non-investment grade counterparties, as of December 31, 2022. Gross credit exposure for Energy Services is defined as the unrealized fair value of derivative and energy trading contracts plus any outstanding wholesale receivable for the value of natural gas or power delivered and/or financial derivative commodity contract that has settled for which payment has not yet been received. Gross credit exposure for Storage and Transportation is defined as demand and estimated usage fees for contracted services and/or market value of loan balances for which payment has not yet been received. Net credit exposure is defined as gross credit exposure reduced by collateral received from counterparties and/or payables, where netting agreements exist. The amounts presented below exclude accounts receivable for NJNG retail natural gas sales and services. Energy Services', Clean Energy Ventures' and Storage and Transportation's counterparty credit exposure as of December 31, 2022, is as follows: (Thousands) Gross Credit Exposure Net Credit Exposure Investment grade $ 215,786  $ 191,596  Noninvestment grade 58,329  1,736  Internally rated investment grade 29,487  21,347  Internally rated noninvestment grade 45,658  18,042  Total $ 349,260   $ 232,721   NJNG's counterparty credit exposure as of December 31, 2022, is as follows: (Thousands) Gross Credit Exposure Net Credit Exposure Investment grade $ 47,703  $ 42,130  Noninvestment grade 17,246  —  Internally rated investment grade 5,384  5,034  Internally rated noninvestment grade 1,067  11  Total $ 71,400   $ 47,175   Due to the inherent volatility in the market price for natural gas, electricity and SRECs, the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties. If a counterparty failed to perform the obligations under its contract (for example, failed to make payment for natural gas received), we could sustain a loss. This loss would comprise the loss on natural gas delivered but not paid for and/or the cost of replacing natural gas not delivered or received at a price that exceeds the original contract price. Any such loss could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 62 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part I ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued)                        Effects of Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Rate Fluctuations We are also exposed to changes in interest rates on our debt hedges, variable rate debt and changes in foreign currency rates for our business conducted in Canada using Canadian dollars. We do not believe an immediate 10 percent increase or decrease in interest rates or foreign currency rates would have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Effects of Inflation Any change in price levels has an effect on operating results due to the capital-intensive and regulated nature of our utility subsidiary. The Company’s operations are sensitive to increases in the rate of inflation because of its operational and capital spending requirements in both its regulated and non-regulated businesses. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through cost control, productivity improvements and regulatory actions, when appropriate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information related to the impact of recent increases in inflation rates. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                                                                                                                              Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. 63 New Jersey Resources Corporation Part II ITEM 1.
