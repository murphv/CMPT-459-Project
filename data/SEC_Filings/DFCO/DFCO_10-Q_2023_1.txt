Liquidity and Going Concern
These condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 129,467,297 .
The Company closed a convertible debenture funding on February 4, 2022 for a total principal amount of $ 3,000,000 . The continuation of
the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from related parties, and its ability to identify future
investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing and generating profitable operations from the Company’s
future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements
of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”)
and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30.
We have prepared the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
for interim financial reporting, and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. These condensed consolidated financial
statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary
for a fair presentation of our balance sheets, operating results, and cash flows for the periods presented. Operating results for the
periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for fiscal year 2023. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
10
(b)
Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dalrada Precision Corp., a company incorporated in the State of
California, since June 25, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Health Products, a company incorporated in the State of California, since
October 2, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Technologies, LLC, a company incorporated in the State of Wyoming, since January 1, 2020
(date of incorporation), Dalrada Energy Services, Inc., a company incorporated in the State of Wyoming, since March 17, 2022 (date of
incorporation), since their respective acquisition dates. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Dalrada Financial Corp., Dalrada Health Products Inc., Solas Corp., Empower Genomics, Inc., International Health Group,
Inc., Pala Diagnostics, LLC, Pacific Stem Cells, LLC, Watson Rx Solutions, Inc., Dalrada Precision Corp., Dalrada Energy Services, Inc.,
Likido Corp., Ignite I.T., Bothof Brothers Inc., Prakat Solutions, Inc., Prakat Solutions Private Limited, Likido Ltd., and Deposition
Technologies Ltd., controlled by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which the Company has a variable
interest and for which the Company is the “primary beneficiary” as it has both: (1) the power to direct the activities of
the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially
could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Income attributable to the minority interest
in the Company's majority owned and controlled consolidated subsidiaries is recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests
in the consolidated statements of operations and the noncontrolling interest is reflected as a separate component of the statement of
stockholders' equity, consolidated balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.
(c)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
related to the valuation of inventory, valuation of accrued payroll tax liabilities, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables
used in the computation of share-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances.
The Company bases its estimates and assumptions
on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses
that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from
the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results
of operations will be affected.
(d)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid
instruments with a maturity of six months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes the cash restricted
to withdrawal or usage.
11
(e)
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company generally maintains
balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that
may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not
believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.
When estimating its allowance for credit
losses related to revenues from Covid Testing, the Company differentiates its receivables based on the following customer types: healthcare
insurers, government payers, and cash payers. Additionally, the Company applies assumptions and judgments for assessing collectability
and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from its customers. Historical collection factors we considered for assessing collectability
and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from our customers include the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding,
history of payment amounts, status of collections due, and applicable statutes of limitations.
During the six months ended December 31,
2022, healthcare insurers accounted for over
25 % of total revenues. Also, healthcare insurers and government payers amounted to total
revenue of $ 2,372,415
for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The accounts receivable related to both healthcare insurers and government
payers is $ 2,791,579
as of December 31, 2022.
(f)
Fair Value Measurements
Pursuant to ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used
to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure
fair value:
Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities
for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities
for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent
transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally
from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities
for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the
assets or liabilities.
The Company’s financial instruments
consist principally of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties.
Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of
their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.
The Company records a contingent consideration
liability relating to stock price guarantees included in its acquisition and consulting agreements. The estimated fair value of the contingent
consideration is recorded using a significant observable measure and is therefore classified as a Level 2 financial instrument.
12
The fair value of the contingent consideration
liability related to the Company’s business combinations is valued based on a forward contract and the guaranteed equity value at
settlement as defined in the acquisition agreement. The fair value of the contingent consideration is then calculated based on the guaranteed
equity value at settlement as defined in the acquisition agreement. (See “Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies”).
(g)
Convertible Instruments
The Company evaluates and accounts for
conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities (“ASC
815”).
Applicable U.S. GAAP requires companies
to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according
to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative
instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument
that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable
generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with
the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.
The Company accounts for convertible instruments
(when the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) as follows.
The Company records, when necessary, deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in shares based upon the
differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion
price embedded in the shares.
(h)
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivables are derived from products
and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables on a
customer-by-customer basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived collection
issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have
been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the Company had an allowance
of doubtful accounts of $ 210,945
and $ 119,791 , respectively.
Pala and Empower have a standardized approach
to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to for its COVID-19 testing revenue, including the impact of contractual
allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions. The Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses
by pool based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations
of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding. Although we believe that our estimates
for contractual allowances and patient price concessions are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.
(i)
Inventory
Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost
or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, inventory is comprised of raw materials
purchased from suppliers, work-in-progress, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves
for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated selling price in
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs to sell.
13
(j)
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows:
Schedule of property and equipment, estimated useful life
Estimated Useful Life
Computer and office equipment
3
-
5
years
Machinery and equipment
5
years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of lease term or useful life
Estimated useful lives are periodically
assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired
or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the balance
sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations loss in the period of disposal.
(k)
Business Combinations and Acquisitions
The Company accounts for acquisitions in
which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated
to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The
excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year
from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the
transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company
evaluates the existence of goodwill, indefinite life intangible assets, or a gain from a bargain purchase.
(l)
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets
(property and equipment) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Goodwill is tested annually at June 30
for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.
The annual goodwill impairment test allows
for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting
units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment
tests. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less
than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment
as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
As of June 30, 2022, there were quantitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired in the amount of $ 218,308 . During the second
quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting units to evaluate whether it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As part of that evaluation, the Company
considered the relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market consideration, cost factors and
relevant entity specific conditions. As a result of the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment performed, the Company did
no t
recognize any goodwill impairment charges.
14
An intangible asset is an identifiable
non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual
or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software,
licenses, trademarks, patents, films, and copyrights. The Company’s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
(m)
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers , and its related amendments (collectively known as “ASC 606”), effective January 1, 2019.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
-
Identification of a contract with a customer;
-
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
-
Determination of the transaction price;
-
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
-
Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.
Revenue is recognized when control of the
promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled
to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects
of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services
is expected to be one year or less.
The Company’s revenue is derived
from the sales of its products, which represents net sales recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Product
sales are recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied. Typically, this would
occur upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. The Company
measures revenue as the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods (transaction price).
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns, and discounts. The Company bases its
estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns
and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances is inherently uncertain
and may differ from the Company’s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly
higher or lower than the reserves it established, it will record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in
which it makes such a determination. Reserves for returns, and markdowns are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. Allowance
and discounts are recorded in accounts receivable, net and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included
within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company estimates warranty claims reserves
based on historical results and research and determined that a warranty reserve was not necessary as of December 31, 2022, or 2021.
15
Net revenues from COVID-19 testing accounted
for over 25% of the Company’s total net revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and primarily comprised of a high volume
of relatively low-dollar transactions. Pala and Empower, which provides clinical testing services and other services, satisfies its performance
obligations and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have
been rendered. Pala and Empower do not invoice the patients themselves for testing but relies on healthcare insurers and government payers
for reimbursement for COVID-19 testing. Pala has a standardized approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be
entitled to, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions. We regularly assess
the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of receivables or revenue estimates.
We believe that the collectability of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes, most notably those related
to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide. As such, we strive to implement “best
practices” and work with our third-party billing company to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers
with missing or incorrect billing information. We believe that our collection and revenue estimation processes, along with our close monitoring
of our billing operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material adjustments to reserve estimates. However, changes to our
estimate of the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions could have a material impact
on our results of operations and financial condition in the period that the estimates are adjusted. Adjustments to our estimated contractual
allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates. Although we have limited
track record, further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.
DES recognizes revenue on energy savings
contracts where it provides design, engineering and equipment upgrades to obtain energy savings through Environmental, Social, and Governance
(“ESG”) targets. Up to and upon completion of an energy savings project, DES calculates the monthly energy savings based on
prior and current energy consumption totals. The monthly energy savings total is split between the customer and DES where DES recognizes
revenue on a certain negotiated percentage of the total savings. Upon completion of an energy savings contract, the customer will then
retain 100% of such energy savings. DES records revenue as it provides additional management, consulting and other services as they are
incurred.
DES records a sales-type lease where the
Company is the lessor. The Company records its investment in the plant and equipment, used to upgrade a customer’s real property,
leased to franchisees on a net basis, which is comprised of the present value of fixed lease payments not yet received over the course
of the energy savings agreements. The current and long-term portions of our net investment in sales-type leases are included in “Accounts
Receivable, net – related parties” and “Long-term receivables – related parties” respectively. Unearned
income is recognized as interest income over the lease term. Sales-type leases result in the recognition of gain or loss at the commencement
of the lease, which is recorded to “Revenues – related party.”
DepTec and Bothof recognize revenues using
a cost-based input method, by which we use actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated contract costs to determine, as a percentage,
progress toward contract completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses
are determined.
The Company also earns service revenue
from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs, and courses via
IHG, and management services for Solas. For Prakat and Solas, revenues are recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied
and the services are complete. This is generally at a point of time upon written completion and client acceptance of the project, which
represents transfer of control to the customer. For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while services are performed.

(p)
Stock-based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation
in accordance with ASC 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation
using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods
or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees
and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation was $ 901,721
and $ 1,105,587 , respectively. During the
six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense was $ 1,369,238
and $ 1,783,094 , respectively.
(q)
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company
is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido subsidiary is the British pound. The functional currency of Prakat
is the Indian rupee. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries were translated to United States dollars in accordance
with ASC 830,
Foreign Currency Translation Matters , using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average
rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions are included
in condensed consolidated statements of operations.
(r)
Comprehensive Loss
ASC 220,
Comprehensive Income,
establishes
standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the condensed consolidated financial statements. During
the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s only component of comprehensive income was foreign currency translation
adjustments.
(s)
Non-controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests are classified
as a separate component of equity in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and statements of changes in stockholders’ equity.
Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests are reflected separately from consolidated net loss in the consolidated statements
of comprehensive loss and statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling
financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and non-controlling interests. In addition,
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured
at fair value and the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss.
As of December 31, 2022, non-controlling
interests pertained to the Company’s Prakat and Pala subsidiaries.
(t)
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share
The Company computes net income (loss)
per share in accordance with ASC 260,
Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per
share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect
to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock
using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of
shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants.
18
The weighted average number of common stock
equivalents related to convertible notes payable of
790,976
shares and
0
shares, and cashless warrants of
17,225,000
and
1,000,000 , was
not included in diluted loss per share, because the effects are antidilutive, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
There were no adjustments to the numerator
during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(u)
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using
the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,
Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides
that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to
be realized.
(v)
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
(w)
Contingent Consideration
The Company estimates and records the acquisition
date fair value of contingent consideration as part of purchase price consideration for acquisitions. Additionally, each reporting period,
the Company estimates changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and recognizes any change in fair in the consolidated statement
of operations. The estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration requires very subjective assumptions to be made of future operating
results, discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential operating result scenarios. Future revisions to these assumptions
could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration and therefore, materially affect the Company’s
future financial results. The contingent consideration liability is to be settled with the issuance of shares of common stock once contingent
provisions set forth in respective acquisition agreements have been achieved. Upon achievement of contingent provisions, respective liabilities
are relieved and offset by increases to common stock and additional paid in capital in the stockholders’ deficit section of the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The contingent consideration decreased by $ 139,200
to a balance of $ 4,731,600
during the
six months ended December 31, 2022.

Investment in Pala Diagnostics
In August 2021, Dalrada, through its subsidiary
Dalrada Health, entered into a joint venture (“JV”) with Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc (“Vivera”) for a
51 % ownership
and controlling interest. The JV, Pala Diagnostics, LLC (“Pala”) is a CLIA-certified diagnostics lab focused on SARS-CoV-2
testing for now with additional testing capabilities to be introduced. The JV has been treated as a business combination.
We determined that Pala is a Variable Interest
Entity (VIE), We believe that the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance
of Pala, and accordingly, Dalrada is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The Company has consolidated the activities of the
VIE.
Pursuant to the partnership agreement, Dalrada
contributed equity in the amount of $ 500,000
for operating capital and Vivera contributed property and equipment at a fair value of $ 111,185 .
This amount was recorded to non-controlling interest equity balance in the consolidated balance sheets.
19
Pursuant to the JV agreement, Dalrada issued
250,000
shares of common stock to Vivera in October 2021. The fair value of $ 58,560
was recorded to goodwill as of December 31, 2022.
In December 2021, Dalrada Health filed suit
against Vivera and Paul Edalat, Vivera’s Chairman and CEO, for misappropriation of funds on behalf of the joint venture in the amount
of $ 2,104,509 , accounted for as an unauthorized distribution. In addition to filing a cross-complaint against Dalrada Health Products,
Vivera filed a separate complaint against Dalrada Financial Corporation, Empower Genomics (a subsidiary of Dalrada Financial Corporation),
Dalrada Financial Corporation’s officers, and other unrelated parties. The proceedings are being held at the Superior Court of the
State of California, for the County of Orange – Central Justice Center.

Business Combinations and Acquisition
Bothof Brothers Construction Inc. (“Bothof”)
On October 17, 2022, the Company acquired
100% of the common stock of Bothof. The Company assumed the net liabilities of the Bothof in exchange for the employment services of the
selling shareholder. All consideration in the transaction requires the continued employment of the selling shareholder and thus is not
consideration transferred under ASC 805.
The Company entered into a 36-month employment
agreement with the selling shareholder for $ 30,000
monthly and additionally issued
3,000,000
cashless warrants, at a strike price of $ 0.15
per share, to equal $ 450,000 , which shall vest quarterly over a period of 24 months (the “Warrant Consideration”).
If at the end of the 24-month warrant distribution period, beginning
on the effective date of October 17, 2022 (the “Distribution Period”), the value of cashless warrants does not equate to $ 6,000,000
(the “Target Amount”) in value, then the Company shall issue additional cashless warrants equal to the shortfall between the
value of the Warrants Consideration and the Target Amount (the “Valuation Shortfall”).
The following is a summary of the value of the Warrant Consideration
to the selling shareholder. The Company records the value on a straight line basis over the vesting period of 24-months:
Schedule of warrant consideration
Warrant Consideration
$ 3,482,550
The Warrant Consideration is contingent
on the selling shareholder’s continued employment with the Company; therefore, it is treated as stock-based compensation expense
and recognized ratably over a 24-month period.
The Company acquired Bothof to facilitate
the work of and expand the Dalrada Energy Services segment. Bothof’s selling shareholder holds certain licenses, construction/engineering
design expertise and management skills which will leverage synergies with Dalrada Energy Services.
The Bothof transaction was
accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business
Combinations (“ASC 805”). The Company has determined preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. These values are subject to change as we perform additional reviews of our assumptions utilized and expect to finalize any
changes to the purchase price allocation prior to filing the fiscal year 2023 year ending June 30, 2023.

The Company has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase
price regarding the acquisition related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the purchase date. The following table summarizes

Convertible Notes
On February 4, 2022, the Company”

convertible debentures (the “Debentures”) in the aggregate principal amount of $ 3,000,000 , including net proceeds received
of $ 2,880,000
from February to March 2022.
The Debentures have a fixed conversion price
of $ 0.9151
per share (the “Fixed Conversion Price”). The principal and interest, which will accrue at a rate of
5 % per annum,
payable under the Debentures will mature 15 months from the issuance date (the “Maturity Date”), unless earlier converted
or redeemed by the Company. At any time before the Maturity Date, the Buyer may convert the Debentures into the Company’s common
stock at the Fixed Conversion Price. Beginning on May 1, 2022, and continuing on the first day of each calendar month thereafter through
February 1, 2023, the Principal amount plus a 20% redemption premium and plus accrued and unpaid interest will be subject to monthly redemption
(“Monthly Redemption”). Under Monthly Redemption, the Company shall redeem an applicable redemption amount in accordance with
the redemption schedule provided in the Debenture, which is subject to pro rata adjustment to reflect the conversion or redemption otherwise
effected pursuant to the Debenture contemporaneous with or prior to the scheduled redemption date, in cash, in common stock through the
Buyer’s conversion of the Debenture (at any time after the applicable redemption date), or a combination of both at the Company’s
option. With respect to each Monthly Redemption all or partially in common stock, the conversion price shall be the lower of (1) the Fixed
Conversion Price, or (2) 100% of the lowest daily VWAP during the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion
(the “Variable Conversion Price”). The conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the other terms and
conditions of the Debenture. At no point will the conversion price be less than $0.01.
The Company, in its sole discretion, may
redeem in cash amounts owed under the Debentures prior to the Maturity Date by providing the Buyer with advance written notice at least
10 trading days prior to such redemption, provided that the Shares are trading below the Fixed Conversion Price at the time of the redemption
notice. The Company shall pay a redemption premium equal to 20% (the “Redemption Premium”) of the principal amount being redeemed.
In connection with the Debenture, the Company
issued to the Buyer warrants equal to 30% coverage exercisable at a strike price equal to the Fixed Conversion Price determined at the
date of the initial closing, or a total of
983,499
warrants to purchase common stock. The Warrants shall be exercisable for four years
and shall be exercised on a cash basis provided the Company is not in default and the shares underlying the Warrant are subject to an
effective registration statement at the time of the Investor’s exercise. There is a cashless provision.
The Company analyzed the conversion feature
of the warrants and determined they did not need to be bifurcated under ASC 815. Based on adoption of ASU-2020-06, the debt will be accounted
for as traditional convertible debt with no portion of the proceeds attributed to the conversion feature. The warrants issued with the
debt will be accounted for as a debt discount and will be amortized as interest expense over the life of the note. The warrants were valued
using the Monte Carlo model and the Company recognized $ 1,427,495
as a debt discount. Key variables used in the valuation are as follows:

Stock-Based Compensation
Dalrada Financial Corp 2020 Stock Compensation
Plan
On July 9, 2020, the Board authorized the
Dalrada Financial Corp 2020 Stock Compensation Plan to be used to compensate the company board of directors. The plan allocates the issuance

shares. On February 25, 2021, the Company amended the plan to issue up to
4,500,000
shares and issued an aggregate
of
4,500,000
common shares, or 500,000 shares to each board member (9).

shares of common stock were granted on July 9, 2020,

term. The Company recorded stock-based compensation related to the 6,500,000 shares in prior periods. The issuance of the warrants was
treated as a modification and, as a result of the value of the stock-based compensation of the shares cancelled being greater than the
stock-based compensation related to the cashless warrants issued, no additional stock-based compensation expense was recorded for the
year ended June 30, 2022.
On November 30, 2021, the Company issued
2,275,000
cashless warrants to employees and consultants for services performed.

which was calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
On October 7, 2022, the Company issued
3,000,000
cashless warrants to the selling shareholder of Bothof in connection with acquisition of Bothof. The warrants vest over a 24-month period

per share. The cashless warrants expire in ten years after issuance. The fair value of the cashless
warrants granted was $ 1.26
per share, or $ 3,482,550
which was calculated using the Fair Value method. The cashless warrants are contingent
on the selling shareholder’s continued employment with the Company; therefore, it is treated as stock-based compensation expense
and recognized ratably over a 24-month period.

Commitments and Contingencies
Lease Commitments
The Company determines if an arrangement
is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the
use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying
asset is conveyed to the Company if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all the economic benefits
from using the underlying asset. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which the Company has
elected to account for as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. Lease expense for variable lease components is
recognized when the obligation is probable.
Operating lease right of use (“ROU”)
assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating
lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily leases buildings (real
estate) which are classified as operating leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate
implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As an implicit interest rate is not
readily determinable in the Company's leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at commencement
date in determining the present value of lease payments.
The lease term for all the Company's leases
includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate)
the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the
lessor. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the majority of the Company's leases
as the reasonably certain threshold is not met.
Lease payments included in the measurement
of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments, variable payments that depend on index or rate, and amounts probable to be payable
under the exercise of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if reasonably certain.
Variable lease payments not dependent on
a rate or index associated with the Company's leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on
which those payments are assessed as probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company's income statement
in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments. As of and during the six months ended December 31, 2022, management
determined that there were no variable lease costs.

to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) and our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30 2022. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Quarterly Report.

Overview
Moving the world forward takes bold resolve that turns
ideas into actions and builds real-time solutions that positively impact people and the planet. Dalrada accelerates positive change for
current and future generations by harnessing true potential and developing products and services that become transformative innovations.
Dalrada Financial Corporation, (“Dalrada”),
was incorporated in September 1982 under the laws of the State of California. It was reincorporated in May 1983 under the laws of the
State of Delaware and reincorporated again on May 5, 2020, under the laws of the state of Wyoming. Dalrada Financial Corporation trades
under the symbol, OTCQB: DFCO.
Since Dalrada’s inception, the Company has grown
its footprint to include the unique business divisions: Dalrada Health, Dalrada Energy Services, Dalrada Precision Manufacturing, and
Dalrada Technologies. Within each of these divisions, the Company drives transformative innovation while creating solutions that are sustainable,
accessible, and affordable. Dalrada’s global solutions directly address climate change, gaps in the health care industry, and technology
needs that facilitate a new era of human behavior and interaction and ensure a bright future for the world around us.
Our net loss and limited working capital raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We incurred a net loss of $4,482,165 and $7,652,341 during the three and six months
ended December 31, 2022, respectively. We will be required to raise substantial capital to fund our capital expenditures, working capital,
and other cash requirements. We will continue to rely on related parties and seek other financing to complete our business plans. The
successful outcome of future financing activities cannot be determined at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, we
will have sufficient funds to execute our intended business plan or generate positive operational results.
In addition to our current deficit, we may incur additional
losses during the foreseeable future, until we are able to successfully execute our business plan. There is no assurance that we will
be able to obtain additional financing through private placements and/or public offerings necessary to support our working capital requirements.
To the extent that funds generated from any private placements and/or public offerings are insufficient, we will have to raise additional
working capital through other sources, such as bank loans and/or financings. No assurance can be given that additional financing will
be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms.
34
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising
interest rates and currency fluctuations, have direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s business. The Company believes these
factors have impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
We are incurring increased costs as a result of being
a publicly traded company. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private
company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. These new rules and regulations have increased our legal
and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, as a result of becoming a public
company, we have created additional board committees and have adopted policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and
procedures. In addition, we have incurred additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. As a result of the
new rules, it may become more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive
officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of being a public company or the timing
of such costs.

Backlog
Backlog represents revenue we expect to realize for
work completed by our consolidated subsidiaries. Backlog is expressed in terms of gross revenue and, therefore, may include significant
estimated amounts of third party or pass-through costs to subcontractors and other parties. We record revenue as goods are delivered,
services are performed or when energy savings are obtained on certain DES contracts, as described in Note 2. (m), Revenue Recognition,
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We calculate backlog without regard to possible project reductions or expansions
or potential cancellations until such changes or cancellations occur. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately realize our full
backlog. Backlog fluctuates due to the timing of when contracts are awarded and contracted and when contract revenue is recognized. Our
backlog by division is presented in the following table:
As of December 31,
2022

was $7,652,341 compared to net loss of $3,044,311 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of $128,467,297. The Company continues to incur significant losses and raises substantial doubt regarding the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. We anticipate needing additional liquidity during the next twelve months to fund operations, expand
our subsidiaries, expand the growth of the COVID-19 testing segment, continue the commercialization of our Likido heating & cooling
units and growing the Dalrada Energy Services subsidiary. Management is planning to support operations by raising capital, and by accelerating
sales & marketing efforts of high-margin heating & cooling units, precision parts, Dalrada Energy Services, DepTec’s deposition
systems and COVID-19 testing. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from
its management, its ability to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing and generate profitable operations from the Company’s
planned future operations. We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations.
Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional
sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and activities and there are no plans
to induce conversion of existing debt. There are no assurances that our plans will be successful. These financial statements do not include
any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Our primary sources of liquidity
are cash from operations and cash on hand from related party loans. Our primary requirements for liquidity are to fund our working capital
needs, debt service, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and general corporate needs.
As of December 31, 2022, we
maintained a cash and cash equivalents balance of $1,110,034 and $426,920 of restricted cash with a working capital deficit of $16,971,401.
The working capital deficit is primarily due to the current portion of the related party notes payable.
Working Capital
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had current assets
of $10,340,331 and current liabilities $27,311,732 compared with current assets of $9,563,566 and current liabilities of $20,416,745 on
June 30, 2022. The decrease in the working capital was primarily a result of increased related party loans.

Company used $4,911,404 of cash for operating activities compared to $4,728,921 used during the six months ended December 31, 2021. The
primary increase in the use of cash for operating activities was a result of the reduction in accounts receivable related to the COVID-19
business and the purchase of inventory from the Precision Manufacturing division.

During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company used $920,328 of cash for investing activities compared to $337,728 used during the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase
in the use of cash for investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of equipment used primarily for the Dalrada Precision Manufacturing
segment.
Cash flow from Financing Activities
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company received $6,566,991 in cash from financing activities compared to $5,097,451 during the six months ended December 31, 2021. The
increase was primarily due to the increase in proceeds from related party notes payable.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, and related party transactions.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and
estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note (1) of the notes to
our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals,
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from
those estimates made by management.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes for the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the
use of management estimates relate to the valuation of its mineral leases and claims and our ability to obtain final government permission
to complete the project. As of December 31, 2022 there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates
from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
41
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance
with ASC 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services
are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received
or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the
cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not
yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.
Contractual Obligations
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q (the "Evaluation Date"), concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms. The control weaknesses mentioned below were first identified during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected,
or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving an entity's disclosure objectives. The likelihood of
achieving such objectives is affected by limitations inherent in disclosure controls and procedures. These include the fact that human
judgment in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human failures such as simple errors
or mistakes or intentional circumvention of the established process.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f).
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("2013 COSO
Framework").
42
A material weakness is a deficiency or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Our management concluded we have a material weakness
due to the following:
·
Lack of Management oversight and review of the financial reporting process, including presentation of the financial statements and related disclosures;
·
Lack of procedures related to recognition of revenues;
·
Lack of procedures related to the calculation and allocation of the purchase price, including acquired intangibles, in connection with business acquisitions.
