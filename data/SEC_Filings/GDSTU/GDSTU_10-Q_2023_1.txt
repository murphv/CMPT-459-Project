CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some statements contained in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Form 10-Q”) are forward-looking in nature. Our forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies
regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or
circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,”
“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,”
“plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,”
“would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that
a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q may include, for example, statements about:
●
our ability to complete our initial business combination;
●
our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination;
●
our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements;
●
our potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination;
●
our pool of prospective target businesses;
●
the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities;
●
our public securities’ potential liquidity and trading;
●
the lack of a market for our securities;
●
the use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; or
●
our financial performance following our offering.
The forward-looking statements
contained in this Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects
on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements
involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or
performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these
risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from
those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

GOLDENSTONE ACQUISITION
LIMITED
NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND
Goldenstone Acquisition Limited (the “Company”)
is a Delaware corporation incorporated as a blank check company on September 9, 2020. The Company was formed for the purpose of entering
into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with
one or more businesses or entities (the “Business Combination”). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic
region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination.
The Company has selected March 31 as its fiscal
year end. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. For the period from September 9, 2020 (inception) to
December 31, 2022, the Company’s efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the Initial
Public Offering (as defined below). The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination,
at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial
Public Offering.
On March 21, 2022, the Company closed its initial
public offering of
5,750,000
units, which includes
the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The units were
sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, resulting in total gross proceeds of $57,500,000. Each unit consists of one share of common stock,
one redeemable warrant and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock. Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder
thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of common stock, and each ten (10) rights entitle the holder thereof to receive one share
of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination. The exercise price of the warrants is $11.50 per full share.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial
Public Offering, the Company completed the private sale of
351,250
units (the “Private Units”) to the Sponsor, Ray Chen, our
Chief Financial Officer, and Yongsheng Liu, our Chief Operating Officer, each through their respective affiliated entities.
Each Private
Unit consists of one share of common stock, one warrant (“Private Warrant”) and one right (each, a “Private Right”).
Each Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share.
Each Private Right entitles the holder to receive one-tenth of one share of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination.
The
Private Units were sold at a purchase price of $ 10.00
per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 3,512,500 . The Private
Units are identical to the Public Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the holders of the Private Units have agreed
not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units and the underlying securities (except to certain permitted transferees) until
the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination.
The Company also issued
57,500
shares of Common
Stock (the “Representative Shares”) to Maxim Group LLC and/or its designees (“Maxim”) as part of representative
compensation. The representative shares are identical to the Common Stock sold as part of the Public Units, except that Maxim Group LLC
has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such representative shares until the completion of the Company’s initial Business
Combination. In addition, Maxim Group LLC has agreed (i) to waive its redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with
the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the
trust account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within 12 months (or up to
21 months if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination) from the effective date of its registration
statement. The shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately
following the commencement of sales of the offering pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of FINRA’s Rules. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1),
these securities may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated nor may they be the subject of any hedging, short sale,
derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180
days immediately following the commencement of sales of this offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the
offering and their officers or partners, registered persons or affiliates. The Company used a Black-Scholes option-pricing Model that
values the Representative Shares granted to Maxim Group LLC and/or its designees. The key inputs into the Binomial model were (i) risk-
free interest rate of
0.75 %, (ii) volatility of
12.96 %, (iii) expected life of 1 year, and (iv)
85 % probability of business combination.
According to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the fair value of the
57,500
Representative Shares was approximately $ 441,025
or
$ 7.67
per share.
5
The Company also sold to Maxim, for $ 100 , a Unit
Purchase Option (“UPO”) to purchase
270,250
Units exercisable at $ 11.00
per Unit, for an aggregate exercise price of $ 2,972,750 ,
commencing on the later of the first anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering
and the consummation of a Business Combination. The UPO may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option,
and expires five years from the effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering. The Units issuable
upon exercise of the option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit purchase
option, inclusive of the receipt of the $ 100
cash payment and the fair value of $ 208,093 , or $ 7.67
per Unit, as an expense of the Initial
Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The fair value of the UPO granted to Maxim was estimated
as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of
12.96 %, (2) risk-free interest rate of
1.61 %, (3)
expected life of
5
years and (4)
85 % probability of successful combination.
Transaction costs amounted to $ 4,331,021 , consisting
of $ 1,150,000
of underwriting discounts and commissions, $ 2,012,500
of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, $ 519,403
of other
offering costs, $ 441,025
fair value of the
57,500
representative shares and $ 208,093
fair value of the UPO considered as part of the transaction
costs.
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering
and the issuance and the sale of Private Units on March 21, 2022, $ 58,362,500
($ 10.15
per Public Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale
of the Public Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Units was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”)
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC as a trustee and invested the proceeds in U.S. government treasury bills,
bonds or notes having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be
an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds held in the trust account will not be released until the earlier
of: (1) the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination within the required time period and (2) its redemption of
100 %
of the outstanding public shares if the Company has not completed a Business Combination in the required time period. Therefore, unless
and until the Company’s initial Business Combination is consummated, the proceeds held in the trust account will not be available
for the Company’s use for any expenses related to the Initial Public Offering or expenses which the Company may incur related to
the investigation and selection of a target business and the negotiation of an agreement in connection with its initial Business Combination.
The Company will provide its public shareholders
with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of an initial Business Combination at a per-share
price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation
of its initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the
Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to certain limitations. The amount in the Trust
Account is initially anticipated to be $ 10.15
per public share. The per-share amount the Company will distribute to investors who properly
redeem their shares will not be reduced by deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in
Note 6). The common stock subject to redemption is being recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion
of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity.”
The Company will proceed with a Business Combination
if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $ 5,000,001
upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks
shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote
is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant
to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included
in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.
The Company will provide its stockholders with
the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection
with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the
Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its
discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the
Trust Account (initially $ 10.15
per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account.
6
The Company’s initial stockholders (the
“initial stockholders”) have agreed (a) to vote the founders shares and the common stock (“Insider Shares”) underlying
the Private Units (the “Private Shares”) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor
of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate
of incorporation that would stop the public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to the Company in connection with a Business
Combination or affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem
100 % of the Public Shares if the Company does
not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period unless the Company provides dissenting public stockholders with the
opportunity to convert their Public Shares into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with any such vote; (c)
not to convert any Insider Shares and Private Units (including underlying securities) (as well as any Public Shares purchased during or
after the Initial Public Offering) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve
a Business Combination (or sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination) or a vote to amend the provisions
of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights of pre-Business Combination activity and
(d) that the Insider Shares and Private Units (including underlying securities) shall not participate in any liquidating distributions
upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the initial stockholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to
complete its Business Combination.
The Company will have until 12 months from the
closing of the Initial Public Offering. However, if the Company anticipates that it may not be able to consummate a Business Combination
within 12 months, the Company may, but is not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination three times
by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a Business Combination) (the “Combination Period”).
In order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the initial stockholders or their affiliates
or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $ 575,000
($ 0.10
per share in either case), on or prior to the applicable deadline, for
each three month extension (or up to an aggregate of $ 1,500,000
(or $ 1,725,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
in full), or $ 0.30
per share if the Company extends for the full nine months).
If the Company is unable to complete a Business
Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly
as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem
100 % of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable,
and less up to $ 50,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption
will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
the remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations
under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights
or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s public warrants, public rights, or private rights. The warrants and rights
will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the 12-month time period (or up to 21 months
from the closing of Initial Public Offering if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination by the full
amount of time). The underwriters have agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in
the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be
included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of
such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than $ 10.15 .
Goldenstone Holding, LLC, our sponsor (“Sponsor”),
has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to
the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount
of funds in the trust account to below (i) $ 10.15
per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account
as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest
which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access
to the trust account and except as to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event
that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any
liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust
Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities
with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or
to monies held in the Trust Account.

Termination of the Merger Agreement
On June 21, 2022, the Company entered into a Merger
Agreement (the “Agreement”) by and among Roxe Holding Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Target”), the Company,
Goldenstone Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Amazon
Capital Inc., solely in its capacity as representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the Target Securityholders (the “Securityholder
Representative”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Target (the “Merger”) with the Target as
the surviving corporation of the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Merger, the Company
will change its name to “Roxe Holding Group Inc.” The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has unanimously
(i) approved and declared advisable the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) resolved to recommend
approval of the Agreement and related matters by the stockholders of the Company. Effective September 30, 2022, the Company and the Target
entered into a Joint Agreement to Terminate Merger Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”). The termination was by mutual
agreement of the Company and the Target pursuant to Section 10.1(c) of the Agreement and no termination fee or other payment is due to
either party from the other as a result of the termination.
Liquidity and Going Concern
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 279,541
in cash held outside its Trust Account available for the Company’s payment of expenses related to working capital purposes subsequent
to the Initial Public Offering and working capital of $ 74,074 .
In connection with the Company’s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined
that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The management’s
plan in addressing this uncertainty is through the Working Capital Loans, as defined below (see Note 6). In addition, if the Company is
unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period by March 20, 2023, the Company’s board of directors would
proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Company’s
plans to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that
such condition raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed financial
statements does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal
1 % excise
tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries
of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation
itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value
of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations
are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the
same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”)
has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.
Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise,
may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business
Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and
repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the
nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not
in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations
and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder,
the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available
on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a Business Combination.
NOTE 2 — SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statement is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)
and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and include all normal and recurring adjustments that management of the Company
considers necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and operation results. Interim results are not necessarily indicative
of results to be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read
in conjunction with information included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2022.
8
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Company is an “emerging growth company,”
as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”),
and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that
are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting
firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Further, Section 102(b) (1) of the JOBS Act exempts
emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that
is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered
under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company
can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but
any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that
when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging
growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison
of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth
company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting
standards used.
Use of Estimates
In preparing this unaudited condensed financial
statement in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported expenses during the reporting
period.
Making estimates requires management to exercise
significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances
that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near
term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Cash
The Company considers all short-term investments
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
Investments held in Trust Account
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, $ 59,215,652
and $ 58,364,703 , respectively, of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury
securities.
The Company classifies its U.S. Treasury and equivalent
securities as held-to-maturity in accordance with ASC Topic 320 “Investments — Debt and Equity Securities.” Held-to-maturity
securities are those securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Held-to-maturity treasury securities
are recorded at amortized cost on the accompanying balance sheet and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts.
Warrants
The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified
or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance
in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC
480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding
financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants
meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s
own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside
of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional
judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
9
For issued or modified warrants that meet all
of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance.
For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded
as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair
value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations (See Note 8).
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
The Company accounts for its common stock subject
to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at
fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that is either within the control
of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified
as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s common stock features
certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future
events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the
stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.
The Company has made a policy election in accordance
with ASC 480-10-S99-3A and recognizes changes in redemption value in additional paid-in capital (or accumulated deficit in the absence
of additional paid-in capital) over an expected 12-month period leading up to a Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022 and March
31, 2022, the Company recognized accumulated accretion of initial measurement of common stock subject to redemption value of $ 7,906,234
and $ 257,493 , respectively, with unrecognized accretion of $ 2,444,677
and $ 10,093,419 , respectively, remaining.
Offering Costs
The Company complies with the requirements of
FASB ASC Topic 340-10-S99-1, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs – SEC Materials” (“ASC 340-10-S99”) and SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A, “Expenses of Offering”. Offering costs were $ 4,331,021
consisting principally of underwriting,
legal, accounting and other expenses that are directly related to the IPO and charged to stockholders’ equity upon the completion
of the IPO.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution and money market funds held in the Trust
Account. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks
on such account. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, approximately $ 59.2
million and $ 59.1
million, respectively, was over the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limit.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures” defines fair value, the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between the
buyer and the seller at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the valuation techniques consistent with the market approach,
income approach and cost approach shall be used to measure fair value. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs, which
represent the assumptions used by the buyer and seller in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are further defined as observable
and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are those that buyer and seller would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market
data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that
the buyer and seller would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
10
The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three
levels based on the inputs as follows:
● Level
1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not being applied. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily
and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
● Level
2 - Valuations based on (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in markets that are
not active for identical or similar assets, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities, or (iv) inputs that
are derived principally from or corroborated by market through correlation or other means.
● Level
3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
The fair value of the Company’s assets and
liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates
the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC
740 Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected
impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit
to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when
it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process
for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits
to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest
and penalties as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result
in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.
The Company has identified the United States as
its only “major” tax jurisdiction.
The Company may be subject to potential examination
by federal and state taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing
and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company’s
management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.
11
Net Income (Loss) per Share
The Company complies with accounting and disclosure
requirements of FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. In order to determine the net income (loss) attributable to both the redeemable shares
and non-redeemable shares, the Company first considered the undistributed income (loss) allocable to both the redeemable Common Stock
and non-redeemable Common Stock and the undistributed income (loss) is calculated using the total net loss less any dividends paid. The
Company then allocated the undistributed income (loss) ratably based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the
redeemable and non-redeemable Common Stock. Any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value of the Common Stock subject to possible
redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public stockholders. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company has not considered the effect of the Warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering to purchase an aggregate of
5,750,000
shares
in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share, since the exercise of the Warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future
events and the inclusion of such Warrants would be anti-dilutive and the Company did not have any other dilutive securities and other
contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into Common Stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. For the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially,
be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share
is the same as basic (income) loss per share for the period presented.
The net income (loss) per share presented in the
statement of operations is based on the following:

Related parties
Parties, which can be a corporation or individual,
are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant
influence over the other party in making financial and operational decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are
subject to common control or common significant influence.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued a new standard
(ASU 2020-06) to reduce the complexity of accounting for convertible debt and other equity-linked instruments. For certain convertible
debt instruments with a cash conversion feature, the changes are a trade-off between simplifications in the accounting model (no separation
of an “equity” component to impute a market interest rate, and simpler analysis of embedded equity features) and a potentially
adverse impact to diluted earnings per share by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The new standard will also impact other
financial instruments commonly issued by both public and private companies. For example, the separation model for beneficial conversion
features is eliminated simplifying the analysis for issuers of convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. Also, certain specific
requirements to achieve equity classification and/or qualify for the derivative scope exception for contracts indexed to an entity’s
own equity are removed, enabling more freestanding instruments and embedded features to avoid mark-to-market accounting. The new standard
is effective for companies that are SEC filers (except for smaller reporting companies) for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2021 and interim periods within that year, and two years later for other companies. Companies can early adopt the standard at the
start of a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2020. The standard can either be adopted on a modified retrospective or a full
retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 on April 1, 2022 did not have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited condensed
financial statements.
Management does not believe that any other recently
issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited condensed
financial statements.
NOTE 3 — INVESTMENTS HELD IN TRUST ACCOUNT
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, assets
held in the Trust Account were comprised of $ 59,215,652
and $ 58,364,703 , respectively, in money market funds which are invested in U.S.
Treasury Securities.
The following table presents information about
the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 and indicates

NOTE 4 — INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On March 21, 2022, the Company closed its Initial
Public Offering of
5,750,000
units, which includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The units were
sold at a price of $ 10.00
per unit, resulting in total gross proceeds of $ 57,500,000 .
Each unit consists of one share of common stock,
one redeemable warrant and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock.
Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder
thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of common stock, and each ten (10) rights entitle the holder thereof to receive one share
of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination.
The exercise price of the warrants is $ 11.50
per full share. The warrants will
become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination or 12 months from
the closing of the Initial Public Offering, and will expire five years after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination
or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
13
All of the
5,750,000
public shares sold as part of the Public Units
in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares if there is a stockholder
vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended
and restated certificate of incorporation, or in connection with the Company’s liquidation. In accordance with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified
in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require Common Stock subject to redemption to be
classified outside of permanent equity.
The Company’s redeemable Common Stock is
subject to SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable
that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the
period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the
earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying
amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes
over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the instrument of twelve months. The accretion or remeasurement
is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the
common stock reflected on the balance sheet is reconciled in the following table.

NOTE 5 — PRIVATE PLACEMENT
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial
Public Offering, the Company completed the private sale of
351,250
units (the “Private Units”) to the Sponsor, Ray Chen, our
Chief Financial Officer, and Yongsheng Liu, our Chief Operating Officer, each through their respective affiliated entities.
Each Private
Unit consists of one share of common stock, one warrant (“Private Warrant”) and one right (each, a “Private Right”).
Each Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share.
Each Private Right entitles the holder to receive one-tenth of one share of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination.
The
Private Units were sold at a purchase price of $ 10.00
per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 3,512,500 . The Private
Units are identical to the Public Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the holders of the Private Units have agreed
not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units and the underlying securities (except to certain permitted transferees) until
the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination.
NOTE 6 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Insider Shares
On March 23, 2021, the Company issued
1,437,500
shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Insider Shares”), for an aggregate purchase price of $ 25,874 , or approximately
$ 0.018
per share. On January 4, 2022, in connection with the increase in the size of the offering, the Company declared a
20 % stock dividend
on each outstanding share. This resolution was rescinded and no additional shares were issued.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there
were
1,437,500
Insider Shares issued and outstanding. All share and per share information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect
as if the Insider Shares were issued as of the beginning of the period presented.
14
The initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer,
assign or sell any of the Insider Shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until the earlier of 180 days after the completion
of our initial business combination or the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transactions
after our initial business combination that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common
stock for cash, securities or other property.
On March 21, 2022, the Company completed the private
sale of
351,250
Private Units to the Sponsor, Ray Chen, our Chief Financial Officer, and Yongsheng Liu, our Chief Operating Officer, each
through their respective affiliated entities, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 3,512,500
(See Note 5).
Promissory Note — Related Party
On March 23, 2021, Goldenstone Holding, LLC, one
of the Company’s initial stockholders, has agreed to loan the Company up to $ 300,000
to be used for a portion of the expenses of
the Initial Public Offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of (1) September 30, 2021 or (2) the
closing of the Initial Public Offering. On January 4, 2022, the maturity date of the loan was extended to the earlier of (1) March 1,
2022 or (2) the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In March 2022, the maturity date of the loan was extended to the earlier of (1)
April 30, 2022 or (2) the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The full amount of the $ 184,126
balance was repaid on March 21, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had no borrowings under the promissory note – related party.
Working Capital Loans
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs
in connection with searching for a target business or consummating an intended initial business combination, the initial stockholders,
officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Such loans would be evidenced by promissory notes.
The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion,
up to $ 600,000
of the notes may be converted upon consummation of the Company’s business combination into private units at a price
of $ 10.00
per unit.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the
Company had no borrowings under the working capital loans.
Extensions Loans
The Company will have until 12 months from the
closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipates that it may
not be able to consummate its initial Business Combination within 12 months, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a
Business Combination up to three times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a Business Combination).
Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into
between the Company and the trustee, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate its initial Business Combination,
its sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon ten days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust
account $ 500,000 , or up to $ 575,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($ 0.10
per share in either case)
on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension (or up to an aggregate of $ 1,500,000
(or $ 1,725,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), or $ 0.30
per share if the Company extends for the full nine months).
Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loans will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of
its initial Business Combination. If the Company completes its initial Business Combination, the Company would either repay such loaned
amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to the Company, or up to $ 1,725,000
of such loans may be convertible into private
units at a price of $ 10.00
per unit at the option of the lender.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the
Company had no borrowings under the extension loans.
15
Administrative Services Agreement and Service
Fees
The Company is obligated, commencing from the
closing of the Initial Public Offering and for 12 months, to pay the sponsor’s affiliate and officers of the Company, a monthly
fee of $ 25,000
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities, secretarial support and officers’ services
to the Company. The Administrative Services Agreement and the service fees to be paid to the officers will terminate upon completion of
the Company’s Business Combination or the liquidation of the trust account to public stockholders. For the three months December
31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recognized $ 75,000
and $ 0 , respectively, of administrative service fee, which is included in formation
and operating costs on the statement of operations. For the nine months December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recognized $ 225,000
and $ 0 , respectively, of administrative service fee, which is included in formation and operating costs on the statement of operations.
Representative Shares
The Company issued
57,500
shares of Common Stock
(the “Representative Shares”) to Maxim as part of representative compensation. The Representative Shares are identical to
the Common Stock sold as part of the Public Units, except that Maxim Group LLC has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such representative
shares until the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination. In addition, Maxim Group LLC has agreed (i) to waive
its redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination
and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete
its initial Business Combination within 12 months (or up to 21 months if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business
Combination) from the effective date of its registration statement. The shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore
subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the commencement of sales of the offering pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1)
of FINRA’s Rules.
NOTE 7 — COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES
Risks and Uncertainties
Management is currently evaluating the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect
on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily
determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Registration Rights
The holders of the Insider Shares issued and outstanding
on the date of this prospectus, as well as the holders of the Private Units (and all underlying securities) and any securities our initial
stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to the Company, will be entitled
to registration rights pursuant to an agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this Initial Public Offering. The holders
of the majority of the Insider Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the
date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Units (and underlying
securities) and securities issued in payment of Working Capital Loans (or underlying securities) or loans to extend our life can elect
to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders have
certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a
Business Combination. The Company bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
16
Underwriters Agreement
The underwriters entitled to a cash underwriting
discount of
2.0 % of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $ 1,150,000 . In addition, the underwriters will be entitled to
a deferred fee of
3.5 % of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $ 2,012,500
until the closing of the Business Combination.
The deferred fee can be paid in cash, stock or a combination of both (at the underwriter’s discretion). Any stock issued as a part
of the deferred fee will be issued to the underwriters at the value per share in the Company’s Trust Account, subject to any additional
increases in the amount in trust per the Company’s trust extensions. Stock to be issued to the underwriters will have unlimited
piggyback registration rights and the same rights afforded other holders of the Company’s common stock. In addition, the Company
paid the underwriters, at closing of the Initial Public Offering,
1.0 % of the gross proceeds in the Company’s common stock or
57,500
shares of common stock.
The underwriters have agreed to waive its rights
to the deferred underwriting commission of
3.5 % of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $ 2,012,500 , held in the Trust
Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.
Unit Purchase Option
The Company also sold to Maxim, $100, a Unit Purchase
Option (“UPO”) to purchase 270,250 Units exercisable at $11.00 per Unit, an aggregate exercise price of $2,972,750, commencing
on the later of the first anniversary the effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering and the
consummation of a Business Combination. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s
option, and expires five years from the effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering. The Units
issuable upon exercise of the option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit
purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of $100 cash payment and the fair value of $208,093, or $7.67 per Unit, as an expense of the
Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The fair value of the UPO granted to Maxim was estimated
as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 12.96%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 1.61%, (3)
expected life of five years and (4) 85% probability of successful combination
The Company sold Maxim for $100, an UPO to purchase
up to 270,250 Units exercisable at $11.00 per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $2,972,750) commencing on the later of the first
anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering and the consummation of a Business
Combination. The UPO may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from the effective
date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering. The Units issuable upon exercise of the option are identical
to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of $100
cash payment and the fair value of $208,093, or $7.67 per Unit, as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly
to stockholders’ equity. The fair value of the UPO granted to Maxim was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions:
(1) expected volatility of 12.96%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 1.61%, (3) expected life of five years and (4) 85% probability of successful
combination. The option and such units purchased pursuant to the option, as well as the common stock underlying such units, the rights
included in such units, the shares of common stock that are issuable for the rights included in such units, the warrants included in such
units, and the shares underlying such warrants, have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up
pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1). Additionally, the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year
period (including the foregoing 180-day period) following the date of Initial Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer
participating in the Initial Public Offering and their bona fide officers or partners. The option grants to holders demand and “piggy
back” rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect
to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option.
The Company
will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will be paid for by
the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances
including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However,
the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price.
17
NOTE 8 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common Stock
The Company is authorized to issue up to
15,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there were
1,846,250
shares of common
stock issued and outstanding, respectively.
Rights
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there
were  5,750,000  Public Rights and  351,250  Private Rights outstanding.  Except in cases where the Company is not
the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common
stock upon consummation of its initial Business Combination. In the event the Company will not be the surviving company upon completion
of its initial Business Combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order
to receive the one-tenth (1/10) of a share underlying each right upon consummation of the Business Combination. The Company will not issue
fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or
otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware law. As a result, the holder must hold rights in multiples
of 10 in order to receive shares for all of their rights upon closing of a Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete
an initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company redeems the public shares for the funds held in the Trust
Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds for their rights and the rights will expire worthless. The Company accounted
for the
5,750,000
rights issued with the IPO as equity instruments in accordance with ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity” and ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity”. The Company accounted for
the rights as an expense of the IPO resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The Company estimates that the fair
value of the rights is approximately $ 4.4
million, or $ 0.76
per Unit, using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The fair value of
the rights is estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of
12.96 %, (2) risk-free interest
rate of
0.75 %, (3) expected life of
1
year, (4) exercise price of $ 0.00
and (5) stock price of $ 9.03 .
Warrants
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there
were  5,750,000  Public Warrants and  351,250  Private Warrants outstanding.  Each redeemable warrant entitles the
holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of common stock at a price of $ 11.50
per full share, subject to adjustment as described
in this prospectus. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial Business Combination and 12 months
from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. However, no public warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective
and current registration statement covering the issuance of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus
relating to such common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the issuance of the common stock issuable
upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within 90 days from the closing of the Company’s initial Business Combination,
warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to
maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration
under the Securities Act. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a
cashless basis. The warrants will expire
five years
from the closing of the Company’s initial Business Combination at 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time or earlier redemption.
In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional
shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the Company’s
initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $ 9.20
per share (with such issue price or effective
issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent
more than
60 % of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination,
and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the
trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Price”)
is below $ 9.20
per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to
115 % of the Market
Price, and the $ 16.50
per share redemption trigger price described below will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to
165 % of
the Market Value.
The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:
●
in whole and not in part;
●
at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
●
upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, which the Company refers to as the 30-day redemption period; and
●
if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $16.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
18
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption,
management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,”
as described in the warrant agreement. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the whole warrants for
that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock
underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value”
(defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” shall mean the average reported last sale price of the
common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the
holders of warrants.
Except as described above, no warrants will be
exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue common stock unless at the time a holder seeks to exercise such warrant, a
prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and the common stock have been registered or
qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. Under the terms of
the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current prospectus relating
to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, the Company cannot assure that
it will be able to do so and, if the Company does not maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise
of the warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their warrants and the Company will not be required to settle any such warrant exercise.
If the prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not current or if the common stock is not
qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the Company will not be required
to net cash settle or cash settle the warrant exercise, the warrants may have no value, the market for the warrants may be limited and
the warrants may expire worthless.
The private warrants have terms and provisions
that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in the Initial Public Offering except that the private warrants
will be entitled to registration rights. The private warrants (including the common stock issuable upon exercise of the private warrants)
will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination except to permitted
transferees.
The Company accounted for the
5,750,000
warrants
issued with the IPO as equity instruments in accordance with ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” and ASC 815-40,
“Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity”. The Company accounted for the warrant as an expense of
the IPO resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The Company estimates that the fair value of the warrants is approximately
$ 1.2
million, or $ 0.21
per Warrant, using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The fair value of the warrants is estimated as of the
date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of
12.96 %, (2) risk-free interest rate of
1.16 %, (3) expected life
of
5
years, (4) exercise price of $ 11.50
and (5) stock price of $ 9.03 .
NOTE 9 — INCOME TAXES
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the
Company’s deferred tax asset had a full valuation allowance recorded against it. Its effective tax rate was
39.5 % and
161.4 % for
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December
31, 2021 was
0 %. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of
21 % primarily due to the valuation allowance on the deferred
tax assets.
NOTE 10 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions
that occurred after the balance sheet date through February 21, 2023 when this unaudited condensed financial statement was issued. Based
on this review, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would require adjustment or disclosure in the unaudited condensed
financial statement.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
References to the “Company,” “Goldenstone”
“our,” “us” or “we” refer to Goldenstone Acquisition Limited. The following discussion and analysis
of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed
financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis
set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections
about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that
may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,”
“plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “continue,” or the negative of
such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to,
those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings.
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated on September
9, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
On March 21, 2022, we consummated our IPO of 5,750,000
units at $10.00 per unit (the “Units”). The units sold included the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment.
Each Unit consists of one share of our common stock (the “Public Shares”), one redeemable warrant to purchase one-half of
one share of our common stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share and one right. Each right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth
(1/10) of one share of our common stock upon the consummation of the Business Combination.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO and
the over-allotment, we consummated the issuance of 351,250 private placement units (the “Private Placement Units”) for aggregate
cash proceeds of $3,512,500. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of our common stock, one redeemable warrant to purchase
one-half of one share of our common stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share and one right. Each right entitles the holder thereof to
receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of our common stock upon the consummation of our Business Combination. Our management has broad
discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement Units, although substantially
all of the net proceeds are intended to be generally applied toward consummating our Business Combination.
Upon the closing of the initial public offering
on March 21, 2022, a total of $58,362,500 of the net proceeds from the IPO, the Over-Allotment and the Private Placement were deposited
in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders.
If we have not completed our initial business
combination within 12 months (unless extended), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly
as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash,
equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable,
and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption
will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
our initial business combination will be successful.
Results of Operations
Our entire activity since inception up to December
31, 2022 was in connection with our initial public offering and our search for a target for our initial business combination. We will
not generate any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest.
20
For the three months ended December 31, 2022,
we had a net income of $261,762, which was resulted from the interest income on the trust account of $616,020, partially offset by formation
and operating costs of $170,795, franchise tax expense of $12,343, and provision for income taxes of $171,120.
For the three months ended December 31, 2021,
we incurred a net loss of $838 which was all attributable to formation and operating costs.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we
had a net loss of $65,099, which was resulted from formation and operating costs of $718,885, franchise tax expense of $26,043, and provision
for income taxes of $171,120, partially offset by the interest income on the trust account of $850,949.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we
incurred a net loss of $15,828 which was all attributable to formation and operating costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had $279,541 in cash
in our operating account as compared to cash of $959,964 at March 31, 2022 and working capital of $74,074 as compared to working capital
of $949,866 at March 31, 2022. The decrease in liquidity is attributable to net cash used in operating activities of $680,423 for the
nine months ended December 31, 2022.
In connection with the Company’s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined
that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The management’s
plan in addressing this uncertainty is through the Working Capital Loans. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business
Combination within the Combination Period by March 20, 2023, the Company’s board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary
liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Company’s plans to consummate a Business
Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that such condition raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed financial statements does not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements
in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies
and estimates:
Common Stock Subject to Redemption
We account for our common stock subject to possible
redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value.
Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that is either within the control of the
holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as
temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption
rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock
subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section
of our balance sheet.
We have made a policy election in accordance with
ASC 480-10-S99-3A and recognizes changes in redemption value in additional paid-in capital (or accumulated deficit in the absence of additional
paid-in capital) over an expected 12-month period leading up to a Business Combination.
Deferred Offering Costs
We comply with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic
340-10-S99-1, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs – SEC Materials” (“ASC 340-10-S99”) and SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin Topic 5A, “Expenses of Offering”. Offering costs were $4,331,021 consisting principally of underwriting, legal, accounting
and other expenses that are directly related to the IPO and charged to stockholders’ equity upon the completion of the IPO.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt — “Debt with Conversion and
Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity” (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU
2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation
of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance
pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures
for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends
the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU
2020-06 is effective April 1, 2022 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning
on April 1, 2021. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 as of April 1, 2022 and did not have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited
condensed financial statements.
Management does not believe that any other recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial
statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments
and Contractual Obligations
Registration Rights
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered
into on March 17, 2022, the holders of the founder shares, the private placement units and private placement units that may be issued
upon conversion of working capital loans will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed
prior to or on the closing date of this offering requiring us to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities
are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have
certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of our
initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Underwriters Agreement
We granted the underwriters a 45-day option from
the date of the initial public offering to purchase up to an additional 750,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any at the initial
public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. This option was fully exercised at the time of the IPO.
The underwriters received a cash underwriting
discount of 2% of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or $1,150,000, upon closing of the IPO. In addition the underwriters are entitled to
a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the sale of Units in the IPO, or $2,012,500, which is currently held
in the trust account and would be payable upon the completion of the initial Business Combination subject to the terms of the underwriting
agreement.
Management does not believe that any other recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk
As smaller reporting company, we are not required
to make disclosures under this Item .
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed
with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report,
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management
evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our “Certifying Officers”),
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective, due to our management has identified a material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022. Our management has assessed that we do not have qualified personnel to be able to provide the tax provision for
a U.S. Special Purpose Acquisition Company (“SPAC”). We inadvertently taken the deduction of our operation expenses during
the quarter ended December 31, 2022, which resulted in an audit adjustment in the provision for income taxes account. Under the U.S. tax
law, expenses incurred by a SPAC before a target company is identified are generally referred to as “start-up expenses.” Start-up
expenses must be capitalized unless they qualify for an election by us to deduct up to $5,000 in the first year of such expenses and amortize
the remaining expenses over 180 months that begins with the month the active trade or business begins, or the completion of our business
combination.
We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances
of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, as
the circumstances that led to the material weakness described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q had not yet been identified. Due solely
to the audit adjustments in the provision for income taxes account, management has identified a material weakness in internal controls
related to the lack of qualified personnel to be able to provide the tax provision for a U.S. SPAC.
