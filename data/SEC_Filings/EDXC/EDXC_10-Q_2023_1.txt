Organization and Basis of Presentation
We
were incorporated under the laws of State of Nevada on September 5, 1997, as Micron Solutions. From 2002-2005, the Company operated as
Panamed Corporation, a biotech service and licensing company. Panamed Corporation merged with Visual Board Books Inc. (VBB) in February
2005 and changed the consolidated company name to Endexx Corporation (the Company).
Our
primary business is the manufacturing and sale of hemp products for personal use and pets. The Company has the following wholly owned
subsidiaries:
● Global
Solaris Group, LLC
● Greenleaf
Consulting LLC
● Cann
Can LLC
● Together
One Step Closer, LLC
● PhytoLabs
LLC
● Go
Green Global Enterprises, Inc.
● CBD
Health Solutions
● Kush,

● CBD
Life Brands, Inc.
● Retail
Pro Associates
● CBD

● Dispense
Labs LLC
● Khode,
LLC (70% owner)
Basis
of Presentation and Going Concern
The
Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board
of Directors; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. The operating results of the above listed wholly owned subsidiaries
were consolidated with the consolidated financial statements of the Company. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Our
consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have sustained operating losses since inception, which
raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
As
of December 31, 2022, we have a working capital deficit of $ 25,615,220 , and an accumulated deficit of $ 44,889,677 . During the period
ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of $ 1,246,887
and cash used in operating activities of $ 358,789 . The Company’s ability
to continue in existence is dependent on its ability to develop additional sources of capital, and/or achieve profitable operations and
positive cash flows. Management’s plans with respect to operations include the sustained and aggressive marketing of hemp cannabidiol
products and raising additional capital through sales of equity or debt securities as may be necessary to pursue its business plans and
sustain operations until such time as the Company can achieve profitability. Management believes that aggressive marketing combined with
additional financing as necessary will result in improved operations and cash flow in 2023 and beyond. However, there can be no assurance
that management will be successful in obtaining additional funding or in attaining profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America and the interim reporting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s latest Annual Report
filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments (unless otherwise
indicated), necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented
have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year.
Use
of Estimates
The
Company’s financial statement preparation requires that management make estimates and assumptions which affect the reporting of
assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in order to report these financial statements
in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash
Cash
includes all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities at the date
of purchase of three months or less. There were
no
cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable consists of invoiced and unpaid product sales. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts to allow for any amounts
that may not be recoverable, which is based on an analysis of the Company’s prior collection experience, customer credit worthiness,
and current economic trends. Accounts are considered delinquent when payments have not been received within the agreed upon terms and
are written off when management determines that collection is not probable.
At
December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we recorded $ 58,257 , respectively, for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon management’s
review of accounts receivable.
Inventory
Inventory
is composed of finished goods, in-process, and raw goods inventory, valued on a first in first out basis, and includes production cost,
product freight in, and packaging costs. Slow moving and obsolete inventories are written down based on a comparison of on-hand quantities
to historical and projected usages.
The
Company has authorized a consignment inventory arrangement with one of its mass retail customers. After consignment inventory has been
sold by this customer, the customer notifies the Company of the sale and the Company records revenue in that accounting period. The Company
authorizes the replenishment of consignment inventory based on orders placed by the customer. The Company is provided with weekly reports
of consignment sales activity and balances.

ENDEXX CORPORATION AND

Prepaid
Expenses
The
Company considers all items incurred for future services to be prepaid expenses. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the
Company had $ 264,560
and $ 279,560 , respectively, of future professional and advertising services to be received through the year ended
September 30, 2023.
During
March 2020, the Company entered into a barter agreement whereby it delivered $ 249,560
of its inventory in exchange for future advertising
credits. The credits, which expire in March 2023, are valued at the lower of the Company’s cost of market value of the inventory
transferred. Under the terms of the barter agreement, the Company is required to pay cash equal to a negotiated amount of the bartered
advertising and use the barter credits to pay the balance. These credits are charged to expense as they are used. As of December 31,
2022, none of the barter credits have been used and have been recorded as current assets on the accompanying financial statements.
The
Company assesses the recoverability of barter credits periodically. Factors considered in evaluating the recoverability include management’s
plans with respect to advertising for which barter credits can be used. Any impairment losses are charged to operations as they are determinable.
During the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded no impairment losses related to barter credits.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as
incurred. Depreciation and amortization are based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts,
and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations in the period realized.
Depreciation
is computed on the straight-line method net of salvage value with useful lives as follows:
Schedule
of Property and Equipment Useful Lives
Computer
equipment and software
5 years
Business
equipment and fixtures
7 years
Property
and buildings
39 years
Recoverability
of Long-Lived Assets
The
Company reviews its long-lived assets on a periodic basis, whenever events and changes in circumstances have occurred which may indicate
a possible impairment. The assessment for potential impairment will be based primarily on the Company’s ability to recover the
carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future cash flows from its operations on an undiscounted basis. If such assets
are determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value
of the assets. Fixed assets to be disposed of by sale will be carried at the lower of the then current carrying value or fair value less
estimated costs to sell.
We
amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed
indefinite. During the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded
no
impairment charges related to other intangible assets.
Customer
Deposits
From
time-to-time the Company receives payment from wholesale customers in advance of delivering products to the customer. All such deposits
are short term in nature as the Company delivers the product, unfulfilled portions, or engineering services to the customer before the
end of its next annual fiscal period. These deposits are credited to the customer against product deliveries or at the completion of
the customer’s order.

Revenue
Recognition
Revenue
is recognized from the sale of hemp products when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution
and sales of hemp products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred.
The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return
after 30 days from the date of purchase. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and
subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
In
accordance with the reporting requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) Topic 825, Financial Instruments, the Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify
as financial instruments under this standard and includes this additional information in the notes to the financial statements when the
fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. The Company does not have assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis except its derivative liability.
Consequently,
the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at the balance sheet dates, nor
gains or losses reported in the statements of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to
those assets and liabilities still held during the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, except as disclosed.
Convertible
Instruments
The
Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives
and Hedging Activities.
Applicable
GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative
financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and
risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host
contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at
fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same
terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.
The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has been determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) as follows: The Company records when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of
conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the
commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements
are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.
Beneficial
Conversion Features
ASC
470-20 applies to convertible securities with beneficial conversion features that must be settled in stock and to those that give the
issuer a choice in settling the obligation in either stock or cash. ASC 470-20 requires that the beneficial conversion feature should
be valued at the commitment date as the difference between the conversion price and the fair market value of the common stock into which
the security is convertible, multiplied by the number of shares into which the security is convertible. This amount is recorded as a
debt discount and amortized over the life of the debt. ASC 470-20 further limits this amount to the proceeds allocated to the convertible
instrument.
Research
and development costs
Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and are included in operating expenses. Total research and development costs
were $ 3,062
and $ 2,351
for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Costs

expense were $ 93,945
and $ 323,648
for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the liability method of accounting. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined
based on differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates in effect in years in which
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that
are expected to be realized.
The
Company follows ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This interpretation requires recognition and measurement of uncertain
income tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” approach. The Company evaluates its tax positions on an annual basis,
and as of December 31, 2022, no additional accrual for income taxes is necessary. The Company’s policy is to recognize both interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits expected to result in payment of cash within one year are classified as accrued liabilities,
while those expected beyond one year are classified as other liabilities. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties since
its inception. The Company is required to file income tax returns in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction and in various state tax jurisdictions
and the prior three fiscal years remain open for examination by federal and/or state tax jurisdictions. The Company is currently not
under examination by any other tax jurisdictions for any tax year.
Share
Based Compensation
The
Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of the FASB ASC No. 718 and No.
505. The Company issues restricted stock to employees for their services. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value
of the equity instruments issued at the date of grant. These shares are considered fully vested and the fair market value is recognized
as expense in the period granted. The Company also issues restricted stock to consultants for various services. Costs for these transactions
are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable. The value of the common stock is measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm commitment only if there is sufficient
disincentive to ensure performance or (ii) the date at which the counterparty’s performance is complete. The Company recognized
consulting expenses and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital related to stock issued for services. For agreements requiring
future services, the consulting expense is to be recognized ratably over the requisite service period.
(Loss)
Income Per Share of Common Stock
Basic
net loss/income per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share
(EPS) include additional dilution from common stock equivalents, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options, warrants
and convertible notes. Common stock equivalents are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share when the Company reports
a loss because to do so would be anti-dilutive for periods presented.
The
Company had total potential additional dilutive securities outstanding at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, as follows.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
During
the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB. Each of the other
pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting
pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Contingencies
Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only
be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and legal counsel assess such contingent
liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the
perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought.
If
the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be
estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements.
If
the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot
be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and
material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve
guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.

Commitments and Contingencies
Serious
Promotions, Inc.
In
June 2022, Serious Promotions, Inc. filed a Petition before the American Arbitration Association seeking monetary damages against Khode,
LLC, a joint venture entered into by Serious Promotions and the Company. Serious Promotions alleges that Khode failed to make certain
payments of fees related to the Endorsement and License Agreement entered into by Serious Promotions and its president Khaled Mohamed
Khaled (p/k/a DJ Khaled). Serious Promotions seeks $ 6,250,000
in damages.
In
July 2022, Khode, joined as a party by the Company, filed counterclaims against Serious Promotions, Khaled and Impact Brokers for breach
of the Endorsement and License Agreement and related violations of legal duties, seeking damages in an amount no less than $ 100,000,000 .
Although
this arbitration is in its early stages, the Company is confident in its position, will vigorously defend its position, and prosecute
its counterclaims, and ultimately expects rulings in its favor.
Contracts

Equity Method Investment and Note Receivable
Hyla
US Holdco Limited
Effective
August 31, 2022, the Company closed the transactions (the “Hyla Transaction Closing Date”) contemplated by a Control Acquisition
Agreement (the “Hyla Acquisition Agreement”) with HYLA UK Holdco Limited, a United Kingdom limited company (the “Seller”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Hyla Acquisition Agreement, we purchased (the “Hyla Transaction”)
51 % of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Hyla US Holdco Limited, a Delaware corporation (“Hyla”), a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Seller.
We
issued to the Seller
4,878,049
shares of our newly constituted Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Hyla Series H Preferred”).
We valued those shares at an aggregate of $ 2,000,000 , which was based upon an as-converted-into-our Common Stock value of $ 0.041
per
share. The per-share price was the closing price of our Common Stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share (our “Common Stock”), as
reported by the OTC Markets Group Inc. (the “OTCM”), on August 19, 2022, the date on which certain of the initial set of
Hyla Transaction-related draft documents were circulated for signature.
As
of September 30, 2022, the Company did not control Hyla and recorded an equity method investment for $ 2,000,000
at December 31, 2022
and September 30, 2022.
Additionally,
as part of the Hyla Acquisition Agreement, when the Company establishes control of Hyla, the Company is obligated to pay to the Seller
a Self-financing Promissory Note (our “Self-financing Note”) with a term of up to
nine years . The initial principal balance
of the Self-financing Note is $ 8,000,000
and it bears interest at an annual simple interest rate of
3.15 %, which is the Internal Revenue
Service’s August 2022 Applicable Federal Rate for promissory notes with terms from three to nine years. Upon an Event of Default
(as such term is defined in the Self-financing Note), the interest rate will increase to 6.3% per annum until such Event of Default has
been cured or the debt has been paid in full. Under the Note, the Company will be obligated to make payments of principal and interest
on a quarterly basis, in arrears (each, a “Quarterly Payment”). The amount of principal and interest due to the Seller for
each of our Quarterly Payments is calculated pursuant to a formula set forth in the Self-financing Note, the components of which are
derived from a matrix that consists of Hyla’s quarterly gross sales revenues and its gross sales margin. Each Quarterly Payment
shall, at the option of the Seller, be paid either in cash or through the issuance of shares of our Common Stock. The pricing of those
shares will be determined by the volume weighted average price of our Common Stock as of the last business day of the relevant quarter.
The Self-financing Note is subject to an “ownership limitation” such that the Seller cannot request that it be issued shares
of our Common Stock as payment if such issuance would result in the Seller holding more than 4.99% of the then-issued and outstanding
shares of our Common Stock (a “Conversion or Exercise Blocker” ). We may pre-pay our Self-financing Note in whole or in part
at any time without premium or penalty.
In
connection with the Hyla Transaction, Hyla and we entered into an Intercompany Services Agreement (the “Hyla ISA”), pursuant
to the provisions of which, we agreed to provide to Hyla certain human resources, marketing, information technology, and other administrative
services that are necessary to support its business. We will invoice Hyla on a monthly basis for our performance of the services thereunder,
and for which Hyla will pay us in accordance with the provisions of the HYLA ISA. The initial term of the Hyla ISA is nine years and
it is subject to renewal for successive 12-month periods.
In
connection with the Hyla ISA, Hyla issued to us its two-year Promissory Note in the principal amount of $ 1,500,000 , which accrues interest
at the rate of
10 % per annum (“Hyla’s ISA Note”). Principal and interest payments thereunder are due and payable monthly.
Upon an Event of Default (as such term is defined in Hyla’s ISA Note), the interest rate increases to
18 % per annum until such
Event of Default has been cured or the debt has been paid in full. The principal amount is due and payable on or before August 31, 2024.

Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
For
a description of our significant accounting policies and an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance
during the three months ended December 31, 2021, this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” (hereafter referred to as “MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated

Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”).
Note
about Forward-Looking Statements
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that constitute “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements
are often characterized by the terms “may,” “believes,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,”
“expects,” or “anticipates,” and do not reflect historical facts.
Specific
forward-looking statements contained in this portion of the Quarterly Report include, but are not limited to: (i) statements that are
based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate, (ii) statements about current projections and expectations

relating to our future operations, prospects, results, and performance, and (v) statements that the cash on hand and additional cash
generated from operations together with potential sources of cash through issuance of debt or equity will provide the Company with sufficient
liquidity for the next 12 months.
Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially
different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors and risks that could affect our results, future
performance and capital requirements and cause them to materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include
those identified in our Registration Statement on Form 10 under Item 1A “Risk Factors”, as well as other factors that we
are currently unable to identify or quantify, but that may exist in the future.
In
addition, the foregoing factors may generally affect our business, results of operations and financial position. Forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date the statements were made. We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements. Any information contained on our website:

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical financial information, the following
discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions,
such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical information
and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results, or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based upon
estimates, forecasts, and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties, and
contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change.
These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in any forward-looking statements made by us, or on our behalf. We disclose any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Our
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result
of a number of factors, including those discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Item 1. Overview,” and
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” sections in this Report. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,”
“project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,”
“may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking
statements.
Overview
We
develop hemp-derived, cannabidiol-based products, each formulated to address key segments of the health and wellness market. Through
our subsidiaries, we sell high-end, full-spectrum hemp-derived oils, extracts, topicals, and pet products, all with the shared purpose
of supporting the potential of relief of pain and inflammation for humans and pets, through our e-commerce site
www.cbdunlimited.com ,
as well as other online and in-store retailers. In addition to our consumer products, our Gorilla-Tek division offers a state-of the
art automated dispensing system providing a secure method of distributing hemp-based products. The proprietary system enables retailers
to increase sales channels without opening a physical storefront location. Complementing our retail products and Gorilla-Tek divisions,
we also own and operate a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries that offer technology and consulting solutions to the hemp and CBD industry,
including an easy to use “Seed-to-Shelf” compliance and inventory tracking and process management system for regulated products
in a front of counter pharmacy support platform.
The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 1997 as Micron Solutions in order to complete a merger with Shillelagh.
In November 1997, Shillelagh merged with and into Micron Solutions, with Micron Solutions as the surviving entity. In 2002, Micron Solutions
entered into the Exchange Agreement with PanaMed, Inc., and all of its shareholders, pursuant to which PanaMed, Inc. became the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the Exchange Agreement, Micron also changed its name to PanaMed Corporation.
In
June 2005, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change
our name to Endexx Corporation. At that time, we adopted our current trading symbol, “EDXC.” In September 2005, PanaMed Corporation
acquired VBB, and SaaS provider, through a merger, whereby VBB merged with and into us, and we were the surviving entity. Subsequently,
we operated as a diversified technology and SaaS and compliance and tracking systems company, until we shifted our focus to the hemp-derived
product industry in August 2014. In October 2018, we changed our name to CBD Unlimited, Inc., and in May 2020, we changed our name back
to Endexx Corporation, with CBD Unlimited, Inc., becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. On January 25, 2021, we filed our Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation.

Results
of Operations
Three
Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended and December 31, 2021
Revenues
Revenues
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $320,369, as compared to $274,591 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a $45,778
(or 96.4%) increase in revenues. The improvement in revenue for period ended December 31, 2022 is partly attributable to improved market
conditions, new sales channels and improved marketing efforts in promoting the Company’s products.
We
expect an increase in commercial revenue over the next 12 months as our business model is implemented and expanded and our commercial
and retail accounts continue to grow and expand the products being sold in each of their retail locations. Additionally, we will continue
to focus on the development of both current and new products while continuing to commercialize existing products lines.
Gross
Profit (Loss)
Gross
profit (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was a profit of $242,323, as compared to a profit of $16,255 for the three
months ended December 31, 2021. The improvement in gross profit was attributable to increased revenues and decreased inventory impairment.
Operating
Expenses
Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 31, 2022, were $720,817, as compared to $1,440,197 for the three months ended December
31, 2021, an improvement of $719,380. The decrease in operating expenses over the prior period can be attributed to significant decreases
in advertising expenses.
We
expect that operating expenses will continue to decrease over the next 12 months as our long-term growth strategy will require significant
changes in personnel and facilities, offset increased research and development expenses to ensure that products nearing commercialization
are brought to market as quickly and as effectively. We cannot provide any assurances that our strategy will be effective.
5
Other
Expense
Other
expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $768,393, as compared to other expense of $223,263 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021, a $545,130 quarter over quarter increase. This is the result of one time changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities
and gains on settlements recorded in the period ending December 31, 2021. Derivative liabilities are associated with loans that are convertible
and have variable pricing on the equivalent shares of Common Stock. At the end of each period, these derivative liabilities are valued,
and the net change is recorded as a gain or loss in other expense and income.
Loss
from Operations and Total Net Loss
Loss
from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $478,494, as compared to loss from operations of $1,423,942 for the
three months ended December 31, 2021, an improvement in net loss from operations of $945,448. The decrease in loss from operations for
the period ended December 31, 2022 was the result of (i) an increase in gross revenues, (ii) a marginally lower increase in cost of revenues,
and (iii) a decrease in inventory impairment, and (iv) a decrease in total operating expenses.
Total
net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $1,246,887, as compared to a total net loss of $1,647,205 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021, an improvement of $400,318 in total net loss. The decrease in total net loss for the period ended December 31,
2022 was as a result of decreased operating expenses, lower interest expenses and gains in default penalties. Derivative liabilities
are associated with loans that are convertible and have variable pricing on the equivalent shares of Common Stock. At the end of each
period, these derivative liabilities are valued, and the net change is recorded as a gain or loss in other expense and income.
We
do not expect to realize net income in the near term as anticipated operational expenses are expected to increase as a result of increased
research and development expenses, consulting fees, payroll expenses, and administrative costs as staffing increases. Despite management’s
focus on ensuring operating efficiencies, we expect to continue to operate at a loss through fiscal 2023 only in part due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Nevertheless, we expect that, during our current fiscal year, the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business will slowly abate,
as the positivity rate in tests for COVID-19 continues to decrease along with the new infection and mortality rates and the number of
people becoming vaccinated continues to increase.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources – Three Months Ended December 31, 2022
Going
Concern
We
have incurred operating losses since inception and have negative cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had a stockholders’
deficit of $9,233,111, a working capital deficit of $9,615,220, and we incurred an accumulated deficit of $44,889,677 and incurred a
net loss of $1,246,887 in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, we utilized $359,520 in cash during the three months
ended December 31, 2022, while we used $731 in cash related to financing activities. As a result, our continuation as a going concern
is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing until we can generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations.
We intend to continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to continue our operations, but there can be no assurance that such
financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies we may not continue to meet our obligations
and continue our operations for the next fiscal year. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability
to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until we begin generating positive cash flow.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had a cash position of $5,642. We estimate our operating expenses for the near- and mid-term may continue to
exceed the revenues that we may generate, and we may need to raise capital through either debt or equity offerings to continue operations.
We are in the early stages of our business. We are required to fund growth from financing activities, and we intend to rely on a combination
of equity and debt financings. Due to market conditions and the early stage of our operations, there is considerable risk that we will
not be able to raise such financings at all, or on terms that are not overly dilutive to our existing stockholders. We can offer no assurance
that we will be able to raise such funds. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all of our planned operations, we may be
forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations,
including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and we may be
forced to reduce or discontinue operations.
There
is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing will be available to us in the amounts, on terms, and
at times deemed acceptable to us, if at all. The issuance of additional equity securities by us would result in a significant dilution
in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase
our liabilities and future cash commitments. If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable to us,
we may be unable to continue our business, as planned, and as a result may be required to scale back or cease operations for our business,
the result of which would be that our stockholders would lose some or all of their investment. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Cash
Flow – Operating Activities
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our cash used in operating activities amounted to an outflow of $358,789, compared to cash
used during the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $945,911.The decrease in cash used in our operating activities is due to changes
in our inventory value, prepaid expenses, accounts receivable, and accrued interest on notes payable.
Cash
Flow – Financing Activities
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our cash used by financing activities amounted to $731, which includes $0 in proceeds received
from the issuances of our Common Stock, $0 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, $0 in proceeds from the issuance of notes
payable and $731 used for the repayment of notes payable.
6
For
the three months ended December 31, 2021, our cash provided by financing activities amounted to $1,116,833, which includes $0 in proceeds
received from the issuances of our Common Stock and $999,853 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and $116,833 in proceeds
from the issuance of notes payable.
Cash
Flow – Investing Activities
Net
cash used in investing activities in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $0, compared to net cash used in investing activities
in the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $0.
Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Account Receivable
Accounts
receivable are recorded at net realizable value. We determine provisions for uncollectible accounts, sales returns, and claims based
upon factors including the credit risk and activity of specific distributors and resellers, historical trends, and other information.
If we become aware of a specific distributor’s or reseller’s inability to meet its financial obligations, bad debt charges
are recorded based on an overall assessment of past due accounts receivable outstanding. In the opinion of management, a provision was
deemed necessary for uncollectible accounts.
Inventory
The
cost of inventory using the standard cost method, which approximates actual cost based on a first-in, first-out method. Our inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Our inventory consists almost entirely of finished and unfinished goods, and
freight, which include CBD creams, oils, capsules, and sprays. We periodically evaluate and adjust inventories for obsolescence. In the
opinion of management, no provision for obsolescence is deemed necessary. The shelf life of all product inventory is two years, and as
of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $730,532 of product in inventory, which was a decrease of approximately $47,379, compared
to approximately $777,911 at September 30, 2022. We expect the balance of inventory to increase in direct relation to the increase in
sales that we expect.
Goodwill
and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus
the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed
as of the acquisition date. Goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are
not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a
goodwill impairment test should be performed. We have selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test.
Intangible
assets represent both indefinite lived and definite lived assets. Trademarks are deemed to have definite useful lives of ten years, are
amortized, and are tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets are reported on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortization.
We have selected September 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test.
Stock-Based
Compensation
FASB’s
ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation (formerly, FASB Statement 123R), prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based
payment transactions in which employee and non-employee services are acquired. We measure the cost of employee and non-employee services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Fair value for restricted stock
awards is valued using the closing price of our Common Stock on the date of grant. For our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, we recognized
stock-based compensation expense of approximately $455,800, and $721,021, respectively.
Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements
As
of December 31, 2022 and on September 30, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and
assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions.

3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As
a Smaller Reporting Company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure control and Procedures . We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, the period covered in this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended December 31, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected.
These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Item
1. Legal Proceedings
Except
as set forth below, we know of no material pending legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or to which any
of our assets or properties, or the assets or properties of any of our subsidiaries, are subject and, to the best of our knowledge, no
adverse legal activity is anticipated or threatened. In addition, we do not know of any such proceedings contemplated by any governmental
authorities.
In
June 2022, Serious Promotions, Inc. filed a Petition before the American Arbitration Association seeking monetary damages against Khode,
LLC, a joint venture entered into by Serious Promotions and us (“Khode”). Serious Promotions alleges that Khode failed to
make certain payments of fees related to the Endorsement and License Agreement entered into by Serious Promotions and its president Khaled
Mohamed Khaled (p/k/a DJ Khaled). Serious Promotions seeks $6,250,000 in damages. In July 2022, Khode, joined as a party by us, filed
counterclaims against Serious Promotions, Khaled, and Impact Brokers for breach of the Endorsement and License Agreement and related
violations of legal duties, seeking damages in an amount no less than $100,000,000. Although this arbitration is in its early stages,
the Company is confident in its position, will vigorously defend its position, and prosecute its counterclaims, and ultimately expects
rulings in its favor.
We
know of no material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers, or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder is
a party adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries.
