Greystone
Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
Note
1.
Basis of Financial Statements
In
the opinion of Greystone Logistics, Inc. (“Greystone”), the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
contain all adjustments and reclassifications, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly its financial
position as of November 30, 2022, the results of its operations for the six months and three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021
and its changes in equity and cash flows for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. These consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended May
31, 2022 and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K for such period. The results of operations for the six months and three
months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal
year.
The
consolidated financial statements of Greystone include its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greystone Manufacturing, L.L.C. (“GSM”)
and Plastic Pallet Production, Inc. (“PPP”), and the variable interest entity, Greystone Real Estate, L.L.C. (“GRE”)
for the period from June 1, 2022 through July 29, 2022. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements.
GRE,
which is wholly-owned by a member of Greystone’s Board of Directors, owns two primary manufacturing facilities which are occupied
by Greystone. Effective July 29, 2022, GRE paid off its mortgage payable and, in conjunction with Greystone’s refinancing described
in Note 6, GRE was removed from the cross-collateralization in the loan agreement between Greystone and International Bank of Commerce.
Following these transactions, Greystone was no longer determined to be the primary beneficiary of GRE. Accordingly, GRE was deconsolidated
from Greystone’s consolidated financial statements as of July 29, 2022, resulting in the recognition of a gain in the amount of
$ 569,997 . Subsequent to the deconsolidation, Greystone entered into a new lease agreement with the related party and recorded right of
use assets and liabilities for the new lease, see Note 7.
Note
2.
Earnings Per Share
Basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing
net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares used
in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of
all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.
6
Greystone
excludes equity instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect of including such instruments is anti-dilutive.
Instruments which have an anti-dilutive effect for the periods ended November 30 are as follows:

Restated
and Amended Loan Agreement between Greystone and IBC
On
July 29, 2022, Greystone and GSM (collectively “Borrowers”) and IBC entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (“IBC
Restated Loan Agreement”) that provides for consolidation of certain term loans and a renewed revolver loan.
The
IBC term loans make equal monthly payments of principal and interest in such amounts sufficient to amortize the principal balance of
the loans over the remaining lives. The monthly payments of principal and interest on the IBC term loans may vary due to changes in the
prime rate of interest. Currently, the aggregate payments for the IBC term loans are approximately $ 231,000
per month.
The
IBC Restated Loan Agreement provides for IBC to make to Greystone (i) a term loan in the amount of $ 7,854,708 , Term Loan A, to consolidate
all existing term loans in the aggregate amount of $ 2,669,892
with Lender, extend credit in the amount of $ 3,271,987
to pay off a note
payable to Robert B. Rosene, Jr. and extend additional credit to fund the purchase in the amount of $ 1,912,829
of the equipment subject
to the iGPS Logistics, LLC, leases and (ii) an advancing term loan facility, Term Loan B, whereby Greystone may obtain advances up to
the aggregate amount of $ 7,000,000
(items i and ii referred to as “Term Loans”) (iii) a renewal of the revolving loan with
an increase of $ 2,000,000
to an aggregate principal amount of $ 6,000,000
(the “Revolving Loan”), subject to borrowing base
limitations. As of November 30, 2022, Greystone’s available revolving loan borrowing capacity was approximately $ 1,252,000 .
The
IBC Restated Loan Agreement includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to non-payment of principal and
other amounts owing under the IBC Restated Loan Agreement from time to time, inaccuracy of representations, violation of covenants, defaults
under other agreements, bankruptcy and similar events, the death of a guarantor, certain material adverse changes relating to a Borrower
or guarantor, certain judgments or awards against a Borrower, or government action affecting a Borrower’s or guarantor’s
ability to perform under the IBC Restated Loan Agreement or the related loan documents. Among other things, a default under the IBC Restated
Loan Agreement would permit IBC to cease lending funds under the IBC Restated Loan Agreement and require immediate repayment of any outstanding
notes with interest and any unpaid accrued fees.
The
IBC Restated Loan Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all assets of the Borrowers. Warren F. Kruger, President and CEO, and
Robert B. Rosene, Jr. have provided limited guaranties of the Borrowers’ obligations under the IBC Restated Loan Agreement. Mr.
Kruger’s guarantee is limited to
32.4 % of all debt obligations to IBC. Mr. Rosene’s limited guaranty is the lesser of (i)
$ 3,500,000
less all amounts paid on the principal amount of the loans after the date of the agreement excluding payments on the revolver
and (ii) the amount owed to IBC of the loans outstanding from time to time including accrued interest and fees.
Loan
Agreement with First Interstate Bank, formerly Great Western Bank
On
August 23, 2021, Greystone entered into a loan agreement with First Interstate Bank (“FIB Loan Agreement”) to include prior
commercial loans and subsequent loans. GSM is a named guarantor under the FIB Loan Agreement.
The
FIB Loan Agreement includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to non-payment of principal and other amounts
owing under the FIB Loan Agreement from time to time, inaccuracy of representations, violation of covenants, defaults under other agreements,
bankruptcy and similar events, certain material adverse changes relating to a Borrower, certain judgments or awards against a Borrower,
or guarantor’s ability to perform under the FIB Loan Agreement. Among other things, a default under the FIB Loan Agreement would
permit FIB to cease lending funds under the FIB Loan Agreement and require immediate repayment of any outstanding notes with interest
and any unpaid accrued fees.
The
FIB Loan Agreement is secured by a mortgage on one of Greystone’s warehouses.

that approximates the rate of interest for a collateralized loan over a similar term. A right-of-use asset is recognized for each lease,
valued at the lease liability. Minimum fixed rental payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease as costs
and expenses on the consolidated statements of income. Variable and short-term rental payments are recognized as costs and expenses as
they are incurred.

Concentrations, Risks and Uncertainties
Greystone
derived approximately
73 % and
74 % of its total sales from three customers
during the six months
ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The loss of a material amount of business from one or more of these customers could have
a material adverse effect on Greystone.
Greystone
purchases damaged pallets from its customers at a price based on the value of the raw material content in the pallet. A majority of these
purchases, totaling $ 313,050
and $ 524,321
in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, were from one of its major customers.
Greystone
is subject to litigation, claims and other commitments and contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the asserted
value of these matters may be significant, the company currently does not expect that the ultimate resolution of any open matters will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Commitments
As
of November 30, 2022, Greystone had commitments totaling $ 5,065,888

Results
of Operations
General
to All Periods
The
unaudited consolidated statements include Greystone Logistics, Inc., and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greystone Manufacturing,
L.L.C. (“GSM”) and Plastic Pallet Production, Inc. (“PPP”). Greystone also consolidates the variable interest
entity, Greystone Real Estate, L.L.C. (“GRE”) for the period from June 1, 2022 through July 29, 2022. Effective July 29,
2022, the relationship of Greystone as a beneficiary of GRE ceased to exist. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.
References
to fiscal year 2023 refer to the six months and three months ended November 30, 2022. References to fiscal year 2022 refer to the six
months and three months ended November 30, 2021.
Sales
Greystone’s
primary focus is to provide quality plastic pallets to its existing customers while continuing its marketing efforts to broaden its customer
base. Greystone’s existing customers are primarily located in the United States and engaged in the beverage, pharmaceutical and
other industries. Greystone has generated, and plans to continue to generate, interest in its pallets by attending trade shows sponsored
by industry segments that would benefit from Greystone’s products. Greystone hopes to gain wider product acceptance by marketing
the concept that the widespread use of plastic pallets could greatly reduce the destruction of trees on a worldwide basis. Greystone’s
marketing is conducted through contract distributors, its President and other employees.
Personnel
Greystone
had full-time-equivalents of approximately 195 and 264 full-time employees and 40 and 73 temporary employees as of November 30, 2022
and 2021, respectively. Full-time equivalent is a measure based on time worked.
Six
Months Ended November 30, 2022 Compared to Six Months Ended November 30, 2021
Sales
Sales
for fiscal year 2023 were $31,055,273 compared to $30,618,966 in fiscal year 2022 for an increase of $436,307, or 1.4%. While the quantity
of pallets sold in fiscal year 2023 decreased by approximately 13% from the prior period, the average price of pallets sold increased
by approximately 15%. The increase in the average price of pallets sold during the current period is the result of product mix and price
increases.
Greystone
had three customers which accounted for approximately 73% and 74% of sales in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Greystone is
not able to predict the future needs of these major customers and will continue its efforts to grow sales through the addition of new
customers developed through Greystone’s marketing efforts.
Cost
of Sales
Cost
of sales in fiscal year 2023 was $27,369,753, or 88% of sales, compared to $28,179,906, or 92% of sales, in fiscal year 2022. The decrease
in cost of sales to sales in fiscal year 2023 from the prior period was primarily the result of selling price increases as noted under
Sales
and the cost control measures implemented by Greystone to offset the impact of lower pallet production. Greystone’s
inflexible costs of production are a significant factor impacting the profit margins realized from the sale of product. While cost of
sales to sales showed improvements over the prior period, Greystone anticipates continued improvements during the remainder of the current
year as increases are anticipated in pallet production.
14
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses
Selling,
general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $2,311,579, or 7.4% of sales, in fiscal year 2023 compared to $2,352,504, or 7.7%
of sales, in fiscal year 2022 for a decrease of $(40,925). SG&A during the current period compared to the prior period shows general
consistency.
Other
Income (Expenses)
During
fiscal year 2023, Greystone recognized a gain on the deconsolidation of the variable interest entity GRE in the amount of $569,997. During
fiscal year 2022, a gain was recognized on the forgiveness of debt plus accrued interest in the amount of $3,068,497 for the Paycheck
Protection Program loan under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
Other
income was $6,318 in fiscal year 2023 and $32,043 in fiscal year 2022 from the sale of scrap material and a gain on the sale of assets
in the prior period.
Interest
expense was $507,762 in fiscal year 2023 compared to $429,123 in fiscal year 2022 for an increase of $78,639. The increase is attributable
to increases in the prime rate of interest which was 7.00% as of November 30, 2022 compared to 3.25% as November 30, 2021.
Provision
for Income Taxes
The
provision for (benefit from) income taxes was $256,000 and $(135,000) in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax
rate differs from federal statutory rates principally due to state income taxes, charges or income which have no tax benefit or expense,
changes in the valuation allowance, and the basis that net income from GRE is not taxable at the corporate level because GRE is a limited
liability company of which Greystone has no equity ownership.
Based
upon a review of its income tax filing positions, Greystone believes that its positions would be sustained upon an audit by the Internal
Revenue Service and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore,
no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.
Net
Income
Greystone
recorded net income of $1,186,494 in fiscal year 2023 compared to $2,892,973 in fiscal year 2022 primarily for the reasons discussed
above.
Net
Income Attributable to Common Stockholders
The
net income attributable to common stockholders (net income less preferred dividends and GRE’s net income) for fiscal year 2023
was $908,128, or $0.03 per share, compared $2,592,077, or $0.09 per share, in fiscal year 2022 primarily for the reasons discussed above.
15
Three
Months Ended November 30, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended November 30, 2021
Sales
Sales
for fiscal year 2023 were $12,101,674 compared to $15,844,567 in fiscal year 2022 for a decrease of $(3,742,893). This decrease in sales
from fiscal year 2022 was principally the result of a decrease of approximately 27% in the quantity of pallets sold offset somewhat by
an increase of approximately 5% in the average price per pallet sold.
Greystone
had three customers which accounted for approximately 66% and 78% of sales in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Greystone is
not able to predict the future needs of these major customers and will continue its efforts to grow sales through the addition of new
customers developed through Greystone’s marketing efforts.
Cost
of Sales
Cost
of sales in fiscal year 2023 was $10,879,300, or 90% of sales, compared to $14,867,601, or 94% of sales, in fiscal year 2022. The decrease
in cost of sales to sales in fiscal year 2023 from the prior period was primarily the result of selling price increases as noted under
Sales
and cost control measures implemented by Greystone to offset the impact of lower pallet production during the current period.
Greystone’s inflexible costs of production are a significant factor impacting the profit margins realized from the sale of product.
While cost of sales to sales showed improvements over the prior period, Greystone anticipates continued improvements during the remainder
of the current year as increases are anticipated in pallet production.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses
Selling,
general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1,205,988, or 10.0% of sales, in fiscal year 2023 compared to $1,133,900, or 7.2%
of sales, in fiscal year 2022 for an increase of $72,088. SG&A costs during the current period compared to the prior period showed
general consistency. The increase in the percent of SG&A to sales results from the decline of sales in the current period.

income from sales of scrap material was $683 in fiscal year 2023 compared to $5,218 in fiscal year 2022.
Interest
expense was $288,316 in fiscal year 2023 compared to $205,769 in fiscal year 2022 for an increase of $82,547. The increase is attributable
to increases in the prime rate of interest which was 7.00% as of November 30, 2022 compared to 3.25% as November 30, 2021.
Provision
for Income Taxes
The
benefit from income taxes was $84,000 and $128,000 in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from federal
statutory rates due principally to state income taxes, charges or income which have no tax benefit or expense, changes in the valuation
allowance, and the basis that the net income from GRE is not taxable at the corporate level because GRE is a limited liability company
of which Greystone has no equity ownership.
Based
upon a review of its income tax filing positions, Greystone believes that its positions would be sustained upon an audit by the Internal
Revenue Service and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore,
no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.

Greystone
had a working capital of $2,811,905 as of November 30, 2022. To provide for the funding to meet Greystone’s operating activities
and contractual obligations as of November 30, 2022, Greystone will have to continue to produce positive operating results or explore
various options including additional long-term debt and equity financing. However, there is no guarantee that Greystone will continue
to create positive operating results or be able to raise sufficient capital to meet these obligations.
By
notice dated January 9, 2023, the Department of Treasury notified Greystone of Employee Retention Credits awarded under the CARES Act
in the total amount of approximately $3,270,000 due to Greystone for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Greystone
anticipates the receipt of these funds during its fiscal third quarter 2023, and plans to use the funds to improve its working capital,
reduce debt, and cover portions of our unfinanced commitments.
As
of November 30, 2022, Greystone had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately $5.0 million of which $3.5 million is available
under the advancing term loan with IBC, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
17
A
substantial amount of the Greystone’s debt financing has resulted primarily from bank notes which are guaranteed by certain officers
and directors of Greystone and from loans provided by certain officers and directors of Greystone. Greystone continues to be dependent
upon its officers and directors to provide and/or secure additional financing and there is no assurance that its officers and directors
will continue to do so. As such, there is no assurance that funding will be available for Greystone to continue operations.
Greystone
has 50,000 outstanding shares of cumulative 2003 Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $5,000,000 and a preferred dividend
rate of the prime rate of interest plus 3.25%. Greystone does not anticipate that it will make cash dividend payments to any holders
of its common stock unless and until the financial position of Greystone improves through increased revenues, another financing transaction
or otherwise. Pursuant to the IBC Loan Agreement, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, Greystone may pay
dividends on its preferred stock in an amount not to exceed $500,000 per year.
Forward
Looking Statements and Material Risks
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking
statements are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that Greystone expects, believes
or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including decreased costs, securing financing, the profitability of Greystone, potential
sales of pallets or other possible business developments, are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to a number of
assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could be affected
by any of the following factors: Greystone’s prospects could be affected by changes in availability of raw materials, competition,
rapid technological change and new legislation regarding environmental matters; Greystone may not be able to secure additional financing
necessary to sustain and grow its operations; and a material portion of Greystone’s business is and will be dependent upon a few
large customers and there is no assurance that Greystone will be able to retain such customers. These risks and other risks that could
affect Greystone’s business are more fully described in Greystone’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, which
was filed on August 19, 2022. Actual results may vary materially from the forward-looking statements. Greystone undertakes no duty to
update any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

4. Controls and Procedures.
As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Greystone carried out an evaluation under the supervision of
Greystone’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Greystone’s
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on an evaluation as of
May 31, 2022, Warren F. Kruger, Greystone’s Chief Executive Officer, and William W. Rahhal, Greystone’s Chief Financial Officer,
identified no material weakness in Greystone’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, Greystone’s CEO and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of Greystone’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of November 30, 2022.
During
the three months ended November 30, 2022, there were no changes in Greystone’s internal controls over financial reporting that
