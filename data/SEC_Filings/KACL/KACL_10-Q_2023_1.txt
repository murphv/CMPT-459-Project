DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS
Kairous
Acquisition Corp. Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 24, 2021. The Company was formed
for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is not limited to a particular industry
or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such,
the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through
December 31, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which
is described below, and negotiation and consummation of an initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating
revenues until after the completion an initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income
in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected June 30 as its fiscal
year end.
The
registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 13, 2021. On December 16, 2021,
the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of
7,500,000
units (“Units” and, with respect to the ordinary shares
included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $ 75,000,000 , which is described in
Note 3. The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to
1,125,000
additional
Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On December
16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option by purchasing
300,000
additional units, generating $ 3,000,000 .
The underwriter has further indicated that they will not exercise the remaining over-allotment option, hence the remaining
825,000
units
will be forfeited.
Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an
aggregate of
348,143
Units (the “Private Placement Units”) to Kairous Asia Limited (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase
price of $ 10.00
per Private Placement Units, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $ 3,481,430 . On December 16, 2021,
the underwriters partially exercised the option at which time the Sponsor purchasing
9,000
additional units, generating $ 90,000 .
As
of December 16, 2021, transaction costs amounted to $ 4,843,252
consisting of $ 1,559,900
of underwriting fees, $ 2,730,000
of deferred
underwriting fees payable (which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the
“Trust Account”) and $ 553,352
of other offering costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Cash of $ 857,408
was held outside
of the Trust Account on December 16, 2021 and was available for working capital purposes. As described in Note 6, the $ 2,730,000
deferred
underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public
Offering.
Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on December 16, 2021, an amount of $ 78,780,000
($ 10.10
per Unit) from the net proceeds of
the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in the Trust Account which may be invested
in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
“Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself
out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by
the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described
below.
The
Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward
consummating a Business Combination. The stock exchange listing rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more
operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least
80 % of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below)
(excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). The Company
will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires
50 % or more of the issued and outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required
to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Initial Public
Offering, management has agreed that $ 10.00
per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, including proceeds of the sale of the Private
Placement Units, will be held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and invested in U.S. government securities, within
the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment
company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii)
the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s shareholders, as described below.
F- 5
The
Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to
redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $ 10.10
per Public
Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded
at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480
“Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.”
All
of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s
liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company’s Business Combination and in connection
with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”).
In accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and its guidance on redeemable equity
instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares will be issued with
other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of the ordinary shares classified as temporary equity
will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The ordinary shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is
probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption
value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable,
if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur
and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected
to recognize the changes immediately. The Public Shares are redeemable and will be classified as such on the condensed balance sheet
until such date that a redemption event takes place. Redemptions of the Company’s Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction
of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to an agreement relating to the Company’s Business Combination.
If
the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the
Company receives an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law approving a Business Combination, which requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company, or such other vote as required by law or stock
exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other
legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents
containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.
If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares
(as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination.
Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether
they vote for or against a proposed Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares
without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.
F- 6
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant
to the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder
is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of
15 % of the Public
Shares without the Company’s prior written consent.
The
Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with
the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
(i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial
Business Combination or to redeem
100 % of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination
Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business
combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval
of any such amendment.
If
the Company has not completed a Business Combination within
12
months (or up to 24 months, if we extend the time to complete a business
combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Combination Period”), the Company will (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem
100 % of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account,
including interest earned and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $ 100,000
of interest to pay dissolution
expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights
of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly
as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining Public Shareholders and its
Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide
for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. On December 14, 2022, the Company issued an unsecured promissory
note, in an amount of $ 360,000 , to the Sponsor in exchange for Sponsor depositing such amount into the Company’s trust account
in order to extend the amount of time it has available to complete a business combination until March 16, 2023.
The
Sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares it will
receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its
respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account
if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights
to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business
Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account
that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share
value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($ 10.00 ).
In
order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent
any claims by a third party (other than the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce
the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) $ 10.10
per Public Share and (2) the actual amount per Public Share
held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $ 10.10
per Public Share, due to reductions
in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply to any
claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and as to any claims under the
Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable
against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will
seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavouring to
have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target
businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
F- 7
Going
Concern Considerations, Liquidity and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had insufficient liquidity to meet its future obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
working capital deficit of $ 475,584
and cash of $ 131,272 . The Company has a history of losses, an accumulated deficit and has not generated
cash from operations to support its ongoing business plan. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs
in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination.
In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it pursues an initial business combination target.
In
connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (“ ASU ”)
No. 2014-15, “ Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ,” management
has determined that its history of losses and insufficient liquidity raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going
concern. In addition to if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing
of the IPO (less than 12 months within filing of these condensed financial statements), the Company is required to cease all operations,
redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The
Company intends to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on
the Trust Account, excluding the deferred underwriting commissions, to complete an initial business combination. To the extent that capital
stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete an initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held
in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue growth strategies. If an initial business combination agreement requires the Company to use a portion of the cash in the Trust
Account to pay the purchase price or requires the Company to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the Company will need to reserve
a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing.
Risks
and Uncertainties
Management
is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could
have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations, close of the Initial Public Offering and/or
search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these condensed financial statements.
Additionally,
as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related
economic sanctions, the Company’s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which
the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Company’s
ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these
events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable
on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable.
The
condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
NOTE

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“US GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed.
As such, the information included in these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements as
of June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Company’s management, these condensed financial statements
include all adjustments, which are only of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial
position as of December 31, 2022 and the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results
of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year
ending June 30, 2023.
Emerging
Growth Company
The
Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic
reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and
shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which
is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
F- 8
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of
a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the condensed financial statements, which management considered
in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results
could differ significantly from those estimates.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
The Company had cash of $ 131,272
and $ 482,965
and
no
cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
Investments
held in Trust Account
As
of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 21.8
million and $ 78.9
million in investments held in the Trust
Account, respectively. The Company’s portfolio of investments held in the Trust Account are invested in U.S. government securities,
within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”),
with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by
the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act.
Offering
Costs associated with the Initial Public Offering
The
Company complies with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) Topic 5A,
“Expenses of Offering.”
Offering costs of $ 894,582
consisted principally
of costs incurred in connection with preparation for the Initial Public Offering. These offering costs, together with the underwriter
fees of $ 4,289,900
(or $ 1,559,900
paid in cash upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and a deferred fee of $ 2,730,000 ), were
charged to stockholders’ equity upon completion of the Initial Public Offering.
Ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption
The
Company accounts for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480
“Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity”.
Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured
at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within
the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control)
are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s
ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company’s control and
subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, shareholders elected to redeem
5,710,184
ordinary shares for a total redemption amount of $ 58,312,401
withdrawn from the Trust Account. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022, the
2,089,816
and
7,800,000
ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, respectively, in the amount of $ 21,823,769
and $ 78,894,512
are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s condensed
balance sheets, respectively.
The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares
to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company
recognized a measurement adjustment from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable
ordinary shares resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.

As
of December 31, 2022, the ordinary shares reflected on the condensed balance sheets is reconciled in the following table:

Warrants
The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and
ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging
(“ ASC 815 ”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial
instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements
for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares and whether
the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control,
among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the
time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
For
issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of equity at the time of issuance. The Company determined that upon further review of the warrant agreements, the Company concluded that
its warrants qualify for equity accounting treatment.
Income
Taxes
The
Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, “ Income Taxes .” Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.
ASC
740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
as income tax expense. There were
no
unrecognized tax benefits and
no
amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022
and June 30, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals
or material deviation from its position.
The
Company may be subject to potential examination by foreign taxing authorities in the area of income taxes. These potential examinations
may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with
foreign tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change
over the next twelve months.
The
Company is considered to be an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently
not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the other tax jurisdictions. Consequently, income
taxes are not reflected in the Company’s condensed financial statements.
Net
Income (Loss) per Ordinary Share
Net
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during
the period, excluding ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company did not have any
dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the
earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share is the same as basic income (loss) per share for the period presented.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution,
which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $ 250,000 . The Company has not experienced losses on this account.
The Company has not experienced any losses on the Trust Account.
F- 10
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820,
“Fair Value
Measurement,”
approximates the carrying amounts represented in the condensed balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term
nature. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in
the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following
fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:
Level
1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or instruments in active markets.
Level
2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
are not active and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level
3 Inputs: Significant inputs into the valuation model are unobservable.
The
Company does not have any recurring Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments
including its cash and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values principally because of their short-term nature.
Share-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, “ Compensation—Stock Compensation ”
(“ASC 718”), which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for share-based employee compensation. It defines
a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument.
The
Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at their fair
value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
Share-based
compensation expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed statements of operations. Share-based payments
issued to placement agents are classified as a direct cost of a share offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in
capital.
Recent
Accounting Standards
Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on the Company’s condensed financial statements.

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
Pursuant
to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold
7,500,000
Units at a purchase price of $ 10.00
per Unit generating gross proceeds to
the Company in the amount of $ 75,000,000 . Each Unit will consist of one ordinary share, one half of one redeemable warrant (“Public
Warrant”) and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination.
Each whole Public Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $ 11.50
per share subject to adjustment
(see Note 7). Each ten rights entitle the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share at the closing of a business combination. The
Company will not issue fractional shares. As a result, shareholders must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for
all of the rights upon closing of a business combination. On December 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment
option by purchasing
300,000
additional units, generating $ 3,000,000 .
NOTE
4 —
PRIVATE PLACEMENTS
Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an
aggregate of
348,143
Units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a purchase price of $ 10.00
per Private Placement Unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $ 3,481,430 . On December 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the option at which
time the Sponsor purchasing
9,000
additional units, generating $ 90,000 .
A
portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Units was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust
Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private
Placement Units held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable
law). The Private Placement Units will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of an Initial Business
Combination, subject to certain exceptions.

RELATED PARTIES
Founder
Shares
On
May 13 and October 21, 2021, the Sponsor received an aggregate of
2,156,250
of the Company’s ordinary shares (the “Founder
Shares”) in exchange for a capital contribution of $ 25,000
that was paid by the Sponsor for deferred offering costs. All share
amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect this number of Founder Shares. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to
281,250
shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment is not exercised in full or in part, so
that the number of Founder Shares will equal, on an as-converted basis, approximately
20 % of the Company’s issued and outstanding
ordinary shares after the Initial Public Offering. Due to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters, these
75,000
shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
The
Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur
of: (A) six months after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) the date of the consummation of our initial business combination,
and subsequently, we consummate a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders
having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (C) after 150 calendar days after the date
of the consummation of our initial business combination, and subsequently, the closing price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds
$ 12.00
per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any
20 trading
days within any 30-trading day period .
General
and Administrative Services
Commencing
on the date the Units are first listed on the Nasdaq, the Company has agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $ 5,000
per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support during the Combination Period. Upon the earlier of the completion of the
Initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. During the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $ 15,000
and $ 2,419
in management fees, respectively. During the six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $ 30,000
and $ 2,419
in management fees, respectively. In addition, the fees due to the
Sponsor under the administrative support agreement, from time to time, the Company will pay the Sponsor for miscellaneous operating expenses.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid the Sponsor $ 5,257
for operating expenses.
Promissory
Note — Related Party
On
April 23, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the “Promissory Note”), pursuant to which
the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $ 200,000 . On May 12, 2021, the amount of promissory note was further increased
to $ 1,000,000 . On December 10, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to provide an extension to the maturity date of the original promissory note.
The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) July 30, 2023 or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Business
Combination. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there was $ 70,000
outstanding under the Promissory Note.
Advances
from Related Party
The
Sponsor paid certain administrative expenses and offering costs on behalf of the Company. These advances are due on demand and are non-interest
bearing. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the related party paid $ 213,746
of offering costs and other expenses on behalf of the Company.
The advances were repaid in full upon completion of the Initial Public Offering. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there was
no
balance due to the related party.
F- 12
Working
Capital Loans
In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain
of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working
Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of
a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $ 1,000,000
of the notes may be converted upon completion
of a Business Combination into units at a price of $ 10.00
per unit. Such units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. In
the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay
the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. On December 14,
2022, the Company issued a non-interest bearing unsecured promissory note, in an amount of $ 360,000 , to the Sponsor in exchange for Sponsor
depositing such amount into the Company’s trust account in order to extend the amount of time it has available to complete a business
combination until March 16, 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there were $ 360,000
and $ 0
outstanding under the Working
Capital Loans.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Registration
Rights
The
holders of the founder shares, Private Placement Units, shares being issued to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering, and units
that may be issued on conversion of Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will
be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of Initial
Public Offering requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities will be entitled to make
up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have
certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business
Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However,
the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration
statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear
the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Underwriting
Agreement
The
Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to
1,125,000
additional Units
to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts. On December 16, 2021, the underwriters
partially exercised the over-allotment option by purchasing
300,000
additional units, generating $ 3,000,000 .
The
underwriters were paid to a cash underwriting discount of $ 0.20
per Unit, or $ 1,500,000
in the aggregate (or $ 1,725,000
in the aggregate
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), payable upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition,
the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of $ 0.35
per Unit, or $ 2,625,000
in the aggregate (or $ 3,018,750
in the aggregate
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from
the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of
the underwriting agreement. Upon partial exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company paid the underwriters an additional fee of
$ 59,900
(net of Representative’s purchase option fee of $ 100 ) and an additional deferred fee of $ 105,000
which will be payable
upon completion of a Business Combination.
The
underwriters were also issued
39,000
Ordinary shares as representative shares, in connection with the IPO. Upon close of the Initial
Public Offering, the Company recorded additional issuance costs of $ 341,230 , the grant date fair value of the shares, with an offset
to additional paid-in capital.
Advisory
Agreement
On
March 9, 2022, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”) in which the company
retains Chardan to provide strategic and capital markets advisory services. As compensation for such services, the Company is to pay
Chardan advisory fees as defined in the agreement which become payable upon the consummation of the business combination.
Business
Combination Agreement
On
December 9, 2022, the Company entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and between the Company, KAC Merger Sub 1, a Cayman Islands exempted company
and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Purchaser”), KAC Merger Sub 2, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly
owned subsidiary of Purchaser (“Merger Sub”), Wellous Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Target”),
the shareholders of the Target (each, a “Shareholder” and collectively, the “Shareholders”), and the principal
beneficial owners of the Target (the “Principal Owners”), pursuant to which (a) the Company will be merged with and into
Purchaser (the “Reincorporation Merger”), with Purchaser surviving the Reincorporation Merger, and (b) Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Target (the “Acquisition Merger”), with the Target surviving the Acquisition Merger as a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (collectively, the “Business Combination”). Following the Business Combination, Purchaser
will be a publicly traded company.
Consideration
Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will issue
26,732,672
ordinary shares with a deemed price per share $ 10.10
for a total value of $ 270,000,000
(“Aggregate Stock Consideration”) to the Shareholders, among which,
26,465,345
ordinary shares (the “Closing Payment
Shares”) will be delivered to the Shareholders at the closing and
267,327
ordinary shares will be held back by Purchaser for one
year after the closing as security for indemnification obligation of the representations and warranties of the Company, the Shareholders
and the Principal Owners as set forth in the Merger Agreement (the “Holdback Shares”).
The
Earnout
Up
to an additional
5,400,000
ordinary shares may be issued to the Shareholders as contingent post-closing earnout consideration. The earnout
milestones are in three tiers, and are based on Purchaser’s performance during the years 2023 through 2027, with specific targets
tied to the trading price of Purchaser’s ordinary shares, Purchaser’s market capitalization and Purchaser’s net profit
after tax.
The
Closing
The
Company and the Target have agreed that the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”) shall occur no later than
September 30, 2023 (the “Outside Date”). The Outside Date may be extended upon the written agreement of Company and the Target.
Minimum
Cash at Closing
The
Company has agreed that as of the date of the Closing, the Company will have minimum cash equal to no less than $ 5,600,000
(“Minimum
Cash”). To the extent that the Company has less than the Minimum Cash amount as of the Closing, then the Shareholders and/or the
Principal Owners shall make up the difference in cash. To the extent that the Company has more than the Minimum Cash amount as of the
Closing, then Purchaser shall pay the difference by issuing additional Purchaser ordinary shares to the Shareholders at a value of $ 10.10
per share.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Ordinary
Shares
— The Company is authorized to issue
500,000,000
ordinary shares with a par value of $ 0.0001
per share. Holders
of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there were
2,346,143
ordinary
shares issued and outstanding in shareholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there were an additional
2,089,816
and
7,800,000
ordinary shares included in temporary equity on the condensed balance sheets, respectively. During the six months ended
December 31, 2022, shareholders elected to redeem
5,710,184
ordinary shares for a total redemption amount of $ 58,312,401
withdrawn from
the Trust Account.
F- 13
Holders
of ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as otherwise required
by law. In connection with our initial business combination, we may enter into a shareholders agreement or other arrangements with the
shareholders of the target or other investors to provide or voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those
in effect upon completion of the IPO.
Rights
— Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a right will
automatically receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of the initial business combination. The Company will
not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole
share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Cayman law.
Warrants
—Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of ordinary share at a price of $ 11.50
per share,
subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination. However,
no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current Form 10-K relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective by the 90th day
following the consummation of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that
exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. In the event
of such cashless exercise, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference
between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The
“fair market value” for this purpose will mean the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading
days ending on the third trading day prior to the date of exercise. The warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion
of an initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
The
private warrants, as well as any warrants underlying additional units the Company issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors, initial
shareholders or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company, will be identical to the warrants underlying
the units being offered.
The
Company may call the warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $ 0.01
per warrant,
●
at
any time after the warrants become exercisable,
●
upon
not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder,
●
if,
and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $16.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits,
stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing at any
time after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders;
and
●
if,
and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants.
The
right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and
after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder’s
warrant upon surrender of such warrant.
The
redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium
to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then- prevailing share price and the warrant exercise
price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below
the exercise price of the warrants.
F- 14
If
the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to
exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering
the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary
shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value”
(defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” for this purpose shall mean the average reported last
sale price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption
is sent to the holders of warrants.
The
warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant
agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder (i) to
cure any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms
of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in this Form 10-K, or to cure, correct or supplement any defective provision, or
(ii) to add or change any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to
the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the interests of the registered
holders of the warrants, but requires the approval, by written consent or vote, of the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding
public warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.
The
warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant
agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full
payment of the exercise price, by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant
holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and
receive ordinary shares. After the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote
for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.
Warrant
holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their warrants such that an electing warrant holder would not be
able to exercise their warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, such holder would beneficially own in excess
of
9.8 % of the ordinary shares outstanding.
No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive
a fractional interest in a share, the Company will, upon exercise, round up to the nearest whole number the number of ordinary shares
to be issued to the warrant holder.

Overview
We
are a blank check company, incorporated on March 24, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company. We were incorporated for the purpose
of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or
more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Quarterly Report as our “initial business combination”. We intend to effectuate
our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”)
and the private placement of the Private Placement Units (as defined below), the sale of certain forward purchase securities, our shares
(other backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), securities, debt
or a combination of cash, equity and debt.
We
held our annual meeting of shareholders on December 2, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Meeting”). During the 2022 Annual Meeting,
shareholders approved, among other things, (x) the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by
which the Company has the right to extend the time to complete a business combination eight (8) times, as follows: (i) two (2) times
for an additional three (3) months each time from December 16, 2022 to June 16, 2023 for each three-month extension, followed by (ii)
six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time from June 16, 2023 to December 16, 2023 for each one-month extension; (y) an
amendment to the Company’s investment management trust agreement, dated December 13, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company to extend the time to complete a business combination eight (8) times, as follows: (i) two (2) times
for an additional three (3) months each time from December 16, 2022 to June 16, 2023 by depositing $360,000 to the trust account for
each three-month extension, followed by (ii) six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time from June 16, 2023 to December 16,
2023 by depositing $120,000 to the trust account for each one-month extension; and (z) elected all of the six nominees for directors
to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders approved.
On
December 14, 2022, we issued an unsecured promissory note, in an amount of $360,000 to Kairous Asia Limited, the Company’s initial
public offering sponsor (“Sponsor”) in exchange for Sponsor depositing such amount into the Company’s trust account
in order to extend the amount of time it has available to complete a business combination until March 16, 2023. The promissory note may
be converted, at the lender’s discretion, into additional private units.
Business
Combination Agreement
On
December 9, 2022, the Company entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and between the Company, KAC Merger Sub 1, a Cayman Islands exempted company
and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Purchaser”), KAC Merger Sub 2, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly
owned subsidiary of Purchaser (“Merger Sub”), Wellous Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Target”),
the shareholders of the Target (each, a “Shareholder” and collectively, the “Shareholders”), and the principal
beneficial owners of the Target (the “Principal Owners”), pursuant to which (a) the Company will be merged with and into
Purchaser (the “Reincorporation Merger”), with Purchaser surviving the Reincorporation Merger, and (b) Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Target (the “Acquisition Merger”), with the Target surviving the Acquisition Merger as a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (collectively, the “Business Combination”). Following the Business Combination, Purchaser
will be a publicly traded company.
Consideration
Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will issue 26,732,672 ordinary shares with a deemed price per share US$10.10 for a total value of
$270,000,000 (“Aggregate Stock Consideration”) to the Shareholders, among which, 26,465,345 ordinary shares (the “Closing
Payment Shares”) will be delivered to the Shareholders at the closing and 267,327 ordinary shares will be held back by Purchaser
for one year after the closing as security for indemnification obligation of the representations and warranties of the Company, the Shareholders
and the Principal Owners as set forth in the Merger Agreement (the “Holdback Shares”).
The
Earnout
Up
to an additional 5,400,000 ordinary shares may be issued to the Shareholders as contingent post-closing earnout consideration. The earnout
milestones are in three tiers, and are based on Purchaser’s performance during the years 2023 through 2027, with specific targets
tied to the trading price of Purchaser’s ordinary shares, Purchaser’s market capitalization and Purchaser’s net profit
after tax.
The
Closing
The
Company and the Target have agreed that the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”) shall occur no later than
September 30, 2023 (the “Outside Date”). The Outside Date may be extended upon the written agreement of Company and the Target.
Minimum
Cash at Closing
The
Company has agreed that as of the date of the Closing, the Company will have minimum cash equal to no less than $5,600,000 (“Minimum
Cash”). To the extent that the Company has less than the Minimum Cash amount as of the Closing, then the Shareholders and/or the
Principal Owners shall make up the difference in cash. To the extent that the Company has more than the Minimum Cash amount as of the
Closing, then Purchaser shall pay the difference by issuing additional Purchaser ordinary shares to the Shareholders at a value of $10.10
per share.
Results
of Operations
We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from March 24,
2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public
Offering and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate
any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form
of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held after the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public
company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of $112,194, which resulted from operating costs of $413,891 offset by interest
income on the operating account and the investments held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) in the amount of $526,085.
For
or the three months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $15,214, which resulted from operating costs of $15,446 partially offset
by interest income on investments held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) in the amount of $232.
For
the six months ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of $271,478 , which resulted from operating costs of $610,199 offset by
interest income on the operating account and the investments held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) in the amount
of $881,677.
For
the six months ended December 31, 2021,
we had a net loss of $20,938, which resulted from operating
costs of $21,170 partially offset by interest income on investments held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) in the
amount of $232.
3
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
On
December 16, 2021, we consummated an Initial Public Offering of 7,800,000 Units (the “Units”) generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $78,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale
(the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 357,143 Units (the “Private Placement Units”) to Kairous Asia Limited
(the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Units, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the
amount of $3,571,430.
For
the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $351,693, which was due to net income of $271,478 and
interest income on investments held in the Trust Account of $881,658, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities
of $258,487.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash of $131,272 held outside the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account
primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents
and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete an initial business combination.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had insufficient liquidity to meet its future obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
working capital deficit of $475,584 and cash of $131,272. The Company has a history of losses, an accumulated deficit and has not generated
cash from operations to support its ongoing business plan. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs
in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination.
In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it pursues an initial business combination target.
In
connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (“ ASU ”)
No. 2014-15, “ Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ,” management
has determined that its history of losses and insufficient liquidity raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going
concern. In addition to if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing
of the IPO (less than 12 months within filing of these condensed financial statements), the Company is required to cease all operations,
redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The
Company intends to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on
the Trust Account, excluding the deferred underwriting commissions, to complete an initial business combination. To the extent that capital
stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete an initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held
in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue growth strategies. If an initial business combination agreement requires the Company to use a portion of the cash in the Trust
Account to pay the purchase price or requires the Company to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the Company will need to reserve
a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022.
Contractual
Obligations
Registration
Rights
The
holders of the founder shares, Private Placement Units, shares being issued to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering, and units
that may be issued on conversion of Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will
be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of Initial
Public Offering requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities will be entitled to make
up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have
certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business
Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However,
the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration
statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear
the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
4
Underwriting
Agreement
The
Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the
Initial Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, which the underwriter partially exercised in full, and
the additional Units were issued on December 16, 2021.
The
underwriter was paid a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $1,559,900 in the aggregate. In addition, the underwriter is
entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $2,730,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter
from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a business combination, subject to the terms
of the underwriting agreement.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported.
Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Ordinary
Shares Subject to Possible Redemption
All
of the 7,800,000 ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for
the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer
in connection with a business combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in
ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be
classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all ordinary shares have been classified outside of permanent equity.
The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares
to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary
shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.
Net
Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share
Net
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during
the period, excluding ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive
securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings
of the Company. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share is the same as basic income (loss) per share for the period presented.
Recent
Accounting Standards
Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on the Company’s financial statements.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022.
ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
As
of December 31, 2022, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk.
ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
5
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. Based upon their
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of such date.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
On
December 16, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 7,800,000 units (the “Units”)
(including the issuance of 300,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s partial exercise of the over-allotment option). Each
Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), one-half of one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder
to purchase one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon
the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds
of $78,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated a private placement (“Private Placement”)
of 357,143 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,571,430. A
total of $78,780,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option units) and the Private
Placements on December 16, 2021, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders.
The
Private Units are identical to the units sold in the IPO except with respect to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions.
The holders of the Private Units have agreed (A) to vote the private shares underlying the Private Units (the “Private Shares”)
and any public shares acquired by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment
to the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company’s pre-business combination
activities prior to the consummation of a business combination unless the Company offers holders of IPO shares the right to receive their
pro rata portion of the funds then held in the trust account, (C) not to convert any Private Shares for cash from the trust account in
connection with a shareholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (D)
that the Private Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated.
Our sponsor has also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except to the same permitted
transferees as the insider shares and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees
of the insider shares must agree to, each as described above) until the completion of our initial business combination.
We
paid a total of $1,560,000, in underwriting discounts and commissions (not including the 3.5% deferred underwriting commission payable
at the consummation of initial business combination) and $552,288 for other costs and expenses related to our formation and the IPO.
On
December 14, 2022, we issued an unsecured promissory note, in an amount of $360,000 to Kairous Asia Limited, the Company’s initial
public offering sponsor (“Sponsor”) in exchange for Sponsor depositing such amount into the Company’s trust account
in order to extend the amount of time it has available to complete a business combination until March 16, 2023. The promissory note may
be converted, at the lender’s discretion, into additional private units.
