NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) All amounts included in the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise noted. Note 1.  Description of Business and Basis of Presentation Description of Business Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” “MSG Sports,” or the “Company”) owns and operates a portfolio of assets featuring some of the most recognized teams in all of sports, including the New York Knickerbockers (“Knicks”) of the National Basketball Association (“NBA”) and the New York Rangers (“Rangers”) of the National Hockey League (“NHL”). Both the Knicks and the Rangers play their home games in Madison Square Garden Arena (“The Garden”). The Company’s other professional sports franchises include two development league teams — the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League and the Westchester Knicks of the NBA G League. These professional sports franchises are collectively referred to herein as the “sports teams.” In addition, the Company owns Knicks Gaming, an esports franchise that competes in the NBA 2K League, as well as a controlling interest in Counter Logic Gaming (“CLG”), a North American esports organization. The Company also operates two professional sports team performance centers — the Madison Square Garden Training Center in Greenburgh, NY and the CLG Performance Center in Los Angeles, CA. CLG and Knicks Gaming are collectively referred to herein as the “esports teams,” and together with the sports teams, the “teams.” The Company operates and reports financial information in
one
segment. The Company’s decision to organize as
one
operating segment and report in
one
segment is based upon its internal organizational structure; the manner in which its operations are managed; the criteria used by the Company’s Executive Chairman, its Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), to evaluate segment performance. The Company’s CODM reviews total company operating results to assess overall performance and allocate resources. The Company was incorporated on March 4, 2015 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MSG Networks Inc. (“MSG Networks”). All the outstanding common stock of the Company was distributed to MSG Networks shareholders (the “MSGS Distribution”) on September 30, 2015. On April 17, 2020 (the “MSGE Distribution Date”), the Company distributed all of the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. (formerly MSG Entertainment Spinco, Inc. and referred to herein as “MSG Entertainment”) to its stockholders (the “MSGE Distribution”). Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements (referred to as the “Financial Statements” herein) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC for interim financial information, and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”). The Financial Statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, the Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future interim periods or for the full year. The dependence of MSG Sports on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company’s fiscal year, which is when the majority of the teams’ games are played.
10 Table of Contents MADISON SQUARE GARDEN SPORTS CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
During fiscal years 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 disruptions and actions taken in response by governmental authorities and the leagues materially impacted the Company’s revenues and the Company recognized materially less revenues, or in some cases, no revenues, across a number of areas. In fiscal year 2022, the Company’s operations and operating results were also impacted by temporary declines in attendance due to ongoing reduced tourism levels as well as an increase in COVID-19 cases during certain months of the fiscal year. See Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business during fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022. It is unclear to what extent COVID-19, including new variants thereof, could result in renewed governmental and/or league restrictions on attendance or otherwise impact the Company’s operations and operating results. Note 2.
Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts from CLG, in which the Company has a controlling voting interest. The Company’s consolidation criteria are based on authoritative accounting guidance for voting interest, controlling interest or variable interest entities. CLG is consolidated with the equity owned by other shareholders shown as nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and the other shareholders’ portion of net earnings (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) shown as net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, deferred tax valuation allowance, and other liabilities. In addition, estimates are used in revenue recognition, revenue sharing expense (net of escrow), luxury tax expense, income tax expense, performance and share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, litigation matters and other matters, as well as in the valuation of contingent consideration and noncontrolling interests resulting from business combination transactions. Management believes its use of estimates in the Financial Statements to be reasonable. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the general economic environment and actions it may take in the future. The Company adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, these estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on management’s best judgment at a point in time and, as such, these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. Changes in estimates resulting from weakness in the economic environment or other factors beyond the Company’s control could be material and would be reflected in the Company’s financial statements in future periods. 11 Table of Contents MADISON SQUARE GARDEN SPORTS CORP.

The increases in revenues from local media rights for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to contractual rate increases. The increases in revenues from league distributions for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to increased NBA and NHL national media rights fees and other league distributions in the current year periods. Direct operating expenses Direct operating expenses increased $32,855, or 17%, to $225,702 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year period. Direct operating expenses increased $27,958, or 14%, to $229,383 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year period. The net increases were attributable to the following:   Three Six Months Months Increase in team personnel compensation $ 19,083  $ 19,338  Increase in other team operating expenses 7,406  7,036  Increase in operating lease costs associated with the Knicks and Rangers playing home games at The Garden 3,932  3,932  Increase in pre/regular season expense associated with merchandise sales 2,556  2,460  Increase (decrease) in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax 1,137  (2,493) Decrease in net provisions for certain team personnel transactions (1,259) (2,315) $ 32,855  $ 27,958  The increases in team personnel compensation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to the impact of roster changes for the Knicks and the Rangers. The increases in other team operating expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to higher per-game average expenses and the Rangers playing additional games at The Garden during the current year periods as compared to the prior year periods. Other team operating expenses primarily consists of expenses associated with day-to-day operations, including variable day-of-event costs incurred at The Garden, team travel, player insurance, and league assessments. The increases in operating lease costs associated with the Knicks and the Rangers playing home games at The Garden for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were related to the Rangers playing additional games at The Garden during the current year periods as compared to the prior year periods. The increases in pre/regular season expense associated with merchandise sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to higher merchandise sales as a result of higher average Knicks and Rangers per-game revenue and the Rangers playing additional games at The Garden during the current year periods as compared to the prior year periods. Net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Increase 2022 2021 Decrease Net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax $ 20,958  $ 19,821  $ 1,137  $ 18,784  $ 21,277  $ (2,493) The increase in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to the net impact of adjustments to prior seasons’ revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs), partially offset by higher estimated recoveries of NBA luxury tax in the current year period. The decrease in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to the net impact of adjustments to prior seasons’ revenue
30 Table of Contents sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and higher estimated recoveries of NBA luxury tax in the current year period.
The Knicks were not a luxury tax payer for the 2021-22 season and, therefore, received an equal share of the portion of luxury tax receipts that were distributed to non-tax paying teams. The Knicks’ roster as of December 31, 2022 would not result in the team being a luxury tax payer for the 2022-23 season.
The actual amounts for the 2022-23 seasons may vary significantly from the recorded provisions based on actual operating results for each league and all teams within each league for the season and other factors. Net provisions for certain team personnel transactions were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Waivers/contract terminations $ 29  $ (69) $ 98  $ (1,392) $ 658  $ (2,050) Player trades —  —  —  1,092  —  1,092  Season-ending player injuries —  1,357  (1,357) —  1,357  (1,357) Net provisions for certain team personnel transactions $ 29  $ 1,288  $ (1,259) $ (300) $ 2,015  $ (2,315) Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $16,036, or 27%, to $75,636 as compared to the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $27,589, or 27%, to $130,917 as compared to the prior ye ar period. The increases were primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits, including executive management transition costs recorded in the current year periods, as well as higher marketing costs. In addition, for the six months ended December 31, 2022, higher employee compensation and related benefits included the impact of staffing increases relative to the prior year period reflecting the business’ return to normal operations. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $377, or 31%, to $838 as compared to the prior year period. Depreciation and amortization for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $778 or 29% to $1,863 as compared to the prior year period. Operating income Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $15,599, or 43%, to $51,518 as compared to the prior year period. Operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $14,639 to $15,620 as compared to the prior year period. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 the increases in operating income were primaril y due to increases in revenues, partially offset by higher direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Interest expense, net Net interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $1,970, or 56%, to $5,512 as compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $1,873, or 28%, to $8,468 as compared to the prior yea r period. The increases were primarily due to higher interest rates in the current year periods causing increased interest expense under the Knicks and the Rangers revolving credit facilities. The increases were partially offset by (i) higher interest income due to increased interest rates in the current year periods and (ii) the acceleration of previously incurred financing costs that were recognized in the prior year periods as a result of the Company terminating the 2020 Knicks Holdings Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 the increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower average borrowings under the Rangers revolving credit facility in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 31 Table of Contents Income taxes See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in “Part I — Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussions of the Company’s income taxes. Adjusted operating income The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is operating income (loss) excluding (i) deferred rent expense under the Arena License Agreements with MSG Entertainment, (ii) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, (iii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iv) restructuring charges or credits, (v) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses, (vi) the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions, and (vii) gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (which was established in November 2021), which is referred to as adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure. Management believes that given the length of the Arena License Agreements and resulting magnitude of the difference in deferred rent expense and the cash rent payments, the exclusion of deferred rent expense provides investors with a clearer picture of the Company’s operating performance. Management believes that this adjustment is beneficial for other incremental reasons as well. This adjustment provides senior management, investors and analysts with important information regarding a long-term related party agreement with MSG Entertainment. In addition, this adjustment is a component of the performance measures used to evaluate, and compensate, senior management of the Company. Management believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the Company’s business without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash. In addition, management believes that the exclusion of gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provides investors with a clearer picture of the Company’s operating performance given that, in accordance with GAAP, gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan are recognized in Operating (income) loss whereas gains and losses related to the remeasurement of the assets under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which are equal to and therefore fully offset the gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities, are recognized in Miscellaneous income (expense), net, which is not reflected in Operating income (loss).
The Company believes adjusted operating income (loss) is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating income (loss) and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze the Company’s performance. The Company uses revenues and adjusted operating income (loss) measures as the most important indicators of its business performance and evaluates management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. Adjusted operating income (loss) should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Since adjusted operating income (loss) is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. The Company has presented the components that reconcile operating income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to adjusted operating income (loss). The following are the reconciliations of operating income to adjusted operating income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year periods: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, Change December 31, Change 2022 2021 $ % 2022 2021 $ % Operating income $ 51,518  $ 35,919  $ 15,599  43  % $ 15,620  $ 981  $ 14,639  NM Deferred rent 12,202  11,179  12,708  11,708  Depreciation and amortization 838  1,215  1,863  2,641  Share-based compensation 11,619  7,354  18,839  12,205  Remeasurement of deferred compensation plan liabilities 449  —  346  —  Adjusted operating income $ 76,626  $ 55,667  $ 20,959  38  % $ 49,376  $ 27,535  $ 21,841  79  % For the three months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted operating income
incr eased $20,959 to $76,626 as compared to the prior year period. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted operating income increased $21,841 to $49,376 as compared to the prior year period. The increases in adjusted operating income were p rimarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. 32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, and cash flow from our operations. On December 14, 2021, the Company amended and extended the 2020 Knicks Credit Agreement and the 2020 Rangers Credit Agreement. In addition, in March 2021, pursuant to the 2021 Rangers NHL Advance Agreement (the “2021 Rangers NHL Advance Agreement”), the NHL advanced the Company $30,000, which the league made available to each of its member teams. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in “Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the 2021 Knicks Credit Agreement, 2021 Rangers Credit Agreement, and 2021 Rangers NHL Advance Agreement. Our principal uses of cash include the operation of our businesses, working capital-related items, the repayment of outstanding debt, the payment of a special, one-time cash dividend of $7.00 per share (the “Special Dividend”), repurchases of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, including $75,000 under the ASR (as defined below), and investments.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximatel y $44,000 in C ash and cash equivale nts. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s deferred revenue obligations were approximately $183,844, net of billed, but not yet collected deferred revenue. This balance is primarily comprised of obligations in connection with tickets, suites and local media rights. In addition, the Company’s deferred revenue obligations included $30,000 from the NBA, which the league provided to each team. We regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements. The decisions of the Company as to the use of its available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, management’s view of a favorable allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent the Company desires to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, restrictions imposed by the NBA and NHL and potentially challenging U.S. and global economic and market conditions could adversely impact its ability to do so at that time. We believe we have sufficient liquidity, including approximatel y
$44,000 in
Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, along
with
$120,000 of additional available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities, to fund our operations and satisfy any obligations for the foreseeable future. In addition, on February 3, 2023, the Company made an additional principal repayment of $15,000 under the
2021 Rangers Revolving Credit Facility. Financing Agreements and Stock Repurchases See Note 11 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in “Part I — Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussions of the Company’s debt obligations and various financing agreements, and the Company’s stock repurchases, respectively. Special Dividend and Accelerated Share Repurchase
On October 6, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared the Special Dividend payable on October 31, 2022 to shareholders of record on October 17, 2022. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company made payments of $170,683 related to the Special Dividend. On October 6, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $75,000 accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program under the Company’s existing share repurchase authorization. On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into a $75,000 ASR agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JP Morgan”). Pursuant to the ASR agreement, the Company made a payment of $75,000 to JP Morgan and JP Morgan delivered 388,777 initial shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company on November 1, 2022, representing 80% of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the ASR (determined based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock of $154.33 on October 28, 2022). The ASR was completed on January
31, 2023 with JP Morgan delivering 67,681 additional shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company upon final settlement. The average purchase price per share for shares of Class A Common Stock purchased by the Company pursuant to the ASR was $164.31 . 33 Table of Contents Borrowings under Revolving Credit Facilities In connection with the Special Dividend and ASR, on October 27, 2022, the Company borrowed an additional
$55,000
under the 2021 Knicks Revolving Credit Facility and
$160,000
under the 2021 Rangers Revolving Credit Facility. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company made principal repayments of
$15,000 under the
2021 Knicks Revolving Credit Facility and
$15,000 under the 2021 Rangers Revolving Credit Facility.
Following the additional borrowings and principal repayments, the Company has $120,000 of additional available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities.
Contractual Obligations The Company did not have any material changes in its contractual obligations since the end of fiscal year 2022 other than activities in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flow Discussion The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flow activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net income (loss) $ 3,309  $ (1,687) Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash used in operating activities 25,283  12,053  Changes in working capital assets and liabilities 2,985  13,664  Net cash provided by operating activities 31,577  24,030  Net cash used in investing activities (1,314) (627) Net cash used in financing activities (76,123) (39,879) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (45,860) $ (16,476) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $31,577 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities in the prior year period of $24,030. This was primarily due to the increase in net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by the impact of changes in working capital assets and liabilities. Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $687 to $1,314 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher other investing activities and capital expenditures in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $36,244 to $76,123 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the payment of the Special Dividend and the ASR in the current year period, partially offset by additional net borrowings under the Knicks and the Rangers credit facilities in the current year period as compared to the prior year period.
Seasonality of Our Business The Company’s dependence on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means that it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company’s fiscal year, which is when the majority of the teams’ games are played.
34 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies The following discussion has been included to provide the results of our annual impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets performed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill as of December 31, 2022 was $226,955. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31 st
and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is the same as or one level below the operating segment level. The Company has one operating and reportable segment, and one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. The amount of an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value determined in step one, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for the Company’s reporting unit for the fiscal year 2023 impairment test. These assessments considered factors such as: • macroeconomic conditions; • industry and market considerations; • market capitalization;
• cost factors; • overall financial performance of the reporting unit; • other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and • relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets. The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, and there was no impairment of goodwill. Based on this impairment test, the Company concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Identifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of August 31 st
and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022:   Sports franchises $ 111,064  Photographic related rights 1,080  $ 112,144  The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, the Company must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill has a carrying amount that more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company must proceed to conducting a quantitative analysis, if the Company (i) determines that such an impairment is more likely than not to exist, or (ii) forgoes the qualitative assessment entirely. Under the quantitative
35 Table of Contents assessment, the impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For all periods presented, the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for the indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assessments considered the events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset. Examples of such events and circumstances include: • cost factors; • financial performance; • legal, regulatory, contractual, business or other factors; • other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; • industry and market considerations; and • macroeconomic conditions. The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, and there were no impairments identified. Based on this impairment test, the Company concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was less than their carrying amount. Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There were no material changes to the disclosures regarding market risks in connection with our interest rate risk exposure. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. In addition, see Item 2, “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Factors Affecting Results of Operations — Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussions of disruptions caused by COVID-19.
Potential interest rate risk exposure: We have potential interest rate risk exposure related to outstanding borrowings incurred under our credit facilities. Changes in interest rates may increase interest expense payments with respect to any borrowings incurred under the credit facilities. Borrowings under our credit facilities incur interest, depending on our election, at a floating rate based upon SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment, the U.S. Federal Funds Rate or the U.S. Prime Rate, plus, in each case, a fixed spread. If appropriate, we may seek to reduce such exposure through the use of interest rate swaps or similar instruments. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of
$405 million borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in floating interest rates prevailing as of December 31, 2022 and continuing for a full year would increase interest expense by approximately $4.1 million.  Item 4.
Controls and Procedures An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including our Executive Chairman (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022 the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Legal Proceedings The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits. Although the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty (including the extent of available insurance, if any), management does not believe that resolution of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company. Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Share Repurchase Program
On October 6, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $75 million accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program under the Company’s existing share repurchase authorization. On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into a $75 million ASR agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JP Morgan”). Pursuant to the ASR agreement, the Company made a payment of $75 million to JP Morgan and JP Morgan delivered 388,777 initial shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company on November 1, 2022, representing 80% of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the ASR (determined based
on the closing price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock of $154.33 on October 28, 2022). The ASR was completed on January 31, 2023 with JP Morgan delivering 67,681 additional shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company upon final settlement. The average purchase price per share for shares of Class A Common Stock purchased by the Company pursuant to the ASR was $164.31. The ASR was effected pursuant to the Company’s existing share r epurchase authorization and as of
December 31, 2022 , the Company had approximately $185 million available for repurchases under this existing share repurchase authorization. Under the authorization, shares of Class A Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or private transactions, block trades or such other manner as the Company may determine, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing and amount of purchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. See Note 14 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
